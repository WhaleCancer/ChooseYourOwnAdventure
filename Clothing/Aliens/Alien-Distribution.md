# Alien Distribution

**Type:** Setting information / Regional patterns  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

Different types of aliens are reported in different regions of the world, suggesting either regional preferences, different alien species, or cultural influences on how encounters are interpreted and reported.

## North America

- **[Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)** are the most commonly reported alien in North American abduction cases
- **Mantids** are sometimes reported in abduction stories alongside Greys
- **Robotic Entities** are reported rarely, usually as assistants/companions to Greys during abduction narratives
- **[Reptilians](./Creatures/Aliens/Reptilians.md)** are commonly mentioned in conspiracy theories

## Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom

- **[Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)** are reported here, but less commonly than in North America
- **Mantids** are sometimes reported in abduction stories alongside Greys
- **Robotic Entities** are reported rarely, usually as assistants/companions to Greys during abduction narratives
- **[Reptilians](./Creatures/Aliens/Reptilians.md)** are commonly mentioned in conspiracy theories

## Europe

- **[Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)** are reported here, but less commonly than in North America
- **Mantids** are reported in abduction stories alongside Greys
- **Robotic Entities** are reported rarely, usually as assistants/companions to Greys during abduction narratives

## South America

- Some limited reports of **[Reptilians](./Creatures/Aliens/Reptilians.md)**
- **Chupacabra** - Reports of alien-like creatures attacking livestock

## Soviet Union

- Encounters often include **tall, robot-like beings** with metallic suits
- **[Tall Robotic Explorers](./Creatures/Aliens/Tall-Robotic-Explorers.md)** are most commonly reported in remote Soviet territories

## Nordics (Tall, Blonde "Space Brothers")

**Where:**
- **Scandinavia/Northern Europe:** Descriptions influenced by human Nordic features
- **United States:** 1950s–60s "contactee" era (George Adamski, Howard Menger). Contactees often described benevolent, human-like beings
- **South America:** Some contactees in Brazil and Argentina report interactions with Nordic types

**Why:**
- Early European and American lore romanticized "space brothers" as benevolent

## Tall Whites

**Where:**
- **United States:** Especially popularized by Charles Hall's claims about Nellis AFB, Nevada
- **Limited reports:** Not widely reported outside American military/UFO conspiracy circles

## Other Regional Types

- **Blue Avians:**
  - Emerged mainly in recent Disclosure/New Age communities, especially in the U.S. (Corey Goode claims, Gaia TV, etc.)

- **Light Beings/Orbs:**
  - Witnessed worldwide—Europe (France, Spain), South America (Brazil), and Russia. Sometimes associated with spiritual visions

## Special Regional Types

- **Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Peru):**
  - **"Caboclos" or "Duendes":** Mythic creatures sometimes reinterpreted as aliens in modern lore

- **Africa:**
  - Some reports ("Tokoloshe" etc.) merge local mythology and modern UFO narratives

## In Play

Alien distribution serves as:

- **Regional flavor** - Different types of encounters in different areas
- **Investigation clues** - Patterns suggesting different alien species or operations
- **Cultural influence** - How local culture affects interpretation of encounters
- **Campaign variety** - Different threats and encounters in different regions
- **Conspiracy elements** - Patterns suggesting organized alien activities

### Game Considerations

- Regional distribution creates variety in encounters
- The patterns suggest either different species or cultural interpretation
- The connection to local mythology adds depth
- The Soviet focus on robots creates unique encounter opportunities
- The North American focus on Greys ties into the main setting
