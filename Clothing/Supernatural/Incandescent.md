# Incandescent

**Type:** Planar entity / Energy creature  
**Origin:** Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance  
**Era:** Present when dimensional crossings occur

## Overview

**Incandescents** are ageless creatures of pure radiant energy native to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance that subsist upon colors, both the naturally reoccurring ones of the plane and those of non-native creatures.

## Physical Description

An individual incandescent is a minuscule mote of light, measuring roughly 1/4 millimeters. They appear as tiny points of brilliant light, often gathering in large clouds or swarms.

## Abilities

### Color Draining

When working as a group, incandescent can drain the color from any creature within very short range of them in under a few minutes. This draining of color renders the victim and their possessions transparent, making them effectively invisible to both themselves and others, and thus causing them to lose all awareness of their own body.

**Combat:** When preying upon planar travelers, they attack in large masses. Individually, they can do little, but in a cloud of 30 or more, these little motes of light can drain the color from an Agent in just a few minutes' time. All they need to do is stay within very short range of the victim for 1d4 consecutive rounds. At the end of that time, the target gets to make a saving throw versus spell. If he fails the roll, he and his possessions lose their color and become transparent.

### Transparency Effects

Transparency is a bit like invisibility, but the victim can't even see his own body, so he faces a -2 penalty to all die rolls involving physical maneuvers. Transparent Agents also tend to bump into things, stub their toes, and the like—they lose all awareness of their body.

It's difficult if not impossible to use transparent items. Whether a basher is visible or color-drained, he suffers a -2 penalty when trying to use a transparent weapon or similarly physical item. Transparent shields offer no bonus, because the wielder can't see the shield to know where it gives protection and where it doesn't.

### Reversal

Thankfully, the creatures' strange effect can be reversed. Mundane means such as paint or dyes work as well, after a fashion. Temporary methods include new clothing and wrappings. The effect can also be cured with dust of appearance or the remove curse spell.

### Immunities and Vulnerabilities

Incandescents can be struck only by weapons of +1 or greater enchantment. Because they're creatures of energy, they're immune to magic that alters physical forms, such as that which paralyzes, petrifies, polymorphs, or disintegrates. However, darkness spells drive them away, and physical barriers like walls of force or walls of ice keep them at bay.

### Telepathy

Incandescents can telepathically communicate with any other incandescent in sight.

## Society

Incandescents live in intricate societies based around huge, permanent cloud-clusters. Each community is an autonomous egalitarian collective consisting of many thousands or millions of incandescent. Many incandescent travel in hunting clouds in search of non-native creatures, as their colors differed from those naturally occurring on the plane in subtle degrees noticeable only to them.

It was unknown to scholars how, or even if, the incandescent reproduced. Some theorized that they couldn't and thus only a finite number of them existed.

## Dimensional Crossings

The most common way for an incandescent to make its way into our dimension is by hitching a ride during a crossing by outsiders or the launching of Flying Saucers. Usually, only a few get through. Not enough to be a threat or have a major impact. Sometimes, however, frequent crossings in the same area or a flubbed crossing that catches an incandescent swarm can result in a dangerous threat.

Ultimately, many incandescent fall victim to Earth spiders, preventing them from becoming a permanent fixture in our dimension.

## Relationships

In regards to other natives of their plane, they were considered by radiance quasi-elementals to be mere annoyances, rather than a threat. And darklights sometimes formed strange, symbiotic alliances with incandescent that craved the colors of planewalking outsiders.

## In Play

Incandescents serve as:

- **Planar threat** - Dangerous entities that can enter our dimension through dimensional crossings
- **Color-draining encounters** - Unique combat scenarios with transparency effects
- **Swarm combat** - Large groups of tiny creatures creating dangerous situations
- **Dimensional investigation** - Evidence of planar crossings and interdimensional activity
- **Unusual threat** - Creatures that require special weapons and tactics to defeat

### Game Considerations

- Incandescents are most dangerous in large swarms (30+)
- The color-draining effect creates unique challenges and roleplaying opportunities
- The connection to dimensional crossings ties into Outsider and alien activity
- Earth spiders provide a natural predator, preventing permanent infestations
- The transparency effect can be reversed, but creates immediate tactical disadvantages
- Requires +1 or better weapons to harm, making them a significant threat to unprepared agents
