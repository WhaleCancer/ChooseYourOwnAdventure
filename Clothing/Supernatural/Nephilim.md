# Nephilim

**Type:** Supernatural beings / Hybrid creatures  
**Origin:** Offspring of Outsiders and humans  
**Era:** Present throughout history, active in 1985

## Overview

The **Nephilim** (Hebrew: נְפִילִים) are mysterious beings or humans in the Bible traditionally imagined as being of great size and strength, or alternatively beings of great power and authority. The origins of the Nephilim are disputed. Some, including the author of the Book of Enoch, view them as the offspring of rebellious angels and humans.

> [!info] Theory
> Analysis believes the Nephilim refer to humans born to one or more parents who were possessed by outsiders during conception. It's not clear why outsiders would have an interest in sex outside of procreation, so Analysis believes all Nephilim are intentional pregnancies. It's also been pointed out that Jesus may have been a Nephilim or similar, given his unclear parentage. 
> 
> Conceptually, the concepts of Demigods in Greek Mythology aligns closely with Nephilim, and Analysis believes them to be referring to the same thing. 
> 
> Note that Gods sometimes possess animals in myth and, given their ability to possesses humans, we can assume outsiders can and do possess animals if it suits their purpose. With that in mind, it may also be the case that animal Nephilim exist or have existed.

## Modern Nephilim: Men in Black

The [Men in Black](./Creatures/Supernatural/Nephilim/Men-in-Black.md) are a form of engineered, modern-day Nephilim. They are created scientifically by the Greys implanting and harvesting fetuses in human women. The resulting humans have their growth accelerated in undersea bases; they are essentially programmed for their task and then returned to the human world as agents and infiltrators of the outsiders.

## Characteristics

Nephilim typically display:

- **Enhanced physical abilities** - Greater size, strength, or other physical attributes
- **Supernatural powers** - Abilities beyond normal human capabilities
- **Unusual parentage** - Born from one or more parents possessed by Outsiders
- **Intentional creation** - All Nephilim are believed to be intentional pregnancies, not accidents

## Historical Context

Nephilim appear throughout history and mythology:

- **Biblical accounts** - Described in Genesis and the Book of Enoch
- **Greek mythology** - Demigods like Hercules and Perseus
- **Other traditions** - Similar hybrid beings in various cultures

The connection between these historical accounts and modern encounters suggests that Outsider possession and hybrid creation has been occurring for millennia.

## Relationship with Other Elements

- **Outsiders:** Nephilim are created when Outsiders possess humans during conception
- **Greys:** Modern Men in Black are created through Grey genetic engineering programs
- **Humans:** Nephilim may appear human but possess enhanced abilities
- **Abominations:** Humans can only create Abominations, not true Nephilim

## In Play

Nephilim serve as:

- **Antagonists** - Men in Black agents working against investigators
- **Mysterious NPCs** - Characters with unexplained abilities or origins
- **Investigation targets** - Cases involving unusual individuals with supernatural traits
- **Historical connections** - Links between ancient mythology and modern encounters

### Game Considerations

- Nephilim blur the line between human and supernatural
- The connection to Outsiders adds cosmic horror elements
- Modern Men in Black represent a technological approach to creating Nephilim
- Historical accounts provide context for understanding these beings
- The intentional nature of Nephilim creation suggests larger conspiracies and plans
