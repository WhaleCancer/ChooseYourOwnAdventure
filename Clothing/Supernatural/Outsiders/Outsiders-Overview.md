# The Nine Outsiders (Overview)

**Type:** Interdimensional entities / Shining Children  
**Origin:** Astral Dimension / Created from dimensional debris  
**Era:** Present since the creation of dimensions

## Overview

**The Nine Outsiders** (also called "Shining Children" or "Elohim") are the most powerful and well-known of the Outsider entities. They are interdimensional beings born from the traumatic process of dimensional creation, when dark matter adheres to the brightest sparks of light and energy.

> [!NOTE] Terminology
> **Archon** is the default term for these entities. They are also called **Elohim**, **Outsiders**, and **Shining Children**—these terms are used interchangeably throughout the vault. All Archons believe in some form of keeping humans jailed, though they differ in their methods and philosophies.

Yahweh was the first of the Shining Children to coalesce, by quite a large margin. Before even another coalesced, It had already lived longer than any of the other Shining Children have today. While it had initially played a role in the rise of humanity, it afterward largely retired to the Radiant Realm.

## Key Outsiders

### Yahweh

The first and most powerful of the Shining Children. Also known as Atum (Egyptian). Identified with Jesus in Christian tradition: "I am in the Father and the Father is in me." Jesus was a human possessed by an outsider since birth, with the body engineered to better channel psionic powers.

- **PSIONICS:** 12 (24 PSI Points)

### Lucifer

Stands in opposition to YHWH's plans, leading a group of outsiders during the War in Heaven (which Lucifer lost, causing him to be banished from the Radiant Dimension). Also known as Set (Egyptian), Nergal (Mesopotamian), and Prometheus (Greek). The antichrist is a person who would be prepared from conception by Lucifer for it to inhabit, in the way YHWH prepared and inhabited Jesus.

## The Prison Dimension

The universe as humans experience it is a **prison dimension**. The Archons (Outsiders) are not conducting experiments—they are maintaining a prison. All Archons believe in some form of keeping humans jailed, though they differ in their methods and philosophies. They influence human history through possession, direct manifestation, and manipulation of human societies through groups like De Beweging to maintain control and prevent awakening.

## Historical Manifestations

The Outsiders have interjected in human history numerous times, through both physically manifesting in our dimension or by possessing human beings (and sometimes animals). Direct manifestations are told of in myth and legend. See [Historical Interventions](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim#Historical-Interventions.md) for detailed information.

### Key Historical Events

**Ancient Era:**
- **Prometheus and the Gift of Fire** - Lucifer granting humans primitive sentience, leading to the War in Heaven
- **The Watchers from the Book of Enoch** - Outsiders possessing human men who then mated with human women, creating the Nephilim
- **The Tower of Babel** - Deliberate division of humanity to prevent unified advancement
- **The Great Flood** - Multiple flood myths representing prison resets when the system became unstable
- **Sodom and Gomorrah** - Destruction of settlements that threatened Archon control

**Classical Era:**
- **The Oracle at Delphi** - Gabriel (Apollo) influencing human decision-making through possession
- **The Trojan War** - Multiple Outsiders intervening directly in human conflict
- **The Plagues of Egypt** - Yahweh demonstrating power and dominance over other Outsiders
- **The Exodus** - Continuous Outsider presence guiding and observing a chosen people

**Medieval and Renaissance:**
- **The Tengu** - People possessed by Outsiders for extended periods, accounting for mystical powers in Japanese folklore
- **The Black Death** - Archons maintaining control through fear and trauma
- **Joan of Arc** - Michael using a human agent in the Hundred Years' War
- **The Renaissance** - Selective release of knowledge to accelerate human development

**Modern Era:**
- **Social Credit Economic Theory** - Long-term system of control beginning in 1916 (see [Social Credit Party](./Factions/Social-Credit-Party.md))
- **World Wars** - Maintaining control through fear, trauma, and division
- **UFO Phenomena** - Beginning in the 1940s, using Greys to interact with humanity while maintaining secrecy
- **Modern Cults** - Groups like [Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md) serving as control mechanisms and recruitment pools

### Patterns of Intervention

Outsiders intervene through:
- **Direct Manifestation** - Physical appearance in our dimension
- **Possession** - Taking control of human bodies temporarily or permanently
- **Indirect Influence** - Dreams, visions, and subtle psychic manipulation
- **Proxy Agents** - Human cults and organizations (see [De Beweging](./Factions/De-Beweging.md))
- **Biological Constructs** - Using Greys and other created beings

Their goals include maintaining the prison, preventing awakening, reinforcing the Veil, controlling development, harvesting resources, and settling factional conflicts. Every intervention leaves traces: unexplained phenomena, psychological trauma, cultural shifts, and physical evidence—the scars of being prisoners in a cosmic jail.

## Relationship with Other Elements

- **Greys:** The Archons created the Greys as remote-controlled biological constructs
- **Nephilim:** Created when Archons possess humans during conception
- **Human History:** Archons have manipulated human development throughout history to maintain the prison
- **Religious Traditions:** Many gods and religious figures are actually Archon manifestations
- **De Beweging:** The Dutch cult serves Archon interests in maintaining control
- **Social Credit:** Economic theory used by Archons as a system of control

## In Play

The Nine Outsiders serve as:

- **Cosmic horror elements** - Entities beyond human comprehension who maintain a prison dimension
- **Mythological connections** - Links between ancient religions and modern encounters
- **Possession scenarios** - Characters may be possessed by Archon entities
- **Investigation targets** - Cases involving unexplained phenomena with Archon origins
- **Ultimate antagonists** - Powerful entities maintaining human imprisonment
- **Complex moral landscape** - Different factions with different methods, all ultimately serving the same goal

### Game Considerations

- The Archons are extremely powerful and should be used sparingly
- Their connection to mythology and religion adds depth to investigations
- The revelation that many gods are actually Archons creates profound implications
- Possession scenarios create opportunities for body horror and identity crisis
- Their traumatic origins and anger make them unpredictable and dangerous
- The War in Heaven and Lucifer's banishment provide historical context for conflicts
- The different factions create opportunities for complex moral choices—even "benevolent" Archons are still jailors
- The prison dimension concept adds existential horror to the setting
