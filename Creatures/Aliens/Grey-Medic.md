## Abilities

### Healing Powers

A Grey Medic has many ways to heal biological (and pseudo-biological) beings and it typically uses these as the performance of miracles to devout cultists. It can, in cases of prolonged combat, use these powers to heal other Greys if it is tactically useful.

### Alien Implant

One of the key tasks performed by medics is the implanting of tracking devices into human abductees. A Medic, typically assisted by a [[Creatures/Aliens/Grey-Harvester|Grey Harvester]], will implant these devices into both willing cultists and unwilling abductees.

### Psychic Scream

When this Grey is destroyed, it unleashes a psychic "howl"—a violent psychic backlash that tears open a rift to its masters' realm. All sentient beings within **10' range** are struck for psychic damage (see Psionic Damage table) with **+1 bonus to the roll**; armor offers no protection.

**Psychic Scream Ranges by Grey Type:**
- **Drone:** 5' range, no bonus to damage
- **Soldier:** 5' range, +1 to damage
- **Harvester:** 10' range, +1 to damage
- **Navigator:** 10' range, +2 to damage
- **Oracle:** 30' range, +2 to damage
- **Commander:** 30' range, +3 to damage

## In Play

Grey Medics serve as:

- **Medical operations** - Conducting examinations and procedures on abductees
- **Implant installation** - Placing tracking devices in humans
- **Healing** - Using psionic powers to heal injuries
- **Cult manipulation** - Performing "miracles" for cultists
- **Combat support** - Healing other Greys during combat

### Game Considerations

- Medics are non-combat specialists but can heal in combat
- The implant installation creates ongoing threats for abductees
- The healing powers can be used to manipulate cultists
- The psychic scream creates a dangerous death effect
- The connection to Harvesters suggests coordinated operations
