# Greys (The Visitors)

**Type:** Alien species / Biological constructs  
**Origin:** Claimed to be from Zeta Reticula III (actually Elohim constructs)  
**Era:** Active since 2500 B.C., increased activity since 1947

## Overview

The **Greys** (also called "The Visitors" or "The Others") are the most commonly encountered alien species in reports of abductions, UFO sightings, and paranormal phenomena. They appear as gray-skinned humanoids with large heads, oversized black eyes, and willowy limbs.

> [!Danger]- The Truth
> In truth, the Visitors are nothing more than remote-controlled biological constructs created by the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) to ensure their own secrecy and to ease the mental blow that contact with the Mi-Go could inflict upon the common human. Through these automatons, the Ethereals hope to study humans without revealing themselves.
> 
> A single Ethereal can control a number of Visitor automatons equal to its PSIONICS score. The range of this control is dependent on the mission. Certain Ethereal devices have lengthened the usual short range of this control to near-stellar distances for short periods.

## Physiology

This gray-skinned humanoid has long, willowy limbs and a bulbous head with oversized black eyes.

### Physical Characteristics

The Visitors are carbon-based lifeforms that are remarkably similar to humans in many ways. The average Visitor is four feet tall and weighs about ninety pounds. They have an enlarged cranium (within which the brain is a seamless pink organ), are hairless, thin-lipped, and have huge almond-shaped eyes which have no whites. Their hands have four long fingers tapering towards the pinky, which is the longest. Like humans, they have opposable thumbs. The Visitors' arms are long and gangly, but are otherwise identical to human anatomy. There are no apparent sex organs and internally, nothing identifiable as reproductive organs can be found.

### Photosynthesis

They are photosynthetic, and their digestive system has atrophied much like the human appendix. Instead of digesting food, their skin collects the energy they need through the reaction of sunlight on the chlorophylllike substance which composes their blood. This blood is pumped throughout the body by a large heart-like organ located in the chest. The liquid circulates into the skin, collects the sun's energy, delivers it to areas within the body, collects any waste from within the body, and then excretes any wastes through the skin. These waste products give the Greys their trademark "burning cardboard" odor.

Lack of sunlight for a short period (about eight hours) will cause the Grey to enter biological stasis (they use a form of "grow lights" in facilities that don't have access to natural light). This torpor incapacitates the Grey until it is once again exposed to sunlight. They can also enter a voluntary torpor in which they are immune to most harsh environments, and all biological activity ceases.

### Visitor Voices

The Greys have loud mechanical voices reminiscent of some sort of voice synthesizer. Every Grey sounds and acts alike and few have any understanding of the concept of the individual. When walking or talking, they often act in complete unison, moving in lockstep, or speaking the same exact sentences. Each Grey seems to know and have memories of anything any other Grey has seen or heard.

> [!Danger] The Truth
> The efficiency of their movements and their moments of deliberation owe to the fact that they are biological constructs being operated by Outsiders. As a single Outsider will usually control all members of a crew, there can be lag in the action of an individual Visitor as the Outsider focus shifts. As they are automaton, they do not need to communicate with each other, so it is not true to say they use telepathy.

## Psychology

Stories of encounters with these creatures often take the form of poorly remembered nightmares. Some abductees recall being brought aboard the Visitors' vast, otherworldly vessels and subjected to nightmarish experiments, while others have vivid but terrifying memories of being confined in cramped, dark places that are seemingly alive. In spite of the differences in their experiences, those who have encountered Visitors universally find their presence alien, condescending, and sinister.

Little is known about the Visitors' motivations. However, their goals appear to center around the search for information, rather than conquest. Victims of their abductions are almost always returned mostly unharmed. Theory wonders at the end goals of this accumulation of knowledge and what purposes the information gleaned may serve in the meantime. Two competing theories dominate the discussion:

- **Theory #1:** The Visitors are preparing for an eventual all-out invasion
- **Theory #2:** The Visitors are simply curious about us, but their alien mindsets lead them to sate this inquisitiveness in disturbing ways.

Visitors' movements and expressions are disturbing and inhuman, and their intentions remain inscrutable. Their movements are efficient, and they frequently spend several seconds in deliberation before each move they make. They seem to communicate with their own kind using only telepathy, forgoing even body language or eye contact.

## History

The Greys claim to be from the now-dead star of Zeta Reticula III in the M-31 star cluster. On a Mars-like desert planet orbiting this star, the Greys' parent race slowly developed an extensive and peaceful technological society which reached maturity shortly before the dinosaurs arose on Earth. The society was a utopia by Earthly standards: there was no food shortage, no ecological problems, and the race lived in a carefully checked harmony within the ecosystem of their world. When their eyes turned towards the stars and the settlement of nearby stellar objects, the race of Zeta Reticula III developed a caste of their own species suited for space travel. These are the Greys. Constructed for the long journeys necessary in space travel, the Greys were built to need little for survival. Their photosynthetic skin and lack of solid waste products made them extremely easy to maintain in space.

When space travel became a common and successful enterprise, the race of Zeta Reticula III (we'll call them the ZR) became worried about the propagation of their manufactured space caste. The Greys were limited through technological and biological means to prevent their reproduction without the help of the ZR. Eventually this plan left the race of Greys sterile.

Several "worldships" were constructed over huge spans of time to ferry portions of the ZR and Greys to other star systems. It was during this construction phase that a sudden catastrophe destroyed the star of Zeta Reticula III. It is thought some sort of huge object collided with the sun at near light speeds, causing a nova-like explosion. Only two of the worldships were near enough to completion to escape the onrushing wave of destruction and all the planets in the system, including the Greys' homeworld, were destroyed. Unfortunately, no members of the ZR race survived.

This supernova event occurred over 3 million years ago. Since that time, the two worldships set off in different directions, hoping to find a solution to their reproduction problem and a world suitable for settlement. The worldship which discovered Earth in 2500 B.C. has remained here ever since, in a deep orbit well beyond Pluto. The Visitors, who refer to themselves as "the Others," found the human race almost 95% genetically compatible with their own. Since 2500 B.C. the Visitors have tried in vain to develop technology which would allow them to rejuvenate their dying race using biological samples from Earth.

Up until 1947 the Greys had no problem hiding their presence from humanity, but with the advent of the second world war and the sudden development of new technologies, the Greys were for the first time worried about accidental discovery. An accident in 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico, forced their hand. It was clear that humanity would have to be apprised of the true situation when one of the Greys' craft was knocked out of the air during a severe thunderstorm. Unsure whether to make direct contact or not, the Greys devised a test which they believed would decide whether or not humanity was ready for first contact. From one of their many secret bases throughout the solar system, the Greys beamed a subtle encoded radio message at the Earth. If this message was detected and translated, the Greys theorized, it would mean that humanity was prepared for interaction with an alien species. The Greys, not wanting to seem like a hostile alien force, waited for humanity to hear their summons and answer properly before revealing themselves.

In Canada, the Shag Harbour UFO incident was a similar event.

The Greys' relationship with Majestic-12 has been beneficial to them and they enjoy interacting with humanity, although their methods and actions must remain secret indefinitely, to the general population of Earth. The Greys view humanity as their principal heirs, and hope that they can teach humanity the valuable lessons their ancient culture learned before the first human ever walked on the planet Earth. When the time comes, the Greys will put humanity in contact with the galactic culture from which they came.

## Language

The Visitor language is pictographic, with small symbols that often seem mathematic in nature. These symbols are commonly etched into objects and colored. Some religious symbols found on Earth are also found in the Visitor written language, including the ankh, the cross, and the all-seeing eye.

> [!Question]- The Truth
> Under close scrutiny this language proves to be little more than a hodge-podge of poorly executed ideas and simple grammatical rules. Analysis by will prove that the language is little more than fragmented "sentences" with almost no grammatical connections with phrases before or after. 
> 
> Sure enough, some have come to believe that the Visitors developed a hive mentality some time in the distant past which has led to the obsolescence of their ancient language, and that it is now inscribed for ceremonial purposes only. 

> [!Danger]- The Truth 
> In truth the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) do not want to give humanity a chance to examine their own written tongue, and so have botched together a simple pidgin for the purpose of confounding any investigation. The language is simple because it was constructed by beings who understand linear language poorly at best.

## Grey Types and Roles

**SKILL:** 5 (not very skillful in general, but high special skills?)  
**STAMINA:** 8

A Commander is a powerful alien individual who can single handedly perform all of the functions necessary to operate a flying disc and accomplish its mission. In addition, they are the most powerful form of Grey Psionicist.

### Grey Roles

- **Commander** - Leader and psionicist
- **Leader** - Command role
- **Technician** - Technical operations
- **Medic** - Medical and biological operations
- **Navigator** - Ship navigation
- **Soldier** - Combat operations
- **Terrorist** - Hostile operations

## Ships and Technology

Much like the grays themselves, their ships are designed less for offense and more for evading and subduing their targets, employing tractor beams and EMP weapons to disable and control a vessel, preserving its crew as test subjects. Such captives find themselves unable to move, held under brilliant lights, their captors' mere silhouettes as their thoughts and memories are sifted under the gray's psychic touch.

Once rare enough that reports of their abductions were written off as conspiracy and delusion, reports of encounters with the Visitors have become disturbingly more common. It is said their sleek, saucer-shaped ships prowl the night sky, appearing seemingly out of nowhere.

## In Play

Greys serve as the primary alien antagonists in M-EPIC investigations. They represent:

- **Abduction scenarios** - Players may investigate missing persons cases that lead to Grey abductions
- **UFO encounters** - Sightings and crashes that require investigation
- **Biological experiments** - Evidence of Grey genetic manipulation and hybrid programs
- **Cover-up operations** - Government and corporate efforts to hide Grey activities

### Game Considerations

- Greys are mysterious and inscrutable, making them perfect for X-Files-style investigation
- The revelation that they are Elohim constructs adds layers of cosmic horror
- Their photosynthetic nature and need for sunlight creates vulnerabilities players can exploit
- The connection to Men in Black and hybrid programs ties into broader conspiracy elements
