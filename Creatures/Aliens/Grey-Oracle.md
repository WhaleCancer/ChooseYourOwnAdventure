Oracles typically work alongside the Commander, providing:

- **Intelligence** - Information about targets, locations, and threats
- **Prediction** - Warning of potential dangers or opportunities
- **Targeting** - Locating specific individuals for abduction or other operations
- **Strategic planning** - Providing insights for mission planning

## In Play

Grey Oracles serve as:

- **Intelligence gathering** - Collecting information through psionic means
- **Prediction** - Warning of future events or threats
- **Target location** - Finding specific individuals for operations
- **Strategic support** - Providing insights for mission planning
- **Combat intelligence** - Perceiving threats and opportunities in combat

### Game Considerations

- Oracles are intelligence specialists, not combat-focused
- The prediction abilities create opportunities for dramatic reveals
- The remote sensing creates investigation challenges
- The connection to Commanders suggests high-level operations
- The enhanced psychic scream reflects their importance
