## Abilities

### Mental Pilot

These are the pilots of the flying saucers. A Navigator will typically have *Mental Pilot* active and be connected to the flying saucer it is assigned to. This psionic ability allows the Navigator to:

- **Control the craft** - Directly pilot the UFO through psionic connection
- **Interface with systems** - Operate all craft systems through mental connection
- **Enhanced performance** - Achieve flight characteristics impossible for normal pilots
- **Remote operation** - Potentially control craft from a distance

### Psychic Scream

When this Grey is destroyed, it unleashes a psychic "howl"—a violent psychic backlash that tears open a rift to its masters' realm. All sentient beings within **10' range** are struck for psychic damage (see Psionic Damage table) with **+2 bonus to the roll**; armor offers no protection.

**Psychic Scream Ranges by Grey Type:**
- **Drone:** 5' range, no bonus to damage
- **Soldier:** 5' range, +1 to damage
- **Harvester:** 10' range, +1 to damage
- **Navigator:** 10' range, +2 to damage
- **Oracle:** 30' range, +2 to damage
- **Commander:** 30' range, +3 to damage

## In Play
