# Tall Robotic Explorers

**Type:** Alien robots / Scout units  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

The **Tall Robotic Explorers** are not native to Earth, nor independent travelers. Rather, they serve as advanced scout units, engineered and dispatched by the enigmatic Greys—or, as some theorists suspect, by even more secretive alien masters who command the Greys. These robots are the perfect instruments for *deep reconnaissance* of planets deemed hazardous or unpredictable, including the **remote, wild frontiers of the Soviet Union**.

## Physical Description

Standing nearly **eight feet tall**, the Robotic Explorer towers over any human. Its entire form is constructed from **seamless metallic segments**, with a **gleaming brass or burnished steel finish** that reflects surrounding light in dull amber or chrome hues.

### Head

- The head is a **smooth, domed helmet**—oval or slightly elongated, with **no mouth, nose, or recognizable features**
- In the center, there's a **single horizontal slit**, often faintly illuminated or intermittently glowing blue or white
- Sometimes, three tiny, deep-set "eyes" glimmer within the visor, each emitting a steady, cold light
- Occasionally, a faint, mechanical hum can be heard when the head rotates with perfect precision

### Torso and Limbs

- The **torso** is broad and armored, separated into distinct metallic plates that flex slightly when the being moves
- Two **long, jointed arms** descend to almost knee-height, ending in five-fingered hands—each finger tipped with a bulbous sensor or a fine manipulator, rather than claws
- The **legs** are similarly long and slightly wider at the calves and feet, which are flat and spread for stability, sometimes equipped with small vents or articulated toes

### Movement

- The robotic explorer moves with **precise, smooth, gliding motions**, either walking stiffly or—more unnervingly—lifting a few centimeters off the ground to "float" silently
- Its joints emit a faint, hydraulic hiss or soft servomechanical whir under strain, but otherwise it is eerily quiet

### Details

- The outer surface shows no seams, logos, or emblems, only occasional geometric grooves carefully etched into the metal
- Occasionally, panels or apertures open with perfect symmetry, revealing blinking colored lights, delicate instruments, or projecting beams of light and energy

### Presence

- The entire being exudes an **alien coldness, absolutely devoid of warmth or empathy**
- Standing near it, one is struck by its **mechanical perfection** and the uncanny feeling that it **observes everything** with inhuman patience

### Optional Accessories

- Sometimes, a **small, metallic sphere** (about the size of a melon), hovers nearby. It follows the robot, matching its movements, lined with tiny lenses and antennae

## Characteristics

| Characteristic | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| SKILL         | 9     |
| STAMINA       | 16    |
| LUCK          | 10    |
| ATTACKS       | 1     |

## Special Abilities

### Mechanical Form

Immune to poison, disease, and mind-influencing spells or effects (such as *Fear* or *Confusion*).

### Paralyzing Ray

Once per combat, the Robotic Explorer can fire a ray of pale blue light from a lens in its head. The target must test their LUCK or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. A paralyzed character cannot attack or defend.

### Damage Resistance

Physical attacks that deal less than 3 points of damage in a single blow are ignored (armor plating).

### Emotionless Gaze

Anyone attacking a Robotic Explorer for the first time must Test for Luck or suffer a -1 penalty to SKILL for that attack, due to the being's unnerving, inhuman presence.

## Mission Parameters

### Deployment

The Explorers are deployed in regions flagged as inhospitable and sparsely populated—vast Siberian forests, the desolate steppes of Kazakhstan, the Arctic taiga, or Chernobyl's radioactive ruins. Alien intelligence agencies believe these areas to be "safe zones" for planetside operations—free from human interference.

### Primary Objectives

- **Collect geophysical and biological samples:** Soil, mineral, and plant studies
- **Scan for technological artifacts** or signs of ancient civilization
- **Monitor for energy or radiation anomalies**
- **Tag wild animal populations** for unknown reasons

## Why the USSR?

- The Soviet Union's vast, sparsely inhabited territories are **ideal playgrounds for alien exploration**
- Rugged, extreme climates and seemingly endless wildernesses set the perfect stage for unnoticed operations
- The Greys, or their masters, frequently **miscalculate humanity's presence**—not accounting for migratory herders, isolated scientists, or children lost from villages
- Thus, humans running afoul of a Tall Robotic Explorer is rare, but not impossible—and always leaves a lasting tale

## Interactions With Humans

- The Explorers, **trained only to avoid large concentrations of intelligent life**, are often shocked or confused at local encounters, and may react unpredictably (defensive paralysis rays, silent withdrawal, or simple observation)
- Humans who witness them often survive, but are left with fragmented, dreamlike memories—sometimes aided by psychic "screen memories" imposed by the robots or their alien controllers

## Adventure Hooks

- A small Siberian mining team vanishes after reporting a "gleaming giant" in the woods. Investigators must brave both the wild and whatever is still out there—robot, Grey, or something worse…
- Border guards discover strange metallic footprints and anomalous plant growth near a forbidden military zone—rumors swirl of alien activity, but is it observation or invasion?
- At an isolated research outpost, scientists begin seeing strange, spherical drones and glimpses of massive, metallic shapes moving between the trees. The players must survive, evade, or negotiate with the visitors before being discovered—or reported

## In Play

Tall Robotic Explorers serve as:

- **Scout encounters** - Advanced reconnaissance units
- **Remote area threats** - Encounters in wilderness or remote locations
- **Mechanical opponents** - Immune to many normal attacks
- **Investigation targets** - Evidence of alien robotic technology
- **Cosmic horror** - Emotionless, inhuman entities

### Game Considerations

- Tall Robotic Explorers are extremely dangerous opponents
- The mechanical form creates unique combat challenges
- The remote deployment creates opportunities for isolated encounters
- The connection to Greys adds conspiracy layers
- The emotionless nature creates psychological horror elements
