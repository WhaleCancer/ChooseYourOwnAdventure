# Grey Harvester

**Type:** Grey specialist / Emotional harvesting  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**Grey Harvesters** are specialized Greys responsible for the collection of powerful emotions from humans that are channeled back to the [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Archons]]. The Archons are emotional vampires who feed on this harvested energy. Grey Harvesters work in conjunction with the [[Phenomena/Frequency-Fences|Frequency Fence]] system—while the Fence provides continuous, passive harvesting from exposed populations, Harvesters conduct targeted, intensive emotional collection during abductions and terror missions. They are very effective in this role serving on flying saucers tasked with abduction missions and in large scale terror missions.

## Abilities

### Psionic Powers

Harvesters use several psionic abilities as part of their emotional harvesting operations:

- **[[Dominate]] (1 PSI per command)** - Makes abductions easy to execute or to control powerful threats in combat
- **[[Induce Fear]]** - Used as part of their strange agenda to harvest emotions; they typically use this on creatures they have immobilized with [[Restrain]]; this is the explanation for some people's experience of sleep paralysis
- **[[Mental Affliction]]** - When a target has been abducted, a Harvester may use this as part of the emotional or spiritual harvest
- **[[Restrain]]** - Used to immobilize targets before harvesting emotions

### Sleep Paralysis Connection

Grey Harvesters are also known as **Grey Controllers** or **Sleep Paralysis Demons**. The experience of sleep paralysis—where individuals are awake but unable to move, often with a sense of presence or pressure—is actually the result of Harvesters using their psionic abilities to immobilize and harvest emotions from sleeping victims.

### Psychic Scream

When this Grey is destroyed, it unleashes a psychic "howl"—a violent psychic backlash that tears open a rift to its masters' realm. All sentient beings within **10' range** are struck for psychic damage (see Psionic Damage table) with **+1 bonus to the roll**; armor offers no protection.

**Psychic Scream Ranges by Grey Type:**
- **Drone:** 5' range, no bonus to damage
- **Soldier:** 5' range, +1 to damage
- **Harvester:** 10' range, +1 to damage
- **Navigator:** 10' range, +2 to damage
- **Oracle:** 30' range, +2 to damage
- **Commander:** 30' range, +3 to damage
