## Description

It is somewhat alarming to note the number of supernatural
creatures, sent by various Deities, that can be found following
a particularly heroic adventurer. The Gods of Good send the
Suma to ease their path to glory. The Trickster Gods of Luck
and Chance set mischievous Genies in their path to tempt
them with wishes and false advice. And the nameless Gods
of Evil that the Demon Princes follow will dispatch the
perilous beings known as NANKA.
Like Genies and Suma, this magical creature has no material
form. When it wishes to appear to another being, it will
manifest as a vague humanoid formed from thick black
smoke in which a pair of dark eyes glint wickedly. Usually,
however, a Nanka will set up a trap to ensnare its victim and
bring his soul to its terrible masters. A favourite trap involves
the Nanka hiding inside a glass phial, which is left where its
prey is sure to find it. When the flask is unstoppered, the thing
will flow out as a cloud of smoke and envelop the adventurer.
It will then flow back into the phial, taking its unfortunate
prey with it, and replace the stopper by magic. Once it has
captured its victim, the Nanka will transport him to the
Magical Planes and deliver his soul for its masters to feed
upon. Only magical weapons can offer any defence against
the malevolent Nanka.
