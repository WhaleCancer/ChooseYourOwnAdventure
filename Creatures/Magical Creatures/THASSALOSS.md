## Description

THASSALOSS
               
    Minor        Major
 
 
Although they appear to be undead, the THASSALOSS,
or Death Colossus, is actually a type of magical guardian
similar to the many varieties of Golem. The instructions
given to a Thassaloss are limited to staying in one spot to
guard a door or treasure, and to attack anyone who enters,
except their master. Given the amount of bones needed to
create one, their master is usually evil, such as Count
Reiner Heydrich of the Mauristatian principality of
Mortvania. The Thassaloss is a four-armed humanoid
skeleton of yellowed bones, with glowing green eye-
sockets. Two of its arms wield a large black scythe. It is
important to note that the Thassaloss is not affected by
Undead-related spells and abilities, such as Ward or
Banish. However, any Thassaloss can be killed instantly
by an obscure Old World enchantment known as the
Shatter Spell, which will snap its spine in two. Similar to
Skeletons though, edged and sharp weapons only do 1
point of STAMINA damage to a Thassaloss; blunt and
smashing weapons do normal damage. There are two
kinds of Thassaloss and both are detailed further below.
The MINOR THASSALOSS, which, despite its name, is
still a very formidable adversary, and during combat can
shoot a green ray of freezing cold from its eye sockets
towards its victim. This happens every Attack Round
regardless of whether the creature wins the Attack Round
or not. For a Minor Thassaloss, roll one die every Attack
Round. On a roll of 1-3, the ray strikes its victim, who must
deduct 1 point of STAMINA. On a roll of 4-6, the victim
manages to dodge the ray.
The MAJOR THASSALOSS is often the most powerful
guardian of any prominent evil-doer. It is much larger in
size than the Minor Thassaloss, however, the bones used
to construct them both appear to be human-sized. During
combat the Major Thassaloss can shoot a green ray of
freezing cold from its eye sockets at its victim. This

happens every Attack Round regardless of whether or not
the creature wins the Attack Round or not. The strength
of this chilling attack depends on the type of Thassaloss.
For a Major Thassaloss, roll one die every Attack Round.
On a roll of 1-5, the ray strikes its victim who must deduct
1 point of STAMINA. On a roll of 6, the victim manages to
dodge the ray.
