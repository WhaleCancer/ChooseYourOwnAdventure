## Description

BRIMSTONE GOLEMS are powerful constructs created from volcanic rock and brimstone, animated by dark sorcery. They appear as hulking humanoid figures with a rough, rocky exterior that glows faintly with inner heat. The smell of sulphur and brimstone surrounds them, and their touch can cause burns. These golems are particularly dangerous in combat, capable of crushing opponents with their massive fists or hurling rocks with devastating force. Like all golems, they are deaf to all but the voice of their master and cannot speak, serving as relentless guardians and enforcers.
