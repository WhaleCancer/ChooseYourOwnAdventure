## Description

GOLEMS are magical humanoids animated by sorcerers to
serve them. Similar to Crystal Warriors, but far more flexible
in their uses, they make excellent guards or servants, for they
are strong, unsleeping and totally obedient. The creation of a
Golem requires powerful magic and a day-long ritual. Some
spell-casters have managed, however, to devise a spell that
allows them to create a Golem instantly from a large mass of
the appropriate material. By pointing a finger at a chair, for
example, and muttering a few lines, a sorcerer can transform
the object into a large wooden humanoid that will do his
every wish.
FLESH GOLEMS are animated from the dead bodies of
humans, typically sewn together to create an ugly, disjointed
figure almost three metres tall. Like all Golems, they are deaf
to all but the voice of their master or mistress, and cannot
speak. They attack with club-like fists, smashing their way
through armour and bones alike.
The strongest of the three types are STONE GOLEMS, large
powerful beings that are easily mistaken for statues when
stationary. They are created from a single block of stone,
which is normally carved to the desired shape before being
animated. Stone Golems are sometimes deliberately made
exactly like statues, so that they can discreetly guard certain
areas and catch intruders unawares. Others are made to look
more human and will usually be more active in the service of
their masters. They will attack with their large stone hands;
if they have been posing as a statue, they may also be carry-
ing a stone weapon. Their bodies are so hard that edged
weapons – swords, axes, spears and arrows – have no effect
on them at all. A crushing weapon such as a mace or war-
hammer will do normal damage to a Stone Golem.

WOOD GOLEMS do not have to be carved from one single
log, but all the wood must be from the same tree. Wood
Golems, once animated, are completely invulnerable to mag-
ic of all kinds; even a magical weapon will be no better than
an ordinary one. They are very vulnerable to fire, however,
which can turn them into a blazing torch in a few short
moments. Wood Golems attack with their hands, causing
normal damage.
