## Description

The BRONZE GOLEM appears as a statue of a giant, with magical symbols inscribed across its forehead. It is a formidable construct, capable of crushing opponents in its powerful grip. The Bronze Golem can "hug to death" its victims, and its body contains liquid fire blood that causes burns to anyone who damages it in combat.
