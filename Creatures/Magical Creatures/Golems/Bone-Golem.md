## Description

A BONE GOLEM is constructed from a normal human skeleton and additionally modified with a covering of overlapping, stony plates that form its armour. A dull green glow emanates from the eye sockets of its skull, and it holds a large, rune-inscribed sword in its bony hands. Any wound from the runesword inflicts 3 STAMINA points of damage per hit, with no Armour Roll allowed. The runesword is fused to the Bone Golem's hands, and thus difficult to remove successfully if the creature is defeated in combat.

To make matters worse, the enchanted nature of the Bone Golem allows its bones to knit back together and reanimate after it has been 'slain'; only an Explode spell, or some other way to destroy its individual bones will permanently finish it off. Bone Golems are used as guardians and sentinels, and when created can be given a simple set of instructions to follow, such as 'Stand here and attack all who attempt to enter the brown crystal door,' as was the case with the one that guarded the necromancer Caltarelair's lair.
