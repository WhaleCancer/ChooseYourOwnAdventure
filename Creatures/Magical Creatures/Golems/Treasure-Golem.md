## Description

Similar to the Sand Golem, the TREASURE GOLEM

does not have a permanent form but rather is the

result of a powerful enchantment placed on a hoard

of gold and jewels. Should an intruder disturb the

riches, they will instantly animate with a sound like

pebbles being tumbled upon a beach, taking on

humanoid form and striding forth to deal with the

would-be thief. The Treasure Golem will a;ack

with fists of gold coins, staring at its victim

impassively with eyes of pearl or whatever other

baubles and jewels are present. The cursed hoard of

the pirate Blackscar, rumoured to be somewhere on

Bone Island, was guarded by such a creature.

Should it defeat a treasure-hunter it would simply

revert back to a pile of gold coins and jewels, and

this was often, as Treasure Golems are immune to

non-magical weapons. Also, a magical pointed or

bladed weapon, such as a spear or sword, will only

do 1 STAMINA point of damage to the creature’s
