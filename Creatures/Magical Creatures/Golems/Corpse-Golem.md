## Description

Unlike other Golems and their tendency towards being reactive static guardians, the CORPSE GOLEM is an active hunter of people! Used only by the most evil and depraved of mighty villains, such as the ancient Vampire Lord, Count Reiner Heydrich, it resembles a hulking man-like figure, cobbled and stitched together from sundry bits of various human (and otherwise) bodies, leaving one with a grotesque patchwork creature that reeks of death and decay. The Corpse Golem moves with an unnatural, jerky gait, its mismatched limbs working in disturbing harmony as it pursues its targets relentlessly. It wields a huge club with devastating force, and its undead nature makes it particularly difficult to destroy permanently.
