## Description

CLAY GOLEMS are magical constructs formed from clay and earth, animated through sorcerous rituals. They appear as roughly humanoid figures with a soft, malleable appearance, though their bodies harden when struck. These golems are more flexible than stone golems but less durable, making them suitable for tasks requiring some dexterity. They attack with their clay fists or wield simple weapons like mallets. Like all golems, they are completely obedient to their creator and cannot speak or hear anything but their master's commands.
