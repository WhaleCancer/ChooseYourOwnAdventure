## Description

DEMON BATS usually live on the Magical Plane of Fire, a
supernatural realm which they share with Fire Elementals,
Imps and Sprites. Sometimes, however, they are summoned
to the Earthly Plane, by way of a lengthy arcane ritual, to serve
warlocks and sorcerers as guards and assassins.
They appear as ghostly, ethereal bats, whose bodies and
wings scintillate with wisps of flame. They can communicate
with one another using high-pitched shrieks and squeals, but
are also intelligent enough to understand their summoner's
wishes, provided he stays within his protective pentagram!
Demon Bats are wilful, vicious creatures, and require careful
handling: only the most skilled of spell-casters can deal with
them.

In an attack, Demon Bats will usually try to clasp their
opponent with their claws, and deliver a massive blast of fire
from their bodies. If they hit him successfully twice in a row,
their next successful strike will deliver an extra 5 points of
damage. Similarly, if a Demon Bat is killed while on this
Earthly Plane, it will expire in a burst of flame (which will
deliver a further 4 points of damage to anyone within three
metres of it - Test for Luck to avoid), before its spirit returns
to the Magical Plane to be reborn.
