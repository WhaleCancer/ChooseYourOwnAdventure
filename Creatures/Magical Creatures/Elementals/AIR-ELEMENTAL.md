## Description

The force of a raging AIR ELEMENTAL is enough to tear the
roof off a palace, flatten a whole village, or lift a man and
throw him many metres into the air. When one is sum-
moned, it appears as a whirlwind of air, spinning and danc-
ing at high speed. The air around the creature howls as the
raging wind sucks up rocks, stones and other small items,
and spits them out into the air.
Like all Elementals, they can only be hit by enchanted weap-
ons. Trying to stand up to an angry Air Elemental, however,
requires great strength. Should anyone try to withstand the
raging blast, he must Test for Luck. If unsuccessful, he will
be knocked flying, and lose 1 SKILL point and a die of
STAMINA damage. If he maintains his footing with a suc-
cessful throw, he will still lose 2 STAMINA points, but will
be able to keep standing long enough to attempt two strikes,
before having to Test for Luck again. Air Elementals are
immensely strong and can rarely be killed. Worse still, when
they die, their spirits simply return to their home plane to
recuperate and heal. A banished Air Elemental cannot be
recalled to earth for sixty-six days.
