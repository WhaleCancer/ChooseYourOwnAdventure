## Description

WATER ELEMENTALS are only ever encountered at sea;
like all such beings, they cannot survive away from their
native environment. They can be very dangerous to men and
boats alike. Water Elementals are rarely summoned to this
plane, and are consequently encountered very infrequently;
some do dwell in the seas and oceans of the world, manifest-
ing in a roughly humanoid form in the hearts of whirlpools
and typhoons. Because of their liquid nature, they cannot be
damaged by weapons at all – blades and missiles pass
straight through! They are destructive beings, but prefer to
smash boats and leave their occupants to drown in the swirl-
ing eddies of a whirlpool. Legend speaks of a particularly
fortunate adventurer who apparently managed to trap a

ELF
ELVES walked the lands while humans still lived in caves
and trees, for they are a very ancient race. These tall human-
oids live about twice as long as humans, whom they tend to
look down on as children. All Elves are thin beings, with
large ears and slanting eyes. They seem more graceful than
humans, and far more intelligent somehow. They are fearless
warriors, particularly expert with longbows. There are a
number of different Elven races, each sharing a common
heritage, but very different from the others.
