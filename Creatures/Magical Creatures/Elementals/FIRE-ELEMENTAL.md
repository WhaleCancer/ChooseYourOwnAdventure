## Description

FIRE ELEMENTALS are the most common of all these mag-
ical creatures. They are also the smallest and weakest of the
four types, and are summoned and controlled more easily.
Fire Elementals typically appear as vaguely humanoid fig-
ures, as tall as a man, composed solely of flames. They are far
more intelligent than their fellow beings, and are more will-
ing to be summoned to Earth, where they can add to their
knowledge.
These beings can, as usual, only be hit by magical weapons.
The heat of their flames will melt most things, even metals,
which makes combat extremely difficult. After two success-
ful strikes on a Fire Elemental, even an enchanted blade will
be ruined. They are so hot that water thrown over them will
immediately evaporate. When faced with an angry Fire Ele-
mental, it is very important to know the command word to
banish the creature home, from where it cannot be sum-
moned for forty days.
