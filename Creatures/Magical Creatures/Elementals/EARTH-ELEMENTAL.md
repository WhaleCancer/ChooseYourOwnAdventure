## Description

EARTH ELEMENTALS are the strongest and most evil of all
the Elementals. They are very hard to summon and control,
so they are rarely found on the Earthly Plane in the service of
a wizard. Should they be encountered at all, it will usually be
deep underground or high among the rocky peaks of the
mountains. They appear as massive stone humanoids, cov-
ered with rocky hides. It is said that in the old days extreme-
ly adept sorcerers managed to imprison some Earth
Elementals inside large masses of rock, to stop them causing
earthquakes and landslides, and generally wreaking havoc
around the countryside.
Freeing an Earth Elemental is extremely stupid, and will lose
the fool who does so one die of LUCK points. Actually
attempting to fight an Earth Elemental is more foolish still:
such a fight is virtually impossible to win! Their prodigious
strength is legendary; their blows will do 4 points of damage.
Worse still, the creatures can only be damaged with magical
weapons, and their tough skins reduce any injury against
them to only 1 point. Should an Earth Elemental actually be
killed, its spirit will return to its home plane, and can never
be summoned again.
