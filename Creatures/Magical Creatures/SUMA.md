## Description

The SUMA are a race of generally friendly and helpful spir-
its, related to the more mischievous Genies. Like the latter,
they live on the various Magical Planes, basking in the warm
ether streams that flow in such areas. Occasionally, however,
they are sent to the Earthly Plane to watch over and care for
adventurers favoured by the Gods, their patrons, and help
them in their fight against Evil.
Much of the aid a Suma will give to its ward is done in secret,
so the adventurer is unaware of its presence. They can turn
invisible at will, and will help the adventurer by making
swords break, monsters slip over, arrows miss and so on. All
this will simply make the adventurer think he is particularly
lucky: part of a Suma's task is to make sure its aid is not
noticed. Sometimes, however, an adventurer will get himself
into such dire straits that the Suma is forced to materialize to
help him out. A typical manifestation is in the form of a
glowing, golden human, sometimes found, Genie-like, in-
side an object such as a lantern.
In these extremely rare encounters, Suma will usually offer
verbal advice. They can tell the adventurer how to escape his
present situation, though they cannot help him physically.
They will never dole out the traditional 'three wishes'; such
an abuse of power is left to the more Chaotic Genies, as it can
radically alter Fate, which is something a servant of Good
will not attempt. The advice and aid of a Suma can some-
times be rather obscure for this reason, and may infuriate an
adventurer if he doesn't understand it. Attempting to attack

Suma is pointless, however, for they have no physical form:
they will simply blink out of existence and reappear some-
where else. They are well versed in the eccentricities of
adventurers, and will be patient with them. They are well
aware that the Gods of Good cannot act directly against the
minions of Evil on Earth, and have to rely on the help of
heroic adventurers in doing their work for them, with just a
little guidance delivered by the Suma.
