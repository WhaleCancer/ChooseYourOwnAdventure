## Description

Similar to Devlins, FIRE SPRITES are tiny elemental crea-
tures, normally found on the Plane of Fire. They can be
summoned to earth, though, by powerful magic, to fight for
their summoner. On this plane they appear to be small,
vaguely human-shaped beings, composed entirely of flames.
They attack by scorching their opponent; their touch is so hot
that it does 3 points of damage instead of the normal 2.

Anything flammable bursts into flames at their touch. Dous-
ing them with water seems actually to make them larger and
stronger, feeding the flames rather than extinguishing them.
However, smothering them in a heavy cloak or rug will cut
off their air, and they will go out, banished back to their
home plane in an instant. Fire Sprites are no relation to the
tiny earthly Sprites.
