## Description

The DARKTHORN is an evil counterpart to Galana,

Goddess of Plants; an ancient elemental spirit allied

to the Dark Lords, who seeks to destroy the forests

of Titan and replace them with endless thickets of

brambles, thorns and briars. Worshipped by chaos

cults and

renegade druids,

it is

the physical

manifestation of the Root of Evil, and can be

summoned to

Titan by

a powerful

priest or

priestess. The last time this was known to happen

was in Ruddlestone, when the Arch-Cleric Bryar

led the Clerics of Lein in allying with the Dread

Lord Belgaroth, until slain by Evrain Peredur, a

Templar Knight of Telak.
