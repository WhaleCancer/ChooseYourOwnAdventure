## Description

One of the hindrances a warlock faces in pursuing his chosen
craft is the amount of time spent in tedious rituals and
frustrating research, and the corresponding lack of time
available for learning the arts of the warrior. Consequently,
many wizards are very weak and prone to all kinds of attack.
To counter this, a number of defences have been invented;
one is the CRYSTAL WARRIOR.
A sorcerer first takes a large block of pure quartz and fashions
it into human form with a specially treated hammer and
chisel. The statue is then temporarily animated by a lengthy
ritual, which bears many similarities to that used in the
creation of a Golem. The resulting Crystal Warrior is then set
to work, patrolling the passages and chambers of the wizard's
stronghold. It can memorize the faces of two people, or
remember a particular symbol; these people, or anyone
bearing the symbol, will be allowed to pass. All others will
be challenged and then engaged in combat. A Crystal Warrior
cannot be harmed by edged weapons; an opponent must use
a large blunt weapon, such as a war-hammer, or be pulverized
by its crushing blows.
