## Description

FETCH are strange, magical creatures that are found only
rarely, in deserted, out-of-the-way places, particularly
around sources of great magic. It is thought they are primi-
tive relatives of Will-o'the-Wisps, though it has been hard to
prove this. A Fetch typically appears as a small, scintillating
ball of energy, crackling with static and discharging small
bolts of lightning into the air. At the heart of the creature is
an intensely glowing area, in which electrical emissions are
frequent enough to generate intelligence.
Fetch live off magical energy, and will feed ravenously
whenever they can. A Fetch which has not eaten for a week
or so will be small and pale; one which has just feasted will
be almost a metre across, and very volatile, spitting static in
great arcs around itself. A Fetch will attack anyone carrying
magical weapons (to suck the items dry), or a particularly
heroic adventurer whose aura of luck is tangible enough to
feed on! Should they encounter a spell-caster, however, they
will deliberately provoke him into casting 'food' at them in
the form of spells, by flitting close and attacking in a stinging
flash, before nipping away again. Spells flung at a Fetch do
it no harm; instead, they will attract more of the creatures,
which can scent magical energy from a great distance away.
Fetch are slowed in extreme cold, however, and ice-produc-
ing spells will hurt them, and not be eaten. If a metal weapon
is used against one in a successful strike, both the wielder
and the Fetch will take damage as the creature shorts out! A
Dispel Magic spell or charm will destroy one immediately,
making it pop out of existence in a small, violent flash.
