## Description

Malevolent Chaotic spirits can be found lurking in many
dangerous parts of the underworld, waiting to trap any prey
that might stumble into their domain. One of the most bizarre
of all these beings is the CHANGELING, which can turn its
form into that of another, more powerful being at will.

Its natural form is that of a tiny human baby, ideal for enticing
its prey nearer, until it can strike. When first encountered, it
will be lying in a cradle, crying its eyes out. If comforted the
infant will appear to calm down and begin cooing to itself.
As soon as it can, though, the creature will change its shape
and attack. Its new form can be determined by rolling two
dice on the following table:
Dice Roll           Form
SKILL          STAMINA         Attacks

HillGiant

Werewolf

Cyclops

Nandibear

Doragar

Goblin

Ghoul

Minotaur

Cave Troll

Brain Slayer

Fire Demon
The beast will be exactly like its real counterpart, but it will
not have any of its special features (a Ghoul's touch will not
be poisonous, a Fire Demon can be hit by normal weapons,
and so on). When the creature's STAMINA has been reduced
to 4 points, the Changeling will take on another form, rolled
again on the table. And when this second creature has been
reduced to 4 STAMINA points, it will change again into its
final form, indicated by a further roll on the table. This last
form can be killed, the Changeling reverting to its normal
form when it dies - a tiny, innocent baby.
