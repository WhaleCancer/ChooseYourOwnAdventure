## Description

Men  have  always  dabbled  in  things  they  don't  fully
understand.   BOULDER BEASTS are  thought  to be the result
of the ignorant meddling of a foolish elementalist. In trying
to summon a major Earth Elemental from another plane to
become his slave, he unwittingly also released a group of evil
Earth Spirits, which were trapped here, unable to return.
The   spirits   inhabit   large   boulders,   which   they   slowly
propel   around   their   rocky   domains   on   short,   stubby
legs,  their   wide   toes   well   suited   to   the   rough ground.

They feed, rather cannibalistically, on clumps of stone, which
they tear away from larger outcrops with their huge stone
fists. They will also use their hands in attacking any creature
that disturbs them. Their rocky bodies will prove rather tough
for swords, which will only deliver a single point of damage
in a successful hit. A crushing weapon such as a mace or
war-hammer will prove more deadly to a Boulder Beast, and
will smash 3 points off the thing with every blow that connects.
When a Boulder Beast dies, its spirit will finally be released
to return to its home plane, free at last.
