## Description

MIST VAMPIRE is the name given in the tales of the marsh
people to a strange, ghostly creature said to dwell deep in the
inaccessible reaches of the marsh. Related to Will-o'-the-
Wisps, it usually appears amid the shifting mists and fogs of
its home as a pale, vaguely man-shaped spirit, wavering like
a spectre over the rushes.
It is highly intelligent and has many ingenious tactics for
ensnaring its prey. It lives on the life-forces of any creatures
it can catch, chilling them by swathing them in its arms, before
sucking their souls from their bodies with wispy fingers. It
usually feeds off frogs, lizards and marsh birds, wafting over
them and freezing them before they know they are dead.
Sometimes, however, it gets to feast on larger, more satisfying
sustenance, such as a man.
Its favourite lure is to leave a conspicuous item of treasure or
equipment, the remains of some previous victim, in a
prominent position on the pathway some distance ahead of
an approaching victim. When he arrives at the spot, the Mist
Vampire moans and calls for help a little way off, from among
the mists. It will lead its victim out into the marsh until he is
lost, and then attack. The creature can only be hit by magical
weapons; others pass straight through its ghostly body! On
a successful hit, instead of inflicting the usual damage, it will
remove 1 point of SKIL L. from its opponent with its chilling
touch. Should the victim's SKILL reach 0, he will die. The Mist
Vampire will take the last dregs of his soul, and allow his
drained, lifeless body to sink slowly down into the marsh...
