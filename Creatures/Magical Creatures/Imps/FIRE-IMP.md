## Description

FIRE IMPS are small, malicious elemental creatures from the Plane of Fire, typically summoned by wizards and sorcerers to serve as familiars or minor servants. They appear as small, roughly humanoid figures composed of living flame, with glowing red eyes and sharp, fiery claws. Unlike their larger elemental cousins, Fire Imps are more intelligent and can understand complex commands, though they are often mischievous and may interpret orders in ways that cause trouble for their masters.

Fire Imps attack with their fiery breath, which they can project as a stream of flames. They are commonly found in the company of spellcasters, serving as guards, messengers, or assistants in magical rituals. In towns and dungeons, they may be encountered either with their masters or in small groups if they have been set loose or abandoned. Their small size and agility make them difficult to hit, but they are relatively fragile creatures that can be banished back to their home plane if properly countered.
