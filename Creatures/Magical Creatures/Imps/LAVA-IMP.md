## Description

LAVA IMPS are primitive, bestial creatures native to the Plane of Fire, particularly found near volcanic regions and areas of intense heat. Unlike Fire Imps, which are more intelligent and serve as familiars, Lava Imps are wild, aggressive creatures with low intelligence and a feral nature. They appear as small, roughly dog-like or impish creatures with bodies that seem to be made of molten rock and lava, constantly dripping and glowing with inner heat.

These creatures are typically encountered in volcanic areas, deep dungeons with geothermal activity, or when accidentally summoned from their home plane. They attack with sharp, molten teeth that can cause burns in addition to physical damage. Lava Imps are hostile to all non-elemental creatures and will attack on sight, often appearing in small groups. They are less intelligent than Fire Imps and cannot be easily controlled or commanded, making them dangerous nuisances rather than useful servants.
