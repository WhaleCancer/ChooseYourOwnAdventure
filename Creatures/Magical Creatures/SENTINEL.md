## Description

There are many methods employed by wizards and noble-
men to protect their vast treasure-hoards, including Golems,
Crystal Warriors and SENTINELS. First created by a sorcerer
in the service of Baron Kognoy of Kaypong, a province to the
east of Fang, they are powerful, near-invisible guardians,
though unlike many are quite easy for their master to con-
trol. They are created by pouring a specially formulated
magical potion over a piece of gem or metal, in order to
create a Sentinel of the same basic material. The potion-cov-
ered item, typically a Gold Piece or a small diamond, will
retain its form until touched by human flesh. When creating
a Sentinel, it is very advisable to wear gloves!
The potion-drenched object is usually secreted near the top
of the treasure it protects, where it will hopefully be picked
up by a thief. Once touched by human hands, it will immedi-
ately transform into a large, fearsome warrior. The Sentinel
cannot be harmed by blows from normal weapons, unless its
opponent is in contact with a piece of the material from
which it was formed. Thus, to damage a Gold Sentinel its
opponent must be holding a Gold Piece, or some other gold-
en item. Should it be defeated, a Sentinel will instantaneous-
ly change back into its original form.
