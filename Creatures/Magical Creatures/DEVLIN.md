## Description

On the Magical Plane of Fire there are many spirit creatures
that can be summoned to the Earthly Plane to serve a clever
sorcerer. The DEVLINS are one such race, related to the larger
Fire Elementals and the smaller Fire Sprites. They appear as
roughly humanoid beings, as tall as a Dwarf, but made up of

a myriad tongues of fire. Their summoning can be long and
complicated, for an unprotected warlock can easily fall victim
to the creatures. Some, however, have found a way of creating
a partial ritual, which needs only one simple action - such as
the speaking of a command or the tossing of dust on a fire-
to bring a Devlin hastening to this plane to do their will.
Devlins can be very frightening and dangerous creatures,
since they cannot be harmed by earthly weapons, but they
can singe away 2 points of damage if they win an attack. The
only sure way of banishing a Devlin is to douse it with liquid
and extinguish it completely. Such an action will require a
large container of water or another liquid, and a Test for Luck.
If the throw is successful, there will be a short stifled scream
as the water douses the fire, and the spirit of the Devlin will
be sent back to the Magical Plane of Fire in extreme agony.
