## Description

LIGHTNING CREATURES are powerful beings

that dwell only at the storm-lashed tops of the

highest mountains of Titan or on the Elemental

Plane of Air. Made up of pure elemental energy,

they assume a vaguely humanoid shape for most of

the time, though they can transform themselves

into other shapes if need be. They are related to Air

Elementals, it is thought and are occasionally found

in their company. Storm Giants sometimes use

them as guardians of their cloud-based citadels, but

Lightning Creatures are most commonly found on

their own.
