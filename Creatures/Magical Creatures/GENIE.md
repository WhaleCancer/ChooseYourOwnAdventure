## Description

GENIES are magical creatures who can pop up in the most
unlikely places to help or hinder a frustrated adventurer.
They seem very Chaotic beings, but in truth they serve the
Trickster Gods of Luck and Chance. These mysterious Dei-
ties delight in manipulating the aims of both Good and Evil
for their own amusement. If Evil looks as though it is win-
ning at something, they will try to influence events so that
Good starts to gain the upper hand, and vice versa.

To affect events like this they use the Genies. These beings
usually dwell on the Magical Planes in spirit form. When
they are sent to the Earthly Plane they will assume a more
substantial shape, typically that of a wispy humanoid, fat
and bald, who will float in the air as if levitating. The help a
Genie offers can be most infuriating at times, but at others it
can be very helpful. They may divert enemies, turn an ad-
venturer invisible, or even offer him a free wish! Such aid is
rarely completely to the benefit of the adventurer; wishes,
especially, tend to be twisted and taken so literally that they
are more trouble to their user than they are worth. Such
behaviour makes some people dislike Genies intensely. Any-
one trying to attack a Genie will be in for a shock, though, for
weapons will pass straight through their bodies without
harming them. In return, a Genie might decide to teach such
an ungrateful person a lesson that will ensure he is more
polite to the servants of Fate in the future!
