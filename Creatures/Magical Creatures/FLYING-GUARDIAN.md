## Description

Some very peculiar beings have been left to stand guard over
sacred places. In the northern province of Chiang Mai, it is
traditional to leave a pair of FLYING GUARDIANS to watch
over a tomb or temple. They appear, to all intents and pur-
poses, to be statues in the form of large, ostrich-like birds
with hooked beaks, stubby wings and wide, clawed feet.
They will remain perfectly rigid, keeping their silent vigil
until the treasure or crypt is disturbed by a would-be thief or
grave-robber. Then the Guardians will come to life, take to
the air with strangely stilted, jerky movements, and attack
with beaks and claws. They may also try to warn other
denizens of the tomb, if there are any, by croaking loudly like
a crow. When they have dealt with the defilers of their sacred
home, they will return to their positions and stiffen into
statues to continue their silent watch.
