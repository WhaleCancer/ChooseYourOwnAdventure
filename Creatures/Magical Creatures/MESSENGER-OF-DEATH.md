## Description

When one is in need of an assassin, there are many highly
trained men available for hire. But when one has a
particularly skilled or stubborn enemy to eliminate, only a
MESSENGER OF DEATH will do. These fell creatures can be
summoned from one of the Demonic Planes by a secret ritual
to kill powerful opponents, taking as payment the life-force
of their victim.
They appear as Zombie-like humans, dressed in ragged
shrouds, their eyes and mouth full of mucus which makes
their voice little more than a sickly gurgle. They silently
approach their victim, tap lightly on one shoulder, murmur
'Death!' in a most dramatic manner, and then slink away to
lay out the traps for the game which will follow. The
Messenger will stay ahead of its victim, leaving letters marked
in prominent places – painted on doors, chipped into stone
and so on. If all the letters are read, they will spell the word
'Death', and the Messenger will reappear to watch the life
drain out of its helpless prey.
Messengers can only be harmed at the very moment the
'contract' is finalized, when the word is first spoken. As the
vile creature touches its victim to seal it, its guard is dropped,
and a silver dagger will banish the Messenger back to the
Demonic plane and negate the contract.

MIK
There is probably less known about the strange race of Elf-like
humanoids called MIKS than any other beings. They are very
rare, appearing without warning in a group of perhaps two
or three, before departing again as if they had never been
there. Worse, Miks are masters of illusion, able to transform
themselves into any shape or form they desire. As a result,
few have seen them as they really are –pale, emaciated
humanoids with large, intelligent heads.
A Mik's mastery of illusion is astounding. If it is disguised as
a venomous snake, for example, and bites someone, he will
die from the bite! They cannot, for some reason, simulate or
use metal in their disguises, however, and their illusions
cannot be cast over other objects or beings. They are a highly
mischievous and aggressive race, and delight in playfully
killing anyone they meet. They love gold, though, and can
sometimes be bribed into letting someone go free. If
threatened with violence, they will respond with their
favourite weapon, a needle-knife (a thin stiletto-like dagger),
or just turn into a bird and fly away!
