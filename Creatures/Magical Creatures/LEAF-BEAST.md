## Description

Despite his mean reputation, Lord Azzur, the ruler of Port
Blacksand, has one passionate love: exotic flowers, which he
exhibits in the public gardens. Pride of place in his collection
is given to a small crop of the legendary Black Lotus plants.
The rarity of these plants is such that the nobleman uses
magical guardians to prevent them from being stolen.
Around the bowl containing the flowers stand three bushes,
expertly trimmed to look like large animals. Should anyone
touch a Black Lotus, the three LEAF BEASTS – lion, tiger and
leopard – will spring to life and attack ferociously! A single
opponent will be able to match his Attack Strength with all
three, but he can injure only one of them at a time. If a hit is
indicated on the other two, he has simply held off their
attack. When they have dealt with the would-be flower-pick-
er, the beasts will spring back on to their pedestals and turn
back into bushes.
