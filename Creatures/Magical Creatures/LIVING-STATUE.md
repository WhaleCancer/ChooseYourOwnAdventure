Similar to Golems, LIVING STATUES are animated
effigies carved from stone or made from bronze, brass or
even crystal. However, whereas Golems are painstakingly
constructed automatons that are always in a sense “alive”,
Living Statues are usually completely inert until activated
by a specific set of actions or instructions. Several different
examples of Living Statues are given below, although it
should be noted that all of them only suffer 1 STAMINA
point of damage per blow from edged or pointed
weapons, such as swords and spears. Crushing and
smashing weapons like maces, clubs and warhammers,
are obviously much more effective and cause damage as
normal.
LESSER LIVING STATUES are the smallest and weakest,
and usually set to guard a tomb or vault and the treasure
it contains. Should an unfortunate tomb-robber attempt
to steal the valuables, the statue will animate and attack
until either it or the intruder is dead. The appearance and
weapons of these Living Statues varies widely, depending
on where they are found. In the ruins of ancient Djarat for
example, they are usually placed in pairs alongside the
entrance portal to a crypt, and carved as men bearing stone
spears. However, in northern Allansia, in the lands that
border the River Kok, there was once a fashion for rich
noblemen to be buried with a Crystal Statue that would
defend its lord’s wealth with only its flint-like fists. More
worryingly, some sorcerers, such as Grimslade of
Fenmarge, have even perfected spells to instantly animate
strategically placed Goblin Statues to deal with any
unwanted guests.
GREATER LIVING STATUES are far more impressive
beings, being carved from solid blocks of rock or thick
plates of bronze, and often three or four metres tall. As
befits their increased stature, they are usually placed
somewhere important, guarding a sacred shrine or
priceless artefact and pummelling any would-be looters
with their mighty fists. One such example is a great stone
Statue that stands in a mausoleum in the sunken ruins of
Atlantis, wearing a jade circlet upon its brow that some
claim is the mystical Crown of Atlantis. Another is a
massive Bronze Statue that guards its own offering bowl
outside the Gambling Halls of Vlada in the city-port of
Kharé. Both of these have special abilities; the Atlantean
Statue can talk, Curse its victim (who must deduct 2 points
from their LUCK score), or even detach and hurl its head
like a boulder, whereas the Bronze Statue is invulnerable
to all weapons unless struck at a certain weak point
somewhere on its left leg!
Stranger still are the magical IDOLS of distant eastern
lands such as Shabak and the city-states of the Glimmering
Sea. These are the enchanted effigies of actual gods and
goddesses, and usually take pride of place in a great
temple or worship-hall. Such deities are different versions
or aspects of more familiar gods venerated elsewhere; for
example Tanit, Goddess of Envy, is depicted as a six-
armed woman in robes of decorative silk, with a brass

lamp in one hand and curved scimitars in each of its other
hands. Idols are nowhere near as massive as Greater
Living Statues, but instead are ensorcelled to be immune
to all non-magical weapons. Normal weapons will merely
bounce off their finely-wrought frame, allowing the Idol
to quickly dispose of whatever thieves have disturbed it.
Rumour tells of such an idol bought by Baron Sukumvit
from corrupt priests of Bakulan, and interred deep within
the second incarnation of his devious Deathtrap Dungeon.

As most scholars know, the majority
of Lizard Men on Titan are subjects
of the mighty empire of Silur Cha that
spans the southlands of Allansia.
Those few Lizard Men who live
beyond the empire’s borders are
either mercenaries and freebooters or
they belong to several rare sub-races,
two of which are found on the Dark
Continent of Khul.
The most common of these are the
DESERT LIZARD MEN of the
Scythera Desert and the surrounding
badlands. They are similar to their
Allansian brethren in being large
humanoids with scaly skin and a
lizard’s head and tail, though there is
some regional variation in their
appearance. Those in the north have
green scales, with horned heads and
a spiked back, while those in the
south are blue-scaled, with no horns or spikes, and, as
such, more similar in appearance to the Lizard Kings. This
mix of characteristics is especially interesting given there
are no two-headed or mutant Desert Lizard Men,
suggesting the race could be an unthinkable hybrid of
normal Lizard Men and their Lizard King overlords!
Indeed, Desert Lizard Men lack any form of central
authority, and instead nomadically wander the wastes of
central Khul, in small trading convoys of one to six
creatures, each mounted on a Gunderwal and laden with
trade goods. These caravans travel great distances,
ranging from Tak and Calah in the south, to Shakuru in
the west, and all the way to Ashkyos and Kalagar in the
north! Sometimes several caravans will band together and
pitch camp at an oasis among the dunes, creating a
temporary village of three to eighteen Desert Lizard Men.
To defend themselves and their goods they use longbows
(with foot-long arrows), scimitars and spears. In addition,
some are occasionally exiled from their caravans for theft,
and these renegades can be found across Khul, working
as slavers, guards, mercenaries, and lone merchants,
peddling anything from medicinal potions to shark’s teeth
necklaces.
Far less sophisticated are the PYGMY LIZARD MEN of
southern Khul. These ferocious creatures may just be over
a metre in height, but are still strong and hardy, and
otherwise similar to the larger Lizard Men races in
appearance. They are armed with a variety of weapons,
such as spiked clubs, spears and javelins tipped with flint
or barbs of bone, and short bows with dart-like arrows. A
profusion of charms and amulets are strung around their
necks, and when hunting in groups of one to six creatures
they will also be wearing battle-kilts
of dried pandanus leaves. Several
different clans, each numbering from
three to eighteen Lizard Men, will
cluster around a special site, such as
a fresh-water spring or fruit-bearing
tree. Attacking one clan will rouse all
the others in the vicinity, for they
communicate using throat warbles
and Tok-Tok stick signals, whose
noise travels far through the still
jungle air. Due to their hardiness,
Pygmy Lizard Men are valued as
slaves and are becoming rarer in the
lands of the Inland Sea. They can be
found in isolated patches of rainforest
on both the island called the Roc, and
the Isle of Volcanoes, but their
greatest population lies in the
nameless jungles that stretch from
Shurrupak east to Hachiman.
