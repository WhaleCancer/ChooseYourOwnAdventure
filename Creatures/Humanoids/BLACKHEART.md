## Description

**Blackhearts** are a dangerous and cunning race of humanoids found across the wilds of Titan. They are known for their hostile nature and their skill with both melee and ranged weapons. Blackhearts are highly intelligent warriors who prefer to strike from ambush or use their superior tactics to overwhelm their enemies.

In appearance, Blackhearts are humanoid creatures with dark, often blackened features that give them their name. They are skilled fighters, equally adept with scimitars in close combat and long bows at range. Their high intelligence allows them to plan ambushes and coordinate attacks effectively, making them dangerous opponents despite their relatively modest SKILL score.

Blackhearts are typically encountered in small groups of one to three individuals when acting as scouts or raiders, or in larger bands of two to twelve when on a war party or raiding expedition. They are found in a variety of wilderness habitats, including hills, marshes, forests, plains, and other untamed regions. Their hostile nature means they will almost always attack intruders on their territory, though their intelligence allows them to assess threats and retreat if necessary.

These creatures are known for their ruthlessness and their preference for hit-and-run tactics. They will use their long bows to weaken enemies from a distance before closing in with their scimitars to finish the job. Their leather cuirasses provide light protection while maintaining their mobility, which is essential for their preferred combat style.
