## Description

**Eyeless Archers** are a mysterious and dangerous race of humanoids who have adapted to life without sight. Despite their lack of eyes, they are remarkably skilled archers, using their other senses and an uncanny ability to sense their targets to strike with deadly accuracy. **Eyeless Archers** are typically found in remote, isolated locations such as hills, caves, and ruins, where they have established small communities away from the prying eyes of other races.

**Eyeless Archers** have pale, featureless faces where their eyes should be, giving them an unsettling appearance. They rely on their exceptional hearing, sense of smell, and what some believe to be a form of extrasensory perception to navigate and hunt. Their archery skills are legendary, and they are known to be able to hit targets that would challenge even the most skilled sighted archers. **Eyeless Archers** are generally unfriendly to outsiders and will become hostile if they feel threatened or if their territory is invaded. They are highly intelligent and often serve as guardians or sentinels for important locations or treasures.
