## Description

There has long been confusion as to whether **Hags** are actually human, or something else instead. In appearance they resemble hideous old crones clad in tattered robes, with wart-covered faces and a wild-eyed stare. While this does make **Hags** look identical to the local village wise-women or even the multitudinous witches who inhabit the cursed village of Dree, there is some evidence to suggest that **Hags** may be something rather different. For example, it is known that **Hag's** hair, when ground down to form a compound with either a black pearl or a lotus flower, is capable of destroying the most powerful of Liches, such as Zanbar Bone the dread Night Prince. Interestingly, a whip crafted from **Hag's** hair and properly enchanted is said to destroy the souls of those it lashes, slaying them instantly with a single strike.

**Hags** are also accomplished wielders of magical spells. A typical **Hag**, if there is such a thing, will have a MAGIC score of 7, 16 Magic Points and 2-7 Wizardry spells that cost no more than 4 Magic Points to cast. They will likely also be able to cast Minor Magic spells as well. In addition, a **Hag** will be able to use one of the following Priestly Powers: Curse, Ill-Luck, or Weakness. They will only be able to use this power once per day, with an equivalent DEVOTION score of 7. **Hags** are usually found in foul and desolate places: the sewers of old cities (where they feast upon rats!), among their weaker human sisters in decrepit settlements such as Dree and Weirtown, and exiled to lonely hovels out in the wilderness. They are known cannibals, and if all their magical powers fail they will simply draw a razor-sharp dagger from their rags and attack, in a bid to guarantee fresh meat for one of their loathsome stews!

**SEA HAGS** are considered by some to be yet more evidence that **Hags** are not quite human. The reasoning runs that they are rather different to Merfolk, which are humans kidnapped by the sea god Hydana to populate his underwater realm. **Sea Hags** appear similar to their land-based sisters, though with a more greenish hue to their skin and gills on their neck that allow them to breathe. They still worship Shekka, goddess of witchcraft, in addition to a host of Dark Lords and Demon Princes, but are more powerful sorceresses with MAGIC 8, DEVOTION 8, and 18 Magic Points on average. **Sea Hags** are even rumoured to be able to create a strange form of undersea fire that heats their cauldrons and cooking-pots! They are found in the colder waters of Titan, often lurking in a dark cave near a ship-wrecked stretch of coastline, within deep fissures along the sea-floor, and among the sunken ruins of ancient cities such as Atlantis.
