## Description

First came N'yadach, cruel master of all.
Then crept lowly Skorn, forever in thrall.
But rebellion's fire burnt palace and hall,
And sore-abused servants brought on their

downfall.

– Ancient Dwarfish rhyme
In times gone by, the SKORN were enslaved by the N'yadach
and were set to build elaborate underground palaces for
their cruel masters. But war came, an endless, costly war
against the Dwarfish nations, and the Skorn were put to
work building siege-engines instead. They worked until they
dropped, and were then whipped until they rose again. The
Skorn were typically patient, thoughtful creatures, but,
sweating away in the darkness, they plotted to overthrow
their evil captors. A major offensive by the Dwarfs provided
them with a distraction: they killed their guards with dag-
gers secretly made from flint, and threw off their chains.
Their chambers were soon overrun by the Dwarfs, with
whom they joined forces to cleanse the caverns and tunnels
of the N'yadach. Once the war was won, their allies gave
them a large district for their part in the conflict, and the two
races have remained friendly to this day.
Skorn are a little over a metre high, hunched and stooped
from years of mining and tunnelling. They have large, bald
heads with high ridged foreheads. Their eyes are deep-set
and piercing, enabling them to see well in near darkness.
Their faces look distinctly like those of Hobgoblins and Ores,
though it is not thought that they are related. From the sides
of their mouths poke small upturned fangs, which they use
to chew up the rats and other scuttlers they live on. Their
bodies are muscular and completely hairless. Skorn typically
dress in short loincloths and leather-thonged sandals, with a
thin stiletto-like dagger thrust through their belts. They will

often be covered in dust and sweat, and carrying picks and
lanterns. They are by nature relentless builders, and very
territorial too. They do not take kindly to trespassers in their
tunnels, and will escort them brusquely but calmly away
from the area.
It is thought that Skorn are ruled over by a powerful warrior,
a descendant of the heroes of their rebellion, who lives in a
vast cavern encrusted with precious metals and gems and
illuminated by many torches.
