## Description

The **Exo-Beast** is a peculiar being, typically found roaming dark, underground passages, or wandering the fringes of deserts and the wilderness in small hunting packs looking for prey. Basically humanoid in nature, it derives its name from the hard, armoured exo-skeleton which covers most of its body. The thick plates of this natural armour are darkish red to brown in colour, and studded with short spikes. The **Exo-Beast** stands just under two metres in height, and is quite strong and muscular in build, with a reptile-like head that is surmounted by a bony crest. Its left hand is like that of a normal human, but its right is a large, crab-like pincer.

In combat the **Exo-Beast** will usually use the pincer to grab and crush its opponents, while wielding a mace or scimitar in its other hand. The pincer is a formidable weapon, capable of inflicting serious damage and potentially disarming or restraining enemies. **Exo-Beasts** are aggressive hunters that will attack most creatures they encounter, using their natural armour and dual weapons to overwhelm their prey.
