## Description

In the dank, forbidding depths of dungeons deep below the ground, many perils stalk the darkness in search of their next meal. The **Night Stalkers** were perhaps human once, but they are something less than human now. Bent over from their endless wanderings in the oppressive tunnels, they are sinewy beings, covered in folds of leathery grey skin. Their facial features are gruesome – eyes sunk deep into sockets and permanently squinting, teeth as long as a man's little finger, skin wrinkled and warty. Their arms are long and thin, and end in large, clawed hands that can split stone or skulls with equal ease. They may be carrying a small lantern to guide their unceasing patrols, and they may wear pretty, worthless trinkets stolen from past victims for the nice way they sparkle in the wan lantern light.
