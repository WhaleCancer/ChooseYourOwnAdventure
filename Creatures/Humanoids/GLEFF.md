## Description

**Gleff** are dangerous humanoid creatures that dwell in the dark, underground regions of Titan. They are weird hybrids created by the sorcerer Omeron, who bred [Rock-Eaters](Rock-Eater.md) with [Goblins](../Forces of Evil/Goblins/Goblin.md) to create these unnatural creatures.

**Gleff** are immediately recognizable by their most distinctive feature: a large, powerful claw that serves as their primary weapon. This natural weapon makes them formidable opponents in close combat, capable of delivering devastating strikes. They wear medium armour, providing them with decent protection while maintaining their mobility in the cramped confines of their underground habitats.

These creatures are typically encountered in small groups of 1-6 individuals, often lurking in caves, dungeons, or ancient ruins where they can ambush unwary travelers. **Gleff** are naturally hostile and unfriendly, viewing most other creatures as either threats or potential prey. Their average intelligence means they are capable of basic tactics and coordination, making them dangerous when encountered in groups.

**Gleff** prefer dark, enclosed spaces where their natural weapons and armour give them an advantage. They are territorial and will aggressively defend their lairs from intruders. Adventurers who venture into their domains should be prepared for a fierce battle, as **Gleff** rarely show mercy to those who disturb their dark sanctuaries.
