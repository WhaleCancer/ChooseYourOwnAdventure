## Description

The **Nikrechaun** is a poorly understood relative of the [Leprechaun](Leprechaun.md), but it is not known whether they are a lesser variant, or perhaps a juvenile form. What is known about this rare member of the [Fairy](Fairy.md) race, is that they are short, pointy-eared individuals, with mischievous grins and ragged clothing (usually with a dagger concealed somewhere on their person).

**Nikrechauns** are generally friendly towards other creatures, though their mischievous nature can sometimes lead to harmless pranks and tricks. They are highly intelligent and often found in small groups, wandering through various terrains in search of adventure or treasure. Despite their friendly demeanor, **Nikrechauns** are not to be underestimated, as they are skilled with their concealed daggers and can be quite resourceful when threatened.
