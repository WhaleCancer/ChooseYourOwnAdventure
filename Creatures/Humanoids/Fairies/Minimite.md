## Description

Thought to be related to [Fairies](Fairy.md) and [Sprites](Sprite.md), **Minimites** are tiny, thin, child-like humanoids with greenish-hued skin and transparent insect-like wings. They flutter about deep woods and forested hills, where they live solitary lives lairing within a hole in a tree trunk, or underneath a rocky overhang. Should a lone wayfarer or group of travellers stumble past the **Minimite's** humble abode, it will immediately attach itself to them, chattering incessantly, resting on their shoulders, and sharing their food and drink (particularly ale, which they have a real fondness for!). Due to their high SKILL score (with a Dodge Special Skill score of 8), **Minimites** can be difficult to get rid of. This will be a problem if their host is a magic-user, as **Minimites** are surrounded at all times by a protective anti-magic aura. Any spell that costs 6 or less Magic Points or STAMINA will automatically fail in the presence of a **Minimite**. Only spells that cost more than this will work, usually killing the **Minimite** in the process, due to the explosive release of magical power.

The origins of this defensive enchantment lie back in the mists of time, before the War of the Wizards, when **Minimites** were renowned across the Old World as great wizards and well-versed in the practice of high sorcery. When the forces of Chaos erupted out of Kakhabad nearly three centuries ago, the **Minimites** banded together to cast a spell developed by the insane mystic Aughm Lightchaser that would unleash the power of Goodness in a devastating blast of intense energy. The spell worked, obliterating the armies of Evil, but exacting a terrible curse upon the race of **Minimites**. The use of magic was outlawed among their own kind, resulting in the development of the anti-magic aura they possess, and intricate spells woven into their very being prevented them from meeting up with their own kind for more than short periods of time. **Minimites** thus became a race of nomadic individuals avoiding each other like the plague and dwelling alone in the wilderness. Perhaps the most famous **Minimite** of recent times is the individual known simply as Jann, who played some part in returning the Crown of Kings to Analand after it was stolen by the Archmage of Mampang.

**Mites**, by contrast, are about twice the size of **Minimites**, but with half the intelligence. They lack the magical protective aura of their smaller brethren, and are also much clumsier fliers. Some scholars conjecture that **Mites** represent a primitive offshoot, from which more advanced races, such as **Fairies**, **Sprites** and **Minimites** are ultimately derived. Regardless, they live in similar territory, such as rolling hills and wooded glades interspersed with meadow-lands and band together in small groups to eke out a living on berries, nuts and home-brewed dandelion wine. **Mites** are sometimes captured by hunters and put to work in sideshow attractions, retrieving objects in a cabinet of fortune, or wrestling with [Pixies](Pixie.md) in pint-sized gladiatorial contests. Kind-hearted people who free them from such awful captivity have been known to be rewarded by the grateful **Mite**, with directions to the nearest treasure cache or similar boon!
