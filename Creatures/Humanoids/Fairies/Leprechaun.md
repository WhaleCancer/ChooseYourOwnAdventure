## Description

Many an adventurer has come to grief at the hands of a group of mischievous **Leprechauns**. They are small magical humanoids, at most a metre tall, which delight in playing tricks on unsuspecting people. They will appear out of nowhere, dressed in baggy clothes (usually coloured a dazzling spring green) and chuckling merrily. They may throw a rotten tomato, or just beckon for the person to follow them, laughing all the time in their squeaky little voices. They will lead their new acquaintance to where their fellows lie in wait, ready to play more tricks and hopefully steal some treasure or food.

**Leprechauns** can fly, hovering about in the air without the aid of wings, as well as turn invisible at will, conjure up illusions, and so on. If their foolish victims try to attack them, the **Leprechauns** will simply toss some magic dust in their faces, which will cause paralysis for an hour or more, and give the pests plenty of time to loot as much as they can carry. However, should their victim prove actually to have a sense of humour, and share their jokes (despite being the butt of them), the **Leprechauns** may become friendly and help him on his way â€“ though they won't return anything they've stolen.
