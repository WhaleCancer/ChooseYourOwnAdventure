## Description

**Black Fairies** are the most evil of all the little people. Thought to have been [Fairies](Fairy.md) that were tainted by the warped power of Chaos, they are small humanoids about a metre tall, with dark skin, pointed ears, cat-like eyes and short, powerful wings. **Black Fairies** lack most of their relatives' innate magical power (including the ability to alter their size), but do delight in trapping unfortunate wayfarers in fine-mesh nets and other dastardly snares. Once they have captured somebody, they will take all of their victim's possessions, and abandon them to their fate. If the victim is lucky, they may be able to squirm free and escape before being devoured by some forest predator. If they are unlucky however, the victim may well find that the **Black Fairies** have left them at the base of a [Giant Pitcher Plant](../../Plants/Giant-Pitcher-Plant.md) or a similarly carnivorous shrub. Like their **Fairy** cousins, **Black Fairies** prefer using such tricks and traps, and they will attack only as a last resort, usually with a simple dagger or sling.
