## Description

**Sprites** are tiny woodland creatures thought to be related to [Elvin](../Elves/Elvin.md) and [Pixies](Pixie.md) (they are sometimes mistakenly called Wood Pixies). They grow to about forty centimetres, and usually dress in clothes of green or brown. Their most noticeable feature is the pair of delicate, gossamer-thin wings which stretch out from their shoulders for almost half a metre. **Sprites** can fly well, flitting in and out of the trees of their forest home. They are peaceful creatures, and are rather shy of larger beings; they will normally try to hide when approached by a human. The only large beings they trust at all are [Elves](../Elves/), who they know will not harm them.

If threatened, or if they are feeling especially brave and mischievous, **Sprites** can always resort to their magical powers. They know a number of spells, including Drowsiness, which will send its target to sleep for a short while, and a whole host of illusions, including the creation of false treasure, and the sudden appearance of contagious boils on someone's face. Their magic is not really harmful to anyone, but can give the **Sprite** time to flee the area or fetch stronger help.
