## Description

**Pixies** are tiny, delicate humanoids, usually encountered in areas well away from humans, who seem to enjoy tormenting the little beings. They are peaceful creatures who care for nature and natural things. **Pixies** stand about half a metre tall, and are typically dressed in human-style clothing of browns or greens. They live together in small villages hidden away in the countryside. Here they tend their crops and generally live a contented life away from larger beings. Occasionally, however, they may be encountered elsewhere, perhaps in the villages of [Dwarves](../Dwarves/DWARF.md) or in open country.

**Pixies** don't automatically loathe humans â€“ they are far too well mannered â€“ but they will be very wary of any they meet unless they prove to be genuinely friendly. They will avoid starting a fight with a larger being, for they know it would be suicidal for them. Nevertheless, if set upon, they will defend themselves as best they can with their short knives. Should they ever encounter a [Sprite](Sprite.md), however, they will waste no time in setting about it. Perhaps they are jealous of the wings and magic powers of **Sprites**; at any rate, **Pixies** will always fight the unfortunate creatures to the death.
