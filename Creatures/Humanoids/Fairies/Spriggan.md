## Description

**Spriggans** are a race of fey humanoids found in forests and hills across Titan. They are intelligent creatures with a deep connection to nature and the land, related to [Fairies](Fairy.md) and other fey beings. Spriggans are typically encountered in small groups, ranging from two to twelve individuals, and they are known for their territorial nature and protective instincts regarding their domains.

Like Fairies, Spriggans are capable of magically altering their size, growing up to the height of a normal human. This ability allows them to appear as small fey creatures or as human-sized beings, depending on their needs. In appearance, Spriggans are humanoid but with features that suggest their fey nature. They are skilled with daggers and short swords, and they wear leather cuirasses for protection.

Their high intelligence allows them to plan and coordinate effectively, making them dangerous opponents despite their relatively modest physical statistics. Spriggans are generally neutral to unfriendly towards outsiders, viewing them with suspicion until they prove themselves trustworthy. They are protective of their forest and hill territories and will defend them against intruders. Despite their sometimes hostile nature, Spriggans are not inherently evil and may be reasoned with by those who show respect for nature and their domains.
