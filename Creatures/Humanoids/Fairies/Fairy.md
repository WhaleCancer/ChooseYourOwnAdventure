## Description

The **Fairies**, known also as Faeries or the Fay, represent the mysterious Fifth Race that were rumoured to have been created at the same time as the more populous humans, Giants, Dwarfs and Elves of Titan. They are in fact the secret children of the goddess Galana, and know hidden mysteries of the plants that even [Wood Elves](../../Out-of-the-Pit/Humanoids/Elves/Wood-Elf.md) do not know. **Fairies** are found in enchanted glades, gardens of purity, or crystalline caves across all three continents of Titan, and their tiny settlements are ruled by a female **Fairy** (known as a Sylph), who is their Queen. The **Fairy** Queen gains much of her power from a magical garland she wears that is crafted from obscure herbs. **Fairies** are small winged humanoids, similar to Sprites or [Minimites](../MINIMITE.md), though often clad in gaudy finery. They are usually invisible to mortal eyes, appearing only as small flares of light that glow in the air and then die out, as if large fireflies were darting around. Often, the only indication of their presence will be the flutter of tiny wings and a series of high-pitched chirpings.

Like [Spriggans](../SPRIGGAN.md), **Fairies** are also capable of magically altering their size, growing up to the height of a normal human. This has led to some interesting situations: for example, King Ossil the Harmful, founder of the ancient city-state of Gundobad, took a **Fairy** wife (who stole a thousand blue gems from the Ice Demons to adorn his iron crown of rulership), and all the descendants of Ossil's unbroken lineage still carry **Fairy** blood in their veins to this day.

**Fairies** are mischievous creatures with unpredictable natures. A favourite trick is to steal all the Gold Pieces of anyone unfortunate enough to disturb one of their revelries while simultaneously curing the intruder's wounds, restoring their STAMINA back to its Initial level. Alternatively, roll a die and consult the table below to see what minor outrage they have perpetrated:

| Die Roll | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Cut a hole in someone's backpack. All contents will fall out and the backpack is useless. |
| 2 | Bite someone on the back of their neck. Causes 1 STAMINA point of damage. |
| 3 | Undo the seams of someone's clothes. Clothes fall apart. |
| 4 | Steal one item from someone's backpack. |
| 5 | Throw a stone at someone's head for 1 STAMINA point of damage. |
| 6 | Tie someone's bootlaces together. As soon as they move, they will trip up, falling over for 1 STAMINA point of damage. |

Some of this unpredictability has been captured in an enchanted artifact known as the Ring of Fays. Made from pale silver and cut with strange patterns, the Ring of Fays will aid the bearer once only, usually as a protection against harm. If confronted by too dire a foe however, the **Fairy** spirits trapped within the ring may refuse any entreaty and prefer to remain ensorcelled within their confinement!

**Black Fairies** on the other hand, are the most evil of all the little people. Thought to have been **Fairies** that were tainted by the warped power of Chaos, they are small humanoids about a metre tall, with dark skin, pointed ears, cat-like eyes and short, powerful wings. **Black Fairies** lack most of their relatives' innate magical power (including the ability to alter their size), but do delight in trapping unfortunate wayfarers in fine-mesh nets and other dastardly snares. Once they have captured somebody, they will take all of their victim's possessions, and abandon them to their fate. If the victim is lucky, they may be able to squirm free and escape before being devoured by some forest predator. If they are unlucky however, the victim may well find that the **Black Fairies** have left them at the base of a [Giant Pitcher Plant](../../Out-of-the-Pit/Plants/Giant-Pitcher-Plant.md) or a similarly carnivorous shrub. Like their **Fairy** cousins, **Black Fairies** prefer using such tricks and traps, and they will attack only as a last resort, usually with a simple dagger or sling.
