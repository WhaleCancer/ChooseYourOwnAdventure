## Description

There is probably less known about the strange race of Elf-like humanoids called **Miks** than any other beings. They are very rare, appearing without warning in a group of perhaps two or three, before departing again as if they had never been there. Worse, **Miks** are masters of illusion, able to transform themselves into any shape or form they desire. As a result, few have seen them as they really are – pale, emaciated humanoids with large, intelligent heads.

A **Mik's** mastery of illusion is astounding. If it is disguised as a venomous snake, for example, and bites someone, he will die from the bite! They cannot, for some reason, simulate or use metal in their disguises, however, and their illusions cannot be cast over other objects or beings. They are a highly mischievous and aggressive race, and delight in playfully killing anyone they meet. They love gold, though, and can sometimes be bribed into letting someone go free. If threatened with violence, they will respond with their favourite weapon, a needle-knife (a thin stiletto-like dagger), or just turn into a bird and fly away!
