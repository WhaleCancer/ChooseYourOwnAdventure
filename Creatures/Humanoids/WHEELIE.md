## Description

There are many bizarre, impossible creatures scattered
across the wild land of Allansia, but WHEELIES are possibly
the oddest of them all!
These weird creatures are disc-shaped, with large faces in the
centre of one side. From around the edge of their circular
bodies sprout four hands, enabling them to move by cart-
wheeling along! They fight with small knives, which they
can launch at high speed as they tumble along on their
hands. The knives will hit on a roll of 1-3 on one die, for 2
points of STAMINA damage; each Wheelie will typically be
carrying two of them. But they are not so adept at hand-to-
hand fighting. Wheelies can sometimes find employment in
the service of a lord or wizard, for they make good guards.
Many a would-be thief will think twice when faced with a
few of these whirling beings, throwing speeding daggers as
they spin towards him!
