## Description

To many unfortunate adventurers, there appeared nothing
dangerous about the bent old woman, her head covered by a
thick shawl. Most offered to help her, drawing near to lend a
strong arm to steady the poor old crone. And then she threw
back her shawl and fixed them with a red-eyed stare, and they
were lost .. .
A MEDUSA is a strange humanoid that looks much like a
wizened old lady dressed in ragged clothes. However, in
place of normal hair there sprouts a mass of wriggling snakes!
It usually dwells in isolated ruins or caves, well away from
other creatures, but ventures out occasionally to search for
prey. When it encounters a choice human, the Medusa will
attempt to trick him into gazing into its sickly red eyes.
Anyone failing a Test for Luck will be caught by its stare, and
cannot turn away. His limbs will begin to stiffen and within
a few moments he will be nothing but solid stone! If its
intended victim is swift enough to cover his eyes, the Medusa
will approach and allow its snakes to lash out and bite him.
Fighting the Medusa with eyes closed, slashing from side to
side with a sword, temporarily reduces the opponent's SKILL
by 2 points. If, by some chance, the Medusa's prey is carrying
a mirror or some other reflective device like a polished shield,
the Medusa may look into it. A Test for Luck is required for
such a chancy manoeuvre; if it succeeds, the vile creature will
transmute into rock and crumble to dust in an instant.
