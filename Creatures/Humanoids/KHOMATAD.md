## Description

**Khomatads** are a warrior race of humanoids found in the deserts, wilderness, plains, and towns of Titan. They are highly intelligent and skilled fighters, known for their martial prowess and organized raiding parties. Khomatads are typically hostile to outsiders, viewing them as potential threats or targets for their raids.

These warriors are well-equipped with spears or curved scimitars, and they wear leather cuirasses for protection. They are organized into small scouting parties of one to six individuals or larger raiding bands of three to eighteen warriors. Khomatads are adaptable, able to operate effectively in both desert wilderness and settled areas, making them dangerous opponents whether encountered in the wilds or in towns.

Their high intelligence allows them to plan sophisticated raids and coordinate their attacks effectively. Khomatads are territorial and protective of their domains, and they will not hesitate to attack those they perceive as intruders or enemies. Their presence in towns suggests they may also serve as mercenaries or guards, though their hostile nature makes them unpredictable allies.
