## Description

The WOODLINGS of the Forest of Yore and other older
areas of woodland are a shy race of small humans related to
Sprites. Standing about a meters tall, they are quiet, almost
dour in personality, and rarely associate with other crea-
tures, considering them destructive and troublesome. Wood-
lings are rarely seen by man, since they dress in browns and
greens, and are very adept at hiding in bushes and trees.
They are alert at all times, as nervous and skittish as deer,
and their acute hearing and inbuilt sixth sense mean they are
never surprised by danger. Hunters and foresters have
sometimes stumbled upon their settlements – circles of small
huts built around tree-trunks from woven branches and
roofed with large leaves– only to be repulsed by the inhabit-
ants, who fight to the death with daggers and poisoned
throwing-darts. Upon returning in force to such settlements,
the men have always found them deserted, abandoned by
the Woodlings for fear of being discovered again.
Occasionally, however, Woodlings are said to have helped
lone humans who have been caught in poachers' traps or lost
in the depths of the forests. The secretive humanoids ap-
peared out of the trees, helped the unfortunates by freeing
them or leading them to the edge of the woodland, and then
melted back into the trees without a word. Such stories are
rare; in many villages they appear more as legend than truth,
and are believed by few.
