## Description

Many people know **Elvins** only as strange, twinkling lights that can sometimes be seen dancing among the trees at night, or as snatches of chattering and laughter that will drift down on the wind. Few people ever meet the Elvins of the Shamutanti Hills face to face; some are totally unaware that they even exist. They are secretive little beings, related to Elves and [Woodlings](../WOODLING.md), and dwell in a number of small villages deep in the heart of thick woodland. They are only half a metre tall, with delicate features – slanted eyes, pointed ears, thin limbs. They are immensely mischievous and magical, and seem to spend much of their time playing frivolous pranks on one another, and other unfortunate beings too.

Elvins' magic powers include the ability to fly or hover in the air at will (without wings!). They can also cause a brilliant glow to appear around themselves, so that they can see in the dark. They love to play tricks by suddenly turning off their glow and then tripping up or stealing something from somebody. They expect their victims to take their pranks good-naturedly. If they can't see the joke, the Elvins may decide to teach them a lesson in humour, by attacking them with their shortswords. When flying, an Elvin adds 2 points to its Attack Strength as it dodges about in the air. Once it has been wounded, however, the spell will be broken and it will have to fight on foot. For all their magic, Elvins are fascinated by true sorcery and will be so impressed by a loud or brilliant spell that they may forget their fight and watch with delight.
