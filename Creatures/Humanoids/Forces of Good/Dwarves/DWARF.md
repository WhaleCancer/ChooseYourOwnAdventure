## Description

There are some races which were roaming the earth when man was still swinging about in trees. Nowadays most of them, especially [Elves](../Elves/Wood-Elf.md), keep out of men's affairs as much as they are able. The **Dwarves**, however, have long learnt to live alongside the younger race, who recognize them as doughty warriors and skilled craftsmen. The town of Stone-bridge on the Red River is almost exclusively inhabited by Dwarves, but in many other settlements they live alongside men.

A typical Dwarf stands only about a metre tall, yet looks a good deal older than the humans who tower over him. Their faces are wrinkled and weather-beaten, usually somewhere between ruddy-pink and brown. Their fashion is for long bushy beards, some of which are so long they need to be plaited and wrapped around their waists like belts. Their clothes are made from fine worked leather, though these will usually be covered with light jerkins of strong mail. Their favourite weapons are battle-axes, war-hammers and other hewing weapons, for they are skilled at mining and stone-working as well as fighting.

Dwarves are fond of ale, pipe tobacco and a good tale of heroic deeds. They are not so fond of over-hasty people, preferring to take life steadily and calmly. Sometimes quick of anger if slighted by an ill-mannered human, they are not averse to teaching some manners. They can be very honourable beings, however, and they appreciate bravery and good fighting. They despise [Orcs](../../Forces%20of%20Evil/Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md), [Goblins](../../Forces%20of%20Evil/Goblins/Common-Goblin.md) and other cruel cowardly beings, and stories of their interminable wars deep under the earth are frequent. Above all, Dwarves love precious jewels and metals, and they spend much of their time mining them from the earth before jealously hoarding them away from potential thieves.

Their starting SKILL of 4 (from creature SKILL 7) and STAMINA of 7 reflect their status as doughty warriors. Their high intelligence and skilled craftsmanship are reflected in their Craft skill. Their expertise in mining and stone-working is represented by Underground Lore.

Their ability to live alongside humans and their honorable nature are reflected in their higher social class (1 or 2).
