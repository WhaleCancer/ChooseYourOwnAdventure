## Description

In the times before the rise of human civilization, the different Elven races went their separate ways across the world. The taint of evil had split them into two factions. In the wars that followed, the side of Good won, however, and their opponents were forced to retreat beneath the earth, leaving the forests to the [Wood Elves](Wood-Elf.md). In time all memory of these evil tribes was forgotten. In the darkness of their subterranean world, though, the **Dark Elves** grew strong again, and their civilization developed.

Over the centuries their physical form changed, and they became very thin and gaunt, with midnight-black skin and green eyes. Their minds developed too, and they became more and more evil. Their sorcerers began to rule them, and their culture became decadent with slaves, demon worship and grisly magical rituals, for they had perverted the ancient Elven magic to their own ends. They have an inbuilt hatred of all surface-dwellers, and small bands of Dark Elves continue to raid isolated areas, burning and looting whatever they find. When on the surface they shield themselves under large, black, hooded cloaks.

Below ground, however, Dark Elves look very different, dressing in bizarre, ornate clothes and decorating their hair and bodies with strange patterns and colours. Their favourite weapons are still bows, though in the confines below they prefer long serrated knives, fashioned in strange metals and with powerful magic bound into them in jagged ancient runes. Despite their hatred of the surface world, the Dark Elves know they could never return to live there. But their hatred continues unabated, and their raiding parties will always stalk the earth, killing or abducting any they meet.

### Design Notes

Dark Elves have a base value of 8 (SKILL 5 + STAMINA 3), which exactly matches the benchmark of 8. This grants them the standard 6 design points, but they require 8 points for their full specialized build. Their higher starting SKILL (5 vs standard Elf's 4) reflects their superior combat abilities and centuries of warfare. Their evil nature and underground adaptation are reflected in their skill set, with Underground Lore and their preference for subterranean environments. Their social class is lower (0-1) due to their hostile nature and evil alignment, making them similar to monster races in terms of social acceptance.
