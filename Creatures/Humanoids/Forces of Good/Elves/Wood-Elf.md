## Description

The most common of all the Elven races are the **Wood Elves**, who may be encountered in any large forest. They are friendly, peaceful beings who love nature and spend much of their time caring for plants, trees and the other denizens of the forests. They don't much care for Dwarfs, because they are unable to understand how they can shut themselves away from the beautiful surface world. Wood Elves loathe Orcs, Trolls and the other inhuman races for their ugliness and their insistence on burning down forests and murdering innocent creatures out of hand. As far as humans are concerned, they are undecided. They know that some are their allies in fighting the forces of Evil, while others are in league with the Orcs and their foul ilk. If adventurers are friendly and respectful, Wood Elves will give them all the help they need. If they prove violent and destructive, they will not be allowed to take another step into the Elves' domain.

Wood Elves prefer to dress in soft green clothes which allow them to blend with their overgrown surroundings. They are skilled in all the woodland crafts, and can track their prey in complete silence until they wish to strike. They are superb bowmen, hitting 5 times in 6 for 3 points of STAMINA damage. In combat they will use shortswords to great effect. They dwell in large hidden villages protected both by overgrown vegetation and powerful magic. The Wood Elves ensure that only those they trust can find their villages. All others who seek them will become lost and wander around without ever getting near them. In their villages the Elves are ruled over by proud nobles, both great warriors and spell-casters, who rule fairly and justly over all the creatures of the forest.

### Design Notes

Wood Elves have a base value of 8 (SKILL 5 + STAMINA 3), which exactly matches the benchmark of 8. This grants them the standard 6 design points, but they require 8 points to match their woodland specialization. Their higher starting SKILL (5 vs standard Elf's 4) reflects their superior combat abilities and archery skills. The base value calculation results in no LUCK penalty, maintaining the standard starting LUCK of 8.
