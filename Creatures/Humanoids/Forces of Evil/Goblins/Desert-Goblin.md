## Description

The **Desert Goblin** is thought by some scholars to be an offshoot of the great and almost-forgotten Goblin 'civilization' that once flourished in the south-western lands of Khul, around the immense and unpronounceable Lake Mlubz. Constant conflict with the growing human kingdoms to the west forced tribes of **Goblins** out into the inhospitable wilderness that is the Scythera Desert. Over generations, these **Goblins** adapted to the harsh desert environment, developing lighter skin tones and learning to survive in the arid wasteland. **Desert Goblins** are more organized than their common cousins, often forming larger raiding parties to strike at caravans and settlements along desert trade routes.

### Design Notes

Desert Goblins have a base value of 7 (SKILL 4 + STAMINA 3), which is 1 point below the benchmark of 8. To match the Common Goblin's skill set (with Desert Lore replacing Underground Lore), they require 10 design points total. This reflects their adaptation to harsh desert conditions and more organized nature compared to their common cousins, while maintaining the same breadth of racial abilities. Their higher starting SKILL and characteristic bonus reflect their improved combat abilities and organizational skills developed through generations of desert raiding.
