## Description

Deep beneath the surface of Titan, in forbidden underground [Dark Elf](../../Forces%20of%20Good/Elves/Dark-Elf.md) cities such as Tiranduil Kelthas, the Clan Tesarath create loathsome hybrids in their dank breeding pits. In Khul for example, we find the **Trackers**, one of the results of these dark experiments. Trackers are thought to be the result of interbreeding between [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md) and other creatures, possibly [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md) or even Dark Elves themselves.

**Trackers** are skilled hunters and pursuers, created specifically for their ability to track down and capture targets. They are intelligent and cunning, with a natural talent for following trails and hunting their prey. Trackers are typically found in small groups, working together to corner and capture their targets. They are well-equipped with short swords and throwing daggers, and wear leather cuirasses for protection.

These creatures are hostile by nature, serving the dark purposes of their creators. They are often used by Dark Elves and other evil forces to hunt down escaped slaves, track enemies, or capture specific targets. Their average-high intelligence makes them more dangerous than simple beasts, and they can plan and coordinate their hunts effectively.
