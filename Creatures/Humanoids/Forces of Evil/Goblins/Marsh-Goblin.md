## Description

**Marsh Goblins** are similar to common [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md), but with a few notable differences. They are thinner, with green-tinted, almost scaly skins, and their hands and feet are webbed for swimming. They spend most of their time skulking in the mud and reeds of their swampland homes, often raiding Kokomokoa, whom they hate. **Marsh Goblins** like humans even less than their land-based relatives do, and they delight, for example, in tying a captive to a board and leaving him for Giant Leeches to drain slowly of blood.

### Design Notes

Marsh Goblins have a base value of 4 (SKILL 2 + STAMINA 2), which is 4 points below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 4 additional design points (10 total instead of 6), matching the Common Goblin's skill set with Marsh Lore replacing Underground Lore. Their webbed hands and feet, green-tinted scaly skin, and aquatic adaptations make them well-suited to their swampy habitats, though they share the same base characteristics and design point allocation as their common cousins.
