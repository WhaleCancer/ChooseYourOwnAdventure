## Overview

**Goblins** are crude humanoid creatures found causing trouble across many lands of Titan. Smaller than [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc.md) but just as disgusting, they are ugly, brown-skinned beings typically about a metre and a half tall. While most **Goblins** serve alongside **Orcs**, [Ogres](../Ogres/OGRE.md), and [Trolls](../Trolls/) in the armies of Chaos, various subspecies have adapted to different environments, developing unique characteristics and abilities suited to their habitats.

### [Half-Goblin](Half-Goblin.md)

Hybrids of men and Goblins, man-sized but with Goblin-like features such as big ears, a large nose, sharp teeth and green or brown-hued skin. Usually outcasts from both parent races, they are drawn to chaotic cityports where they find work as mercenaries, guards, and soldiers.

Possibly the result of interbreeding between Goblins and Orcs, Hobgoblins are tall gangling creatures as tall as men.

## Playing Goblins as Characters

All goblin variants can be played as player characters using the Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Edition New Races rules. The following chart compares the different goblin types for character creation:

### Calculating Starting Characteristics

Starting characteristics are calculated from creature statistics using the [New Races rules](../../../../.obsidian/AFF/New-Races.md):

- **Starting SKILL:** Creature SKILL - 3
- **Starting STAMINA:** Creature STAMINA (used as listed)
- **Starting LUCK:** 8 (base value), adjusted if base value (SKILL + STAMINA/2) differs from 8

**Example:** A Common Goblin has creature SKILL 5 and STAMINA 5:

- Starting SKILL: 5 - 3 = 2
- Starting STAMINA: 5
- Base Value: 2 + (5/2) = 2 + 2 = 4 (4 below benchmark of 8, so starting LUCK remains 8)
