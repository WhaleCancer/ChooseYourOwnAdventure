## Description

The fecundity of [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md) interbreeding with other creatures to create new races, such as the Gark, [Hobgoblin](../../Hobgoblin.md), and Tracker, is well known, and to this list we can add the **Half-Goblin**. These are hybrids of men and **Goblins**, and are man-sized but with Goblin-like features such as big ears, a large nose, sharp teeth and green or brown-hued skin. Like their fellow halfbreeds the [Man-Orcs](../Orcs/Man-Orc.md), **Half-Goblins** are usually outcasts from both parent races, and eventually drawn to chaotic cityports such as Port Blacksand or Ashkyos. Here they find work as mercenaries, guards, and soldiers, and thus most **Half-Goblins** have reasonable warrior skills. Some then return back to the wilderness, intent on forming their own bands of outcasts and misfits.

### Design Notes

Half-Goblins have a base value of 7 (SKILL 4 + STAMINA 3), which is 1 point below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 1 additional design point (7 total instead of 6), but they use a minimal build. Their starting SKILL of 4 (from creature SKILL 7) and STAMINA of 7 reflect their hybrid nature, being larger and stronger than full Goblins but still smaller than humans. Their warrior skills and work as mercenaries and guards is represented by their Melee Combat skill. Their outcast nature and need to be aware of threats is reflected in their Awareness skill. Their Goblin heritage is represented by their Dark Seeing talent. Their outcast status from both parent races is reflected in their lower social class (0 or 1).
