## Description

The mysterious race of evil, shaggy humanoids known as the **Toa-Suo** inhabit caves and sheltered valleys in the icy wastes north of Icefinger Mountains. They are thought to be descended from [Hobgoblin](Hobgoblin.md) stock, but have long since adapted to life in sub-zero temperatures. Standing a little under two metres tall, and almost as broad, they are covered in sleek waves of white or light grey hair, save only for their faces and the palms of their hands, which are hairless, with a leathery covering of pinky skin.

Known to some as 'Snow Devils', **Toa-Suo** are carnivorous, and hunt incessantly across the icy reaches of the north. They fight with their claws, but have sometimes been seen throwing rocks and small boulders when ambushing prey from above. Strong and totally fearless, they have even been known to take on Frost Giants, though many of their number might die in such an attack. After a successful skirmish, the **Toa-Suo** gather up the corpses of all the dead, including their own, and drag them home to be eaten. In such desolate climes, creatures can't afford to let scruples about cannibalism stop them from eating what may be their only meal for a week. A **Toa-Suo's** whole existence revolves around finding the next meal, and packs of them roam far and wide in search of likely food. These creatures have a keen sense of direction and smell, and are often found in the company of Snow Wolves, which they use in tracking prey.

The race is divided into a large number of small tribes, which are further split into small family groups, or 'hearths'. For the most part, individual groups have little or nothing to do with one another. They don't appear to inhabit set hunting-areas; rather, each group roams where it pleases, taking whatever it comes across. At every winter solstice, however, all the hearths gather at a peculiar crag known in southern tales as Comrak, where they engage in ritual combat and feasting before dispersing once more into the frozen wilderness.
