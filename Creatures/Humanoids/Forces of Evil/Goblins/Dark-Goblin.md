## Description

**Dark Goblins** are a sinister variant of [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md) that have adapted to life in the deepest, darkest underground regions. They are similar in size and appearance to common **Goblins**, but with darker, almost black skin that helps them blend into shadowy environments. **Dark Goblins** are particularly skilled at ambush tactics and prefer to attack from the darkness, using their knowledge of underground terrain to their advantage. They are even more hostile than their surface-dwelling cousins and will attack any intruders into their domain without hesitation.

### Design Notes

Dark Goblins have a base value of 4 (SKILL 2 + STAMINA 2), which is 4 points below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 4 additional design points (10 total instead of 6), matching the Common Goblin's skill set. Their darker skin and specialization in ambush tactics make them particularly effective in shadowy underground environments, though they share the same base characteristics and design point allocation as their common cousins. Their enhanced stealth capabilities and knowledge of deep underground terrain are reflected in their racial special skills.
