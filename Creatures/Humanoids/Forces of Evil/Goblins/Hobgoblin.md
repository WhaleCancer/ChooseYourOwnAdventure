## Description

Possibly the result of interbreeding between [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md) and [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md), **Hobgoblins** are tall gangling creatures encountered in many wild areas. Unlike [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md), with whom they will sometimes be living, they are not afraid of sunlight, and make fearsome opponents both above and below ground. They are as tall as men, typically dress in tattered clothes and armour stolen from past opponents, and carry swords or spiked clubs. Like their cousins they revel in torture and death, especially where [Elves](../../Forces%20of%20Good/Elves/Wood-Elf.md) are concerned. They are ugly, warty-skinned things, and hate anything that is in the slightest way graceful or pretty.

**Hobgoblins** may be encountered living in primitive settlements in isolated lands, but most of their number serve in the armies of Chaos alongside their inhuman cousins. They are hardy fighters, and may sometimes be encountered leading small companies of **Goblins** or **Orcs** into battle. Despite such a rare gift for discipline, they will just as quickly lose it if faced with an **Elf** or two, and will attack them rabidly without thought for their commands.

### Design Notes

Hobgoblins have a base value of 6 (SKILL 3 + STAMINA 3), which is 2 points below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 2 additional design points (8 total instead of 6), but they use a minimal build. Their starting SKILL of 3 (from creature SKILL 6) and STAMINA of 6 reflect their hybrid nature, being larger than Goblins but similar to Orcs. Their ability to fight both above and below ground, and their lack of fear of sunlight, distinguishes them from standard Goblins. Their hardy fighting nature and leadership abilities are represented by their Melee Combat skill. Their awareness of threats and ability to lead small companies is reflected in their Awareness skill. Their hostile nature and hatred of Elves is reflected in their social class of 0.
