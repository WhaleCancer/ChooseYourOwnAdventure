## Description

Smaller than [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc.md) but just as disgusting, **Goblins** are crude humanoids that are found causing trouble in many lands. They are ugly, brown-skinned beings, about a metre and a half tall, typically dressed in ragged furs, hides and scraps of armour. **Goblins** are evil creatures who delight in enslaving, torturing and killing humans, [Dwarves](../../Dwarves/DWARF.md) and [Elves](../../Elves/). Some still dwell in primitive villages in the wilderness, but most now serve alongside **Orcs**, [Ogres](../../Ogres/OGRE.md) and [Trolls](../../Trolls/) in the inhuman armies of Chaos. Like most of their cousins they prefer to live underground, away from sunlight which annoys them with its brightness.

**Goblins** are typically armed with swords, small axes or throwing-daggers (these hit on a roll of 1-3 on one die, for 3 STAMINA points of damage). They also like making cruel traps for unwary creatures to stumble into. These can include deep pits full of poison-tipped spikes, barbed man-traps and a number of other nasty devices. Each tribe of **Goblins** will be led by a stronger warrior (SKILL 7, STAMINA 6), at the front of any attack.

A variant of **Goblins** known as [Marsh Goblins](Marsh-Goblin.md) exists, adapted to life in swampland environments.
