## Description

**Hill Goblins** are a strong, war-like race of [Goblins](Common-Goblin.md) that live in the Craggen Heights of central Allansia. From their lairs deep within the gullies and chasms of this rocky terrain, they raid down into the surrounding lowlands, hungering not just for loot and pillage but also the berserk desire to fight and slay. **Hill Goblins** are slightly larger than normal **Goblins**, approaching an [Orc](ORC.md) in size, and hold themselves straight-backed and broad-shouldered; some are even bearded, like men or [Dwarves](../../Dwarves/DWARF.md). Their skin is darker in tone, being a deep brown or almost black, their noses are smaller, and their wide mouths are full of sharp teeth. **Hill Goblins** are lanky, long-limbed fiends, clad in scraps of leather, chainmail, and spiked plates of armour. They are disciplined fighters, organized into warbands that can pose a serious threat to even well-armed adventurers.

### Design Notes

Hill Goblins have a base value of 6 (SKILL 3 + STAMINA 3), which is 2 points below the benchmark of 8. To match the Common Goblin's skill set (with Hill Lore replacing Underground Lore), they require 10 design points total. This reflects their war-like nature, larger size, and disciplined fighting abilities compared to their common cousins. Their higher starting STAMINA and characteristic bonus reflect their improved combat prowess and organizational skills developed through generations of warband raiding in the Craggen Heights.
