## Overview

**Ogres** are large, ugly, and violent humanoids related to [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md), [Goblins](../Goblins/Common-Goblin.md), and [Trolls](../Trolls/). They are the true Children of Chaos, a warped and twisted race of large, brutally violent humanoids. The average Ogre stands about two metres tall, though the race is so Chaotic that this can vary up to a metre either way. They are very ugly to look upon, their savage faces lumpy and bestial, and drooling spittle everywhere.

While many Ogres lead solitary lives in isolated caves away from civilization, others have become more civilized (if that is the right word) and serve in the armies of evil sorcerers or noblemen. Various subspecies and hybrids have developed, each with unique characteristics and adaptations.

## Ogre Variants

### [Ogre](OGRE.md)

## Playing Ogres as Characters

Ogre variants can be played as player characters using the Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Edition New Races rules. The following chart compares the different ogre types for character creation:

### Calculating Starting Characteristics

Starting characteristics are calculated from creature statistics using the [New Races rules](../../../../.obsidian/AFF/New-Races.md):

- **Starting SKILL:** Creature SKILL - 3
- **Starting STAMINA:** Creature STAMINA (used as listed)
- **Starting LUCK:** 8 (base value), adjusted if base value (SKILL + STAMINA/2) differs from 8

**Example:** A Half-Ogre has creature SKILL 8 and STAMINA 9:

- Starting SKILL: 8 - 3 = 5
- Starting STAMINA: 9
- Base Value: 5 + (9/2) = 5 + 4 = 9 (1 above benchmark of 8, so starting LUCK reduced to 7)

### Ogre Character Comparison Chart

| Feature | Ogre | Half-Ogre | Sea Ogre |
| ------- | ---- | --------- | -------- |
| **Starting SKILL** | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| **Starting STAMINA** | 9-10 | 9 | 12 |
| **Starting LUCK** | 7-8 | 7 | 7 |
| **Characteristic Bonus** | None | None | None |
| **Final SKILL** | 5 | 5 | 5 |
