## Description

During the Godtime, Hydana the Sea God kidnapped many races to populate his undersea realm, and these in time developed into far more different creatures than their land-bound relatives. One of the rarest of these is the dreaded **Sea Ogre**; a brawny humanoid up to four metres tall, with scaly skin, a finned and bulging-eyed head and huge webbed hands that it uses for grabbing and dismembering its enemies.

**Sea Ogres** subsist on a diet of fish, and whatever else they can catch, with Sea Elves being a particularly favoured delicacy. They are simple, slow-witted beings, who are easily provoked into a murderous rage, and they dwell alone in dark undersea caverns, or among the submerged rocks and boulders of wreck-laden reefs. Occasionally, a **Sea Ogre** will attain a degree of infamy due to its marauding raids on coastal settlements: the ill-starred adventurer Jamut Mantrapper slew such a creature who was menacing the harbour of Port Blacksand, while another **Sea Ogre** of equally fearsome repute is rumoured to dwell within the sunken ruins of Atlantis.

With both [Half-Ogres](Half-Ogre.md) and **Sea Ogres**, there is a 1 in 6 chance that one of them may be a champion, with an extra 5 STAMINA points due to their savagery and experience.
