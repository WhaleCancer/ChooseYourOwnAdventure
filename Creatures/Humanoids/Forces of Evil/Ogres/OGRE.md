## Description

Large, ugly and violent, **Ogres** are foul humanoids related to [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md), [Goblins](../Goblins/Goblin.md) and [Trolls](../../../Trolls/), and a whole host of cross-breeds. **Ogres** are the true Children of Chaos, a warped and twisted race of large, brutally violent humanoids. The average **Ogre**, if there is such a thing, stands about two metres tall, though the race is so Chaotic that this can vary up to a metre either way. They are very ugly to look upon, their savage faces lumpy and bestial, and drooling spittle everywhere. **Ogres** are strong creatures, more than a match for most men, and very skilled with their crude clubs and axes.

In the wild, **Ogres** lead solitary lives in isolated caves away from civilization. These more primitive beings dress in animal skins, and live by hunting. They will attack almost anything or anyone they encounter with surprising ferocity.

These days, however, many **Ogres** are more civilized, if that is the right word, and serve in the armies of evil sorcerers or noblemen. These **Ogres** will be trained and equipped for fighting, with battle-axes, war-hammers and even bows, and may be encountered in bands of up to six. They are either found living solitary lives well away from civilization, or in the retinue of some evil army. Despite such new sophistication, though, **Ogres** are still crude and violent by nature, and delight in the torture and death of smaller beings.

Other types of **Ogres** exist however, such as the two presented here: [Half-Ogres](Half-Ogre.md) and [Sea Ogres](Sea-Ogre.md).
