## Description

Also known as the Fen Beast, the **Grendel** is a fearsome monster that lurks in swamps and marshes across the Old World. Thought to have evolved from a primitive or mutated blood-line of [Ogres](Ogres/OGRE.md), it is a three metre tall humanoid, with a shock of lank, thick green hair atop a face marred by warts and scars. **Grendels** have powerful, clawed hands that they use to tear apart their prey, and their hide is tough enough to provide some protection in combat. They are solitary hunters, preferring to ambush their victims from the murky depths of their marshland homes. **Grendels** are known for their ferocity and will attack any creature that ventures too close to their territory, making them a dangerous threat to travelers and adventurers alike.
