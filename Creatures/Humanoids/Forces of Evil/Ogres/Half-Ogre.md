## Description

Similar to [Man-Orcs](../Orcs/Man-Orc.md), **Half-Ogres** are a shunned race of hybrid creatures; part [Ogre](OGRE.md) and (usually) part human. Their bestial misshapen appearance, with greenish-brown skin and bulky muscular limbs covered in wiry tufts of black hair, often spells their exile from most human settlements, except for lawless borderland cities, such as Kharé or Ashkyos. Here they will be found working as gladiators, mercenaries, and torturers, and armed with a variety of club-like weapons including great studded maces and claw-toothed warhammers.

Some **Half-Ogre** torturers also favour using the whip, preferred weapon of one of their Ogre heroes: Naggamanteh, Master Torturer to the Archmage of Mampang. Incidentally, the rules for using a whip are: roll one die at the start of each Attack Round. A roll of 1 means the **Half-Ogre** has snared their opponent with the whip, and the victim must deduct 3 SKILL points for the next three Attack Rounds while they fight themselves free. Following in Naggamanteh's legendary footsteps was Mehrabian the Torturer, a **Half-Ogre** who dwelled within the Iron Crypts on the Isle of Despair, until, rumour has it, he was dispatched by a Fire Globe Spell cast by one of his prisoners, the wizard Alsander.

With both **Half-Ogres** and [Sea Ogres](Sea-Ogre.md), there is a 1 in 6 chance that one of them may be a champion, with an extra 5 STAMINA points due to their savagery and experience.

### Design Notes

Half-Ogres have a base value of 9 (SKILL 5 + STAMINA 4), which is 1 point above the benchmark of 8. This results in starting LUCK being reduced to 7, and they have fewer design points available (5 total instead of 6). Their starting SKILL of 5 (from creature SKILL 8) and STAMINA of 9 reflect their hybrid nature, being larger and stronger than humans but smaller than full Ogres. Their +1 damage modifier is represented by the Strongarm talent. Their work as gladiators, mercenaries, and torturers is reflected in their Melee Combat skill. Their need to be aware of threats in their dangerous profession is represented by their Awareness skill. Their shunned and exiled status is reflected in their social class of 0. Their average-high intelligence allows them to work in various professions despite their appearance.
