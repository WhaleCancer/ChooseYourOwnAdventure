## Description

The **Blood Orcs** of Trolltooth Pass, and elsewhere in north-western Allansia, were first formed by the necromancer Zharradan Marr, and his dabbling in the forbidden art of marrangha, or creature creation. They are slightly smaller than normal [Orcs](Orc.md), but more powerfully built, and their heads are topped by two curved horns, while a row of spikes runs down their backs. **Blood Orcs** have gnarled, pug-nosed faces, with powerful jaws full of vicious teeth. Indeed, their name comes from the fact that even when unarmed, they will simply attack their enemies by biting them repeatedly with their savage fangs. More usually, they will wield swords and longbows in combat.

During the Trolltooth Wars, Zharradan Marr used them as foot-soldiers in units alongside monsters such as Manic Beasts and Devourers, for they are apparently even stupider than average **Orcs**. Having said that, **Blood Orcs** did play a prominent role in attacking the great flying ship Galleykeep, while armed with bows and mounted on Tooki War Griffins, so their battle-capabilities are excellent. Their tribal connections are not as strong as regular **Orcs**, and as a result **Blood Orcs** these days are often found in small groups, working as mercenaries for whoever will hire them.

### Design Notes

Blood Orcs have a base value of 7 (SKILL 4 + STAMINA 3), which is 1 point below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 1 additional design point (7 total instead of 6), but they require 8 points for their full specialized build. Their higher starting STAMINA (7) and characteristic bonus reflect their powerfully built nature. The Bite Attack talent represents their savage fangs, and their Bow skill reflects their excellent battle-capabilities with longbows. Their mercenary nature is reflected in their Awareness skill.
