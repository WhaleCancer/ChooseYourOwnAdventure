## Description

Similar to normal [Orcs](Orc.md) in general appearance, **Pygmy Orcs** are much smaller in size, shorter even than [Goblins](../Goblins/Goblin.md)! What they lack in physical strength however, they more than make up for in dexterity and skill, for **Pygmy Orcs** are a race that has been specially bred for burglary and assassination. Those engaged in clandestine missions will be well equipped with ropes, grappling hooks, daggers and blowpipes. The latter use poisoned darts, which are tipped with a fast-acting poison that kills instantly if it hits (and requires a Test for Luck roll to avoid).

The leader of a band of **Pygmy Orc** assassins is experienced and powerful, with SKILL 7 STAMINA 10. Other **Pygmy Orcs** are often employed as soldiers, for they can be tough to defeat, and wield short swords and maces in combat. They are found mainly in north-eastern Khul, from Ashkyos to Corda, sometimes as members of the local thieves' guilds, but more normally in the employ of evil masters such as Morgana of Krill Garnash or Arachnos the Life-Stealer.
