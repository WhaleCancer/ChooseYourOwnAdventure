## Description

The **Sniffer Orcs** are a legendary race of [Orcs](Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md) from south-western Khul, where, as their name suggests, they are famed for their ability to follow any track or trail, across rocks, through water, and over any terrain. Relentless pursuers of prey, they are tall, lithe creatures, usually clad in leather and brandishing short swords or hand-axes. **Sniffer Orcs** are thought to have been originally bred in some southern hellhole, such as the Dark Chasms below the kingdom of Gorak, or the Chaos-tainted tunnels that burrow beneath the ruined city of Zagoula, where their tracking skills came in handy in those lightless depths. Since then, many of them have relocated to the surface of Khul, and any warlord or despot worthy of the name has a stable of **Sniffer Orcs**, and similar creatures like Snuff Hounds, ready to send out in search of fugitives and members of local resistance militias. These long-nosed **Orcs** are usually equipped with ropes, manacles, and other tools for capturing their quarry alive.
