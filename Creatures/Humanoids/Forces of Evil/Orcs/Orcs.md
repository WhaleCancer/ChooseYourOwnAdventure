## Overview

**Orcs** are one of the most numerous of the evil humanoid races found across Titan, serving alongside [Goblins](../Goblins/Common-Goblin.md), [Ogres](../Ogres/OGRE.md), and [Trolls](../Trolls/) in the armies of Chaos. They are squat, ugly brutes, shorter than humans but taller than Goblins, with warty brown-green skins and vile habits. Orcs are disgusting, filthy creatures who delight in the pain of others and will torture captives before setting them to work as slaves.

Various orc subspecies have developed through mutations, selective breeding, or adaptation to different environments. Some variants have stabilized into entirely new races, each with unique characteristics suited to their specific habitats or purposes.

## Playing Orcs as Characters

All orc variants can be played as player characters using the Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Edition New Races rules. The following chart compares the different orc types for character creation:

### Calculating Starting Characteristics

Starting characteristics are calculated from creature statistics using the [New Races rules](../../../../.obsidian/AFF/New-Races.md):

- **Starting SKILL:** Creature SKILL - 3
- **Starting STAMINA:** Creature STAMINA (used as listed)
- **Starting LUCK:** 8 (base value), adjusted if base value (SKILL + STAMINA/2) differs from 8

**Example:** A Common Orc has creature SKILL 6 and STAMINA 5:

- Starting SKILL: 6 - 3 = 3
- Starting STAMINA: 5
- Base Value: 3 + (5/2) = 3 + 2 = 5 (3 below benchmark of 8, so starting LUCK remains 8)
