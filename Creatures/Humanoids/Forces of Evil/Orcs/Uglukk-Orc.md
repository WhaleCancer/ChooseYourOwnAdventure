## Description

**Uglukk Orcs** are considered to be one of the foulest of the Orcish races, if that is at all possible. Tall, powerful and extremely violent, they think nothing of using all the dirty tricks and cowardly ruses at their disposal in order to win the day. **Uglukk Orcs** are ugly brutes, with warty green-brown skin, fanged mouths, pointed ears and sunken red eyes. They look disgusting and smell like they have never washed in their lives. An **Uglukk Orc** will typically be clad in a heavy chainmail hauberk and they prefer to wield crushing weapons like maces and battle axes. They are particularly feared for their brutality and lack of honour, often attacking from ambush or using overwhelming numbers to ensure victory.

### Design Notes

Uglukk Orcs have a base value of 9 (SKILL 5 + STAMINA 4), which is 1 point above the benchmark of 8. This results in starting LUCK being reduced to 7, and they have fewer design points available (5 total instead of 6). Their high starting SKILL (5) and STAMINA (8) reflect their tall, powerful, and extremely violent nature. Their preference for dirty tricks and ambush tactics is represented by their Sneaking and Awareness skills. Their lack of honour and brutality are reflected in their lower social class and reduced design points.
