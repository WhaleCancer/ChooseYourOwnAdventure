## Description

Heavily armoured, mangy, and ferocious – these are the **Mountain Orc** tribes that patrol the craggy highlands of Titan, from the Icefinger Mountains in northern Allansia to the Witchtooth Line that separates the kingdoms of Gallantaria and Femphrey. They are a battle-hardened bunch, favouring swords, axes, and spears in hand-to-hand combat, and longbows armed with stubby Orcish arrows for picking off long-range targets. **Mountain Orc** leadership is a fractious affair, and usually a two-way power struggle between the chief, who is the strongest or smartest warrior, and the shaman, who may have magical powers, or may simply know a lot of ancient Orcish lore (or at least pretend to). Other important positions within the tribe include the war-leader, who commands the warriors in battle, and the scout-master, who coordinates the tribe's raiding parties and reconnaissance missions.

### Design Notes

Mountain Orcs have a base value of 8 (SKILL 5 + STAMINA 3), which exactly matches the benchmark of 8. This grants them the standard 6 design points, but they require 8 points for their full specialized build. Their high starting SKILL (5) and STAMINA (7) reflect their battle-hardened nature and ferocity. Their mountain adaptation is reflected in their Survivor (mountains/hills) talent and Mountain Lore skill. Their preference for swords, axes, spears, and longbows is represented by their Bow skill and combat focus. Their higher intelligence (Average-High) and organized tribal structure are reflected in their Awareness skill.
