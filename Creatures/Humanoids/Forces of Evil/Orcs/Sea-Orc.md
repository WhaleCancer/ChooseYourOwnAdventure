## Description

**Sea Orcs** are a maritime variant of [Orcs](Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md) that have adapted to life on and around the seas. They are similar in build to common **Orcs** but with webbed hands and feet that aid in swimming. **Sea Orcs** are often found as pirates, raiders, or crew members on ships, where their natural aggression and strength make them effective fighters. They prefer coastal settlements and port towns where they can easily access both land and sea. **Sea Orcs** are known for their use of whips in combat, which they can use to snare opponents or cause painful lacerations. They are just as hostile as their land-dwelling cousins, but their maritime lifestyle has given them a slightly more organized and disciplined approach to warfare.
