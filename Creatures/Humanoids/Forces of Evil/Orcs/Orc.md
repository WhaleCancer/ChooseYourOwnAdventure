## Description

Along with [Goblins](../Goblins/Common-Goblin.md), **Orcs** are probably the most numerous of all the races that comprise the Children of Hashak, and are found in every conceivable corner of Titan. For the most part, **Orcs** vary little in appearance, save whatever mutations the warping powers of Chaos might throw up. Occasionally however, some mutated or crudely spawned **Orcs** stabilize into entirely new races of creatures, and three of these are presented here: [Blood Orcs](Blood-Orc.md), [Pygmy Orcs](Pygmy-Orc.md), and [Swamp Orcs](Swamp-Orc.md).

## Orcs as Characters

**Source:** AFF Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed - New Races Rules

### Design Point Allocation (5 points total)

- Languages: Free (not counted)
- +1 STAMINA bonus: 2 points
- Dark Seeing (Minor Talent): 2 points
- 2 Racial Special Skills: 2 points
- **Total: 5 points** (2 points remaining)

### Design Notes

Orcs have a base value of 7 (SKILL 4 + STAMINA 3), which is 1 point below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 1 additional design point (7 total instead of 6), but they use a minimal build. Their starting SKILL of 4 (from creature SKILL 7) and STAMINA of 7 reflect their position as stronger and tougher than Goblins. The +1 STAMINA bonus reflects their toughness and resilience. Their evil nature and preference for underground regions are reflected in their skill set and lower social class.
