## Description

There is a breed of [Orc](Orc.md) that lives only in dank, gloomy places; by underground pools, or in tracts of fly-blown wetlands. Known as **Swamp Orcs**, or Marsh Orcs, they dwell in crude settlements of dilapidated huts on stilts that perch precariously above the muck and mire. **Swamp Orcs** are gaunt, brown-skinned humanoids, clad in ragged hides and armed with swords, tridents, and their favourite arrows. They eat mainly fish and swamp fungus (such as Red-Spotted Toadstools), and they consider poisonous snakes a delicacy.

**Swamp Orcs** can be found in suitable habitat across Titan, from the Swamplands of Silur Cha, where they serve in the armies of the Lizard Man Empire, to the beast-haunted Scorpion Swamp, where the depredations of the local **Swamp Orc** tribes have gathered them much infamy. More often than not however, their villages will be tucked away in some quiet corner of the bog-lands, eking out an existence far-removed from the greater troubles of the world at large.

### Design Notes

Swamp Orcs have a base value of 7 (SKILL 4 + STAMINA 3), which is 1 point below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 1 additional design point (7 total instead of 6), but they require 8 points for their full specialized build. Their swamp adaptation is reflected in their Survivor talent and Swamp Lore skill. Their gaunt, brown-skinned appearance and preference for tridents and bows are represented in their skill set. Their higher STAMINA reflects their resilience in harsh swamp environments.
