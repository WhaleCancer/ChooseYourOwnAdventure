## Description

On one side there are the forces of Good � humans, [Elves](../../Elves/) and [Dwarves](../../Dwarves/DWARF.md). On the other there are the forces of Evil � [Goblins](../Goblins/Goblin.md), [Ogres](../../Ogres/OGRE.md), [Trolls](../../Trolls/) and **Orcs**. Of all the noxious inhuman creatures an adventurer must overcome during his quests for fame and fortune, **Orcs** will always be the most frequent of his adversaries. **Orcs** infest almost everywhere, though they prefer dark underground regions: like **Goblins**, they dislike sunlight. They are squat, ugly brutes, shorter than a man, but taller than a **Goblin**. They have warty brown-green skins, usually covered in a motley assortment of skins, furs and irregular scraps of armour scavenged from previous opponents. Their favourite weapons are serrated swords, whips, flails, morning stars and spears.

**Orcs** are disgusting, filthy creatures with vile habits to match. They delight in the pain of others, even weaker members of their own race, and they will torture their captives before setting them to work as slaves. The living-quarters of an **Orc** stronghold will be knee-deep in filth and muck, and will be very unhealthy, to say the least. **Orcs** delight in unsavoury activities. Their favourite food, for example, is a rare dish called Elf intestines in Gnome's-blood sauce, though when this is out of season they have to settle for more mundane delights like rat-gizzard soup, or curried bat surprise.

The armies of the **Orcs** are led by [Great Orcs](Great-Orc.md). Larger and stronger than common **Orcs**, they are possibly the result of selective breeding with **Trolls**. If more than four **Orcs** are encountered, one of them will be a **Great Orc**. If one is present, it will keep the rest from squabbling and brawling with one another. **Orcs** are argumentative beasts, who seem to spend more of their time fighting among themselves than against the dreaded **Elves** and **Dwarves**.

Like all the Chaotic races, some unfortunate **Orcs** are mutants, with an amazing assortment of deficiencies. They may have strange skins, elongated or shortened limbs, or special powers, such as flying, telepathy and so on. Most mutants are despised by more normal **Orcs**, who treat them as if they were slaves, or mangy dogs suitable only for kicking and beating.

### Design Notes

Orcs have a base value of 5 (SKILL 3 + STAMINA 2), which is 3 points below the benchmark of 8. This grants them 3 additional design points (9 total instead of 6), but they use a minimal build reflecting their brutish nature. Their starting SKILL of 3 (from creature SKILL 6) reflects their position as stronger than Goblins but less skilled than many other races. The +1 STAMINA bonus reflects their toughness and resilience. Their evil nature and underground preference are reflected in their skill set and lower social class.
