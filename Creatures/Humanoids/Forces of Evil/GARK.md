## Description

In the huge vats of dungeon-like laboratories deep below the
surface of the earth, evil sorcerers have long experimented
with cross-breeding the various inhuman races – Orcs, Gob-
lins, Ogres, Trolls and Giants. Combining Orc and Troll they
have produced the warlike Doragar; mixing Goblin and
Giant they created the GARK.
They look very much like a huge Goblin, well over two and
a half metres tall. They are lithe, muscular and very aggres-
sive. Their brown hides are tough and leathery, and they can
prove to be formidable warriors with axes and cleavers. They
are not overly intelligent, however, and can sometimes be
very unpredictable, especially in the heat of battle. In the
colonies of Goblins and Orcs in which they dwell, they will
usually be found on guard-duty in some forgotten corner
where they cannot damage anything. Garks are attracted to
pretty, sparkling things, and they may possess whole trunks
full of worthless trinkets that have caught their eye.
