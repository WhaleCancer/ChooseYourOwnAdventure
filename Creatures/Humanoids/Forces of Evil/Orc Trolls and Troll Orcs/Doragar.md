## Description

In the fetid darkness deep underground, evil creatures mine ore and beat metal on anvils, ever preparing for war. [Orcs](Forces%20of%20Evil/Orcs/Orc.md), [Ogres](Ogres/OGRE.md) and [Trolls](../Trolls/) hone their weapons, repair their chainmail and shields, and ready the **Doragar** with battle-songs and strong liquor. **Doragar** are the shock troops of the forces of Chaos, berserk warriors which lead the howling rabble into battle. The result of careful interbreeding between **Orcs** and **Trolls**, they are brutish, ignorant beings, useful only for wielding a pick or an axe. In rare times of peace, they are set to work in the mines, where their strong bodies enable them to work twice as fast as their **Orc** cousins. When the tribes gather to raid the rich cities of men, **Doragar** are equipped with bizarrely spiked armour and huge serrated weapons, and pushed into the front lines.

The brutes stand about two metres tall, and are almost as wide. Their bodies are leathery and muscular, and their strength is prodigious. Their heads are very much like those of **Orcs** or **Trolls**, with large ragged ears and tusk-like teeth. Their hair, however, is long and luxuriant, more of a mane than a growth. **Doragar** are immensely proud of their rather incongruous hair, plaiting it endlessly and hanging bones and stolen trinkets from its ragged tresses. The creatures dress in armour welded from large metal plates and decorated with spikes and studs, which they use as offensive weapons, impaling their enemies on them in the press of battle. Like the **Doragar** themselves, their weapons are large and cruel, made without thought for the grace and skill of fighting.
