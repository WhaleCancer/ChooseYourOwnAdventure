## Description

The armies of the [Orcs](Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md) are led by **Great Orcs**. Larger and stronger than common **Orcs**, they are possibly the result of selective breeding with [Trolls](../../../Trolls/). If more than four **Orcs** are encountered, one of them will be a **Great Orc**. If one is present, it will keep the rest from squabbling and brawling with one another.

**Great Orcs** share the same vile habits and disgusting nature as their smaller cousins, but their greater size and strength make them even more dangerous in combat. They are typically armed with the same weapons as common **Orcs** - serrated swords, whips, flails, morning stars and spears - but wield them with greater skill and power. **Great Orcs** serve as leaders and enforcers within Orc tribes, maintaining discipline among the normally argumentative and fractious **Orcs** through their physical dominance and authority.
