## Description

Unlike Doragar or Great Orcs, which stem from older Trollish lineages, **Troll-Orcs** are believed to be a more recent hybrid of [Orc](Orc.md) and [Common Troll](../../../Trolls/COMMON-TROLL.md), bred in the great dungeons of Arachnos the Life-Stealer. They combine the cunning of **Orcs** with the brute strength and resilience of **Trolls**, making them formidable opponents. **Troll-Orcs** are larger than common **Orcs** but smaller than full **Trolls**, with the greenish skin and brutish features of both parent races. They are skilled with ranged weapons, particularly longbows and blowpipes, which they use to harry enemies before closing for melee combat. **Troll-Orcs** are particularly dangerous in forest and marsh environments where they can use their knowledge of the terrain to set up ambushes.
