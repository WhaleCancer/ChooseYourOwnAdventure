## Description

SEA TROLLS dwell in large bodies of water, from deep
oceans to inland lakes. They have scaly green skins, webbed
hands and feet, and gills in their necks, but otherwise look
much like Cave Trolls. They live on fish, but occasionally
manage to overturn a boat or pluck a tasty human from a
riverbank. They can only survive in air for a few minutes, but
that is usually enough for them to grab someone with their
claws, bite deeply into his neck, and leap back into the water
with him. They are hated by Merfolk, who will try to kill the
things if they stray too near to their territory. Sea Trolls make
their lairs in underwater caves, often hiding them with weed
for protection. Inside there may be many relics of their past
victims, both bones and treasure.
