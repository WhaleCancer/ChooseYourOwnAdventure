## Description

The interminable wars between the Dwarfs and the HILL
TROLLS have continued since before history was recorded,
for the two races loathe each other. Hill Trolls are warlike
beings, who provide endless hazards to travellers and set-
tlers in the higher regions. They are the largest of all Trolls,
usually dressed in furs and leathers, their long hair braided
with bones and jewellery. Their favourite weapons are
spears and battle-axes, and they also use shields and odd
scraps of armour to protect themselves. They dwell in tribal
villages high in the hills, from where they can sweep down
into the valleys to attack the settlements of Dwarfs and
humans alike.
