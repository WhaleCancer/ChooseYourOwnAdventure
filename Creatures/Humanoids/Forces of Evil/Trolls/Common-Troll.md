## Description

Once living in the wilderness like Orcs, COMMON TROLLS
are mostly found in the armies of Evil, where they can prac-
tise their favourite hobbies against puny humans. There are
still a few primitive tribes of Common Trolls living in rough
villages in the wildlands, but even they are considerably
more civilized (as Trolls go) than the average Hill or Cave
Troll. If a more primitive Common Troll is encountered, its
SKILL should be reduced by 2, for it will not have had the
benefit of military training. Whatever their circumstances,
Common Trolls are usually large and fat, taller than a human
by about a head, with ugly faces and muscular limbs. They
are gruff and surly creatures, but they enjoy jokes in which
other beings get severely injured. Their favourite weapons
are large battle-axes and war-hammers.
