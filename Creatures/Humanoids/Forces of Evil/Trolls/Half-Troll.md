## Description

Thought by some to be the first Children of Hashak the Creator, **Trolls** have spread across Titan where they toil alongside their lesser brethren, the [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md) and [Goblins](../Goblins/Common-Goblin.md), in the armies of Chaos and Evil.

The **Half-Troll**, as its name unfortunately suggests, is part-human and part-Troll. Burly, brawny creatures, Half-Trolls are around the same size as a normal Troll, but with more hair, a leaner physique, and, for a Troll, above-average intelligence. They are often found working in a variety of physically demanding jobs, such as bodyguards, blacksmiths, bouncers, and mercenaries. Half-Trolls usually arm themselves with axes, swords, and stone clubs, and wear whatever scraps of leather armour fit their twisted frames.

Incredibly, some scheming creatures even rise to positions of power, and these individuals may have scores of SKILL 11 STAMINA 14. One such Half-Troll was the legendary Thugruff, who served as Battlemaster of the Testing Grounds, for the necromancer Zharradan Marr, leading his legionaries during the epic Trolltooth Wars that wracked central Allansia.

## Half-Trolls as Characters

**Source:** AFF Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed - New Races Rules

Half-Trolls can be played as player characters using the following racial profile:

### Starting Profile

- **SKILL:** 7
- **STAMINA:** 12
- **LUCK:** 7

### Characteristic Bonuses

- None (base value above benchmark, LUCK reduced)

### Starting Talents

- **Dark Seeing** (Minor Talent) - Can see in complete darkness
- **Strongarm** (Minor Talent) - +1 to damage rolls

### Racial Special Skills

- **Awareness**

### Languages (Free)

- **Native:** Trollish (or Orcish)
- **Common:** Common Tongue

### Special Skill Choices

One Special Skill at 2 points, Four Special Skills at 1 point

### Social Class

0 or 1 (Half-Trolls are generally unfriendly and rarely accepted in civilized society, though more so than full Trolls)

### Design Point Allocation (5 points total)

- Languages: Free (not counted)
- Dark Seeing (Minor Talent): 2 points
- Strongarm (Minor Talent): 2 points
- 1 Racial Special Skill: 1 point
- **Total: 5 points**

### Design Notes

Half-Trolls have a base value of 13 (SKILL 7 + STAMINA 6), which is 5 points above the benchmark of 8. This results in starting LUCK being reduced to 7 (8 - 5 = 3, but minimum is 7), and they have fewer design points available (1 point instead of 6, creating a -4 point deficit). Their high starting SKILL (7) and STAMINA (12) reflect their burly, brawny nature and hybrid heritage. The Strongarm talent represents their +1 damage modifier. Their above-average intelligence (Average-High) and ability to work in various jobs is reflected in their Awareness skill and slightly better social acceptance than full Trolls. The negative design point balance results in fewer special skill choices (One at 2 points, Four at 1 point instead of the standard Three at 2 points, Six at 1 point).
