## Description

Violent, stupid, and thus very dangerous, CAVE TROLLS
are the most primitive of all Troll races. They tend to be
leaner than other Trolls, their bodies lithe and muscular with
long arms that end in sharpened claws. They are uglier, if
that is possible, than Common Trolls, and their teeth are far
larger, sticking out more like tusks from their drooling
mouths. They are solitary, unsociable creatures, usually
found hiding from daylight in a dark cave or passage deep
underground. They are exclusively carnivorous and delight
in the tender flesh of humans, but more often have to settle
for stringy rat meat. Their favourite weapons are clubs and
long knives, though their talons are just as effective. They
hoard shiny items, attracted by their glitter, and their lairs
may be crammed with all manner of glinting things, some
valuable.
