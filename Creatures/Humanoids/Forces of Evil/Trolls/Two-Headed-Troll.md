## Description

The **Two-Headed Troll** is another powerful variety of Troll, whose twin heads are thought to be an affliction of Chaos (and often accompanied by other mutations such as tails, horns, and spikes). Standing close to three metres tall, it is a violent and very dangerous creature, whose wart-covered faces are distended by drooling, tusk-laden mouths.

Surprisingly, or perhaps not given we are dealing with a Troll, the creatures' twin brains do not impart any increase in intelligence, and the Two-Headed Troll is about as stupid as a [Cave Troll](Cave-Troll.md). It is incredibly strong however, and will cause double damage on a roll of a 1 or 2 on one die for every time it hits its opponent in combat.

In addition, the Two-Headed Troll is devoted to its weaponry, and will often be found lovingly honing a razor-sharp battle axe, or polishing the spikes of flint on a stone-headed club. Most of the time these creatures are encountered living a solitary existence in some forgotten dungeon or wilderness cave, until chanced upon by a luckless adventurer. If they overpower their prey, the Two-Headed Troll will then commence a long argument with itself as to the best method of preparing their victim for dinner.

### Design Notes

Two-Headed Trolls have a base value of 13 (SKILL 7 + STAMINA 6), which is 5 points above the benchmark of 8. This results in starting LUCK being reduced to 7, and they have fewer design points available (1 point instead of 6, creating a -6 point deficit). Their high starting SKILL (7) and STAMINA (12) reflect their incredible strength and size (close to three metres tall). The Double Damage talent represents their ability to cause double damage on a roll of 1-2. Their low intelligence and solitary nature are reflected in their minimal skill set and social class of 0. The negative design point balance results in fewer special skill choices (One at 2 points, Four at 1 point instead of the standard Three at 2 points, Six at 1 point).
