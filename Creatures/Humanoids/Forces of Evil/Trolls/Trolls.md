## Overview

**Trolls** are thought by some to be the first Children of Hashak the Creator, and have spread across Titan where they toil alongside their lesser brethren, the [Orcs](../Orcs/Orc-Out-of-the-Pit.md) and [Goblins](../Goblins/Common-Goblin.md), in the armies of Chaos and Evil. Trolls are large, powerful humanoids, typically taller than humans, with ugly faces, muscular limbs, and a reputation for violence and stupidity.

Various troll subspecies have developed through adaptation to different environments or through mutations and selective breeding. Common races, including Cave Trolls and Hill Trolls, are well-known to any adventurer of standing, but there are also more obscure types of Trolls lurking in dark corners throughout the three major continents and beyond.

## Playing Trolls as Characters

All troll variants can be played as player characters using the Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Edition New Races rules. The following chart compares the different troll types for character creation:

### Calculating Starting Characteristics

Starting characteristics are calculated from creature statistics using the [New Races rules](../../../../.obsidian/AFF/New-Races.md):

- **Starting SKILL:** Creature SKILL - 3
- **Starting STAMINA:** Creature STAMINA (used as listed)
- **Starting LUCK:** 8 (base value), adjusted if base value (SKILL + STAMINA/2) differs from 8

**Example:** A Common Troll has creature SKILL 9 and STAMINA 9:

- Starting SKILL: 9 - 3 = 6
- Starting STAMINA: 9
- Base Value: 6 + (9/2) = 6 + 4 = 10 (2 above benchmark of 8, so starting LUCK reduced to 7)
