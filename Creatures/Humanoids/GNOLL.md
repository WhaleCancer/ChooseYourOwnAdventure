## Description

Evil lurks in many forms across Titan, from demon-summoning sorcerers of the dark arts to bands of cutthroats skulking about in hillside caves ready to rob the next caravan that passes their way. An example of the latter are the **Gnolls**, a scavenger race of tall, sinewy humanoids with the bodies of men and the faces of hyenas!

Clad in scraps of leather and brandishing spiked clubs and curved scimitars, Gnolls are not especially numerous but they are widespread, being found across Titan in a variety of terrain. They are often drawn to lawless human settlements where they can prey upon the weak and unwary. Gnolls are opportunistic raiders and bandits, preferring to ambush travelers and caravans rather than engage in open warfare. Their hyena-like features give them an unnerving appearance, and their laughter-like calls can be heard echoing through the hills and caves where they make their lairs.

Gnolls are cunning and organized enough to work in small bands, coordinating their attacks to maximize their chances of success. They have little regard for the lives of others and will readily kill for loot or food. Despite their scavenger nature, they are skilled fighters and can be quite dangerous when cornered or when they have the advantage of numbers.
