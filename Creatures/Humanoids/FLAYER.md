## Description

It is widely believed in educated circles that FLAYERS are
somehow related to the ghastly Brain Slayers. Certainly there
are many physical similarities between the two races. Flayers
have a humanoid body and legs, though they lack arms. Their

heads are octopus-like, with a dense fringe of thin prehensile
tentacles. Unlike a Brain Slayer, however, their skin is not
solid, but is more like grey jelly, which quivers repulsively
with every movement. They dress in tatty clothes.
Flayers are rarely seen by men, preferring to secrete them-
selves away from the attentions of other races. However, it
has been discovered that they have somehow developed
extraordinary skill at preparing some of the most bizarre, but
also the tastiest, dishes. As a result, a Flayer may sometimes
be encountered in the unlikely surroundings of a well
equipped kitchen, cooking weird and wonderful meals for
the nobleman who can afford to employ it. Their disgusting
appearance, though, often causes other creatures and hu-
mans to hate and eventually attack them. The reaction they
receive from other beings has made the Flayers sad and shy
creatures, wary of others and quick to defend themselves. In
a fight, a Flayer will whip its head violently from side to side,
slashing the air with its tentacles. Each is equipped with a
barbed sting that allows it to cause 3 points of damage for a
successful hit, instead of the usual 2.
