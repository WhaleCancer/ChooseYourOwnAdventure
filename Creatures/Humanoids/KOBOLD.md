## Description

**Kobolds** are an ugly black-hearted misbegotten race of creatures, being brown-skinned hybrids whose ancestry is a tangled mass of [Orc](Forces%20of%20Evil/Orcs/Orc.md), [Goblin](Forces%20of%20Evil/Goblins/Goblin.md), [Hobgoblin](Forces%20of%20Evil/Goblins/Hobgoblin.md) and [Troll](../Trolls/) lineages. Some claim they are descended from a now-extinct race of semi-sentient creatures called Korgar, who were first created by the evil sorcerer Axion. Other sages argue their origins are older still, as evidenced by their wide distribution across the face of Titan.

**Kobolds** are small, wiry humanoids, typically standing about a metre tall. Despite their small size, they are fierce fighters and cunning trap-makers. They are particularly skilled at creating deadly devices to protect their underground lairs, including pit traps, falling rocks, and poisoned darts. **Kobolds** are known for their cowardly nature when alone, but when in groups they become bold and aggressive, using their numbers to overwhelm opponents. They are often found in mines and underground complexes, where they work as miners or guards for more powerful evil creatures.
