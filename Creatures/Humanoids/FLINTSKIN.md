## Description

**Flintskins** are a hardy, intelligent humanoid race that dwells in the wild, untamed regions of Titan. Their name derives from their tough, flint-like skin that provides natural protection and their mastery of flint-working for tools and weapons.

**Flintskins** are skilled hunters and warriors, typically armed with spears, handaxes, or longbows - weapons well-suited to their wilderness lifestyle. They wear light leather cuirasses for additional protection while maintaining the mobility needed for their nomadic or semi-nomadic existence. Despite their primitive appearance, **Flintskins** are highly intelligent, making them cunning opponents and capable strategists.

These humanoids are typically encountered in small hunting parties of 2-7 individuals, or in larger tribal bands of 6-36 when traveling or gathering for important events. They are naturally wary of strangers, reacting with neutrality at best and unfriendliness at worst to those who enter their territories uninvited.

**Flintskins** make their homes in marshes, hills, and other wilderness areas where they can live in relative isolation from the more civilized races. They are territorial and protective of their hunting grounds, but are not inherently hostile - those who approach with respect and peaceful intentions may find them to be valuable allies or trading partners. However, those who threaten their lands or people will quickly discover that **Flintskins** are formidable warriors who know their terrain well.
