## Description

The swamps and jungles of the south-east are home to many
strange tribes. One race, known as the KOKOMOKOA, are a
major menace to trappers and adventurers in the area. Stand-
ing a little over a metre high, these squat, green-skinned
humanoids seem reptilian, because of their scaly skin and
webbed feet. Their heads are wide and flat, their eyes large
and yellow. They can swim well, their long, bony legs pro-
pelling them swiftly just below the surface with only their
large eyes breaking the water.
Kokomokoa, so called because of their ululating war-cries,
live together in compact family groups, in huts woven from
rushes and covered in hardened mud. These crude dwellings
are very difficult to find, camouflaged as they are to blend
with the surrounding vegetation, and act as secure bases
from which the tribes mount raids over the area. Sometimes,
Kokomokoa will train Giant Marsh Spiders as sentries, to
watch over their females and young while the warriors hunt
for food.
In an attack, Kokomokoa will often use nets (hitting on a roll
of a 1 or 2 on one die), which hold down their prey, while
others spear it with their short bamboo javelins (since the
nets will temporarily remove 3 points from their captive's
SKIL L). Once captured, their victims can expect only to be
boiled and eaten. Kokomokoa are particularly enamoured of
Elves' flesh, which they consider a great delicacy, and great
celebrations are held on the rare occasions when such meat
is on their menu after a particularly successful raid! These
grisly cannibals have no need of treasure or money, but
many keep pretty gems, since they are attracted by their
sparkle.
