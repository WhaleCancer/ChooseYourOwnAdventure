## Description

The sorry mongrel offspring of [Orcs](Orc.md) and humans, **Man-Orcs** are shunned by both races. They look very much like humans, but much uglier, with large teeth and ears and ruddy-brown skins. They may be found living alone in towns or the countryside, but in more isolated areas there are small farming villages of **Man-Orcs**, such as Torrepani in the Shamutanti Hills. **Man-Orcs** are unfriendly towards humans, for most of them remember beatings and stonings at their hands. **Orcs** despise them and treat them as worthless slaves to be whipped and abused, and eventually cast out or even killed. As a result **Man-Orcs** live a lonely existence, scraping a living out of the earth, well away from other beings who might harm them.
