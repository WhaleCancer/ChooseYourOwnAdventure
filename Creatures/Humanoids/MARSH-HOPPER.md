## Description

Related to the Kokomokoa of the south-eastern jungles,
MARSH HOPPERS are small amphibian humanoids which
dwell in the marshes of Fire Island and western Allansia.
Standing about one and a half metres tall, they have large
heads, with huge, almost sad eyes and wide mouths. Their
bodies are small in comparison, and covered in green scales.
Their arms are long and very dextrous, their legs shorter and
ending in wide, webbed feet. Cunning in the extreme, they
know the marshes backwards, and will often appear to aid
lost adventurers. However, they will really lead them into the
lairs of larger monsters such as Slime Suckers or Hydras in
return for a few left-over scraps of meat. Marsh Hoppers live
in small, isolated family groups, hidden deep in the swamps
well away from larger predators. The nimble creatures often
roam far and wide across the marshland, however, searching
for a suitable meal. They usually live on fish, frogs and other
small creatures, but their cunning minds occasionally bring
them a far richer feast!
