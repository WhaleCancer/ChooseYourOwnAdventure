## Description

GREMLINS are tiny humanoids found lurking in under-
ground caverns where they live off small insects and ani-
mals. WINGLESS GREMLINS stand up to half a metre tall,
though they are often much shorter than this. They have thin
bodies supporting large heads, greenish skins, long noses
and pointed ears. They dress in ragged clothes of sackcloth
or animal hide, and carry short daggers. They are nasty little
creatures, who will not hesitate to attack beings much larger
than themselves. They are skilled at burrowing through the
earth, and may infest a dungeon complex with a myriad tiny
tunnels between the larger passages.
Their cousins, WINGED GREMLINS, are smaller and thin-
ner, but just as evil. They grow only to about fifteen centime-
tres tall, with tiny leathery wings sprouting from their backs,
but in all other respects they are similar to their larger,
wingless relations. They make ideal familiars for wizards,
and are often sent by them to gather ingredients or spy on
enemies. They are too small to use weapons effectively, but
they can bite with their sharp little teeth.
