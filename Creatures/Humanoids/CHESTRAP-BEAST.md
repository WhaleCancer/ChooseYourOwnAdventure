## Description

Many an unwary adventurer has met a grisly end while opening a treasure chest. Poison needles, gas jets and venomous serpents are just a few of the perils one may encounter; possibly the most alarming, though, is the **Chestrap Beast**.

**Chestrap Beasts** are found only inside a box or a chest, waiting malevolently for someone or something to come and open it! Related to [Gremlins](GREMLIN.md), they are small, mischievous humanoids, with very long arms that end in strong, claw-tipped hands. When the **Beast** hears a suitable victim approaching its hiding-place, it will crouch, ready to spring out and attack.

The moment the lid is lifted, it will leap up and slash out violently with its claws at the nearest living thing. It will hit on a roll of 1-4 on one die, causing 4 points of STAMINA damage. Once the **Chestrap Beast** has appeared, it may be attacked as normal. Inside their chests there may be all sorts of treasure, for the **Chestrap Beast** is a great hoarder of relics stolen from past victims.
