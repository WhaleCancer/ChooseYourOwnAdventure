## Description

The SERPENT QUEEN is a curious being, the subject of
much speculation by learned scholars. She arrived in Port
Blacksand many years ago, in the company of a merchant
who claimed to have found her wandering aimlessly while
he was crossing the fringes of the Desert of Skulls. She in turn
claimed to have originally been human, but to have been
transformed in a cruel ritual by the wicked sorcerer-priests
of the Caarth, in a city hidden deep in the desert. In an
attempt to resurrect the spirit of an ancient queen, the vile
beings had turned her head into that of a snake. Before they
completed the ritual, she managed to escape, only to wander
across the desert for many days, until she was found.

She now dwells in Port Blacksand, under the patronage of
Lord Azzur, who keeps her surrounded with such finery that
she is now known as the Serpent Queen. She is a sorry thing,
with a quick and violent temper. Anyone who deals with her
must guard his tongue, or she may attack him in rage. Her
neck will extend from its coils and she will try to sink her
poisoned fangs into his neck. Her powerful venom will cause
in the taverns whisper that she has killed many retainers,
and that Lord Azzur would pay well to have her trans-
formed back into a human once more – but no one has yet
dared to take up the challenge.
