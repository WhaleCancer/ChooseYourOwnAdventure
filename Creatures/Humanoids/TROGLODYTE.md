## Description

TROGLODYTES are a race of small, misshapen humanoids
that dwell far beneath the surface in caverns and chambers
hewn from the solid rock itself. They stand about a metre
high, with large ears and noses which help them move about
in the darkness of their subterranean domain. Despite the
darkness, they have become very skilled with their small
bows – hitting on a roll of 1-5 on one die, for 1 point of
damage. The little humanoids also use axes, daggers and
tools made from sharpened flint.
The creatures worship a vast and complex pantheon of Dei-
ties and Demons, and they have erected huge golden statues
in many places underground. It is not unusual for a larger
being, wandering the lightless depths, to stumble upon a
huge candle-lit cave, in which hundreds of tiny forms clad
only in loincloths dance excitedly around a glowing pile of
gold, chanting and wailing to their inhuman Gods. Troglo-
dytes fear surface-dwelling creatures like men, and will not
hesitate to attack them. When their prey has been overpow-
ered, though, they may decide to have some sport with him,
by putting him through the Run of the Arrow. One of the
Troglodytes will fire an arrow into the distance, and a cap-
tive will be allowed to walk out to the spot where it has
landed. Once there, they will start to shoot at him as he tries
to escape. Despite the dark, he will rarely escape the Troglo-
dytes' arrows.
