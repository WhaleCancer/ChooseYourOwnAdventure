## Description

It is not known whether the race of creatures called **MOLEKIN** were created during the God Time or were instead spawned by the mole-obsessed sorcerer Hurdagag Greenfinger. What is known is that they are a reclusive subterranean people resembling humanoid moles, with an animal-like snout, beady eyes, shovel-like claws on their hands and with bodies covered in short, dark fur. Molekin usually dwell alone, or in small family groups, in cave-like dwellings they tunnel into the sides of hills. These will be surprisingly well-appointed, with wooden furniture, shelves containing clay pots and bowls, a cooking alcove with a cauldron, and all lit by fireflies or glow-worms, trapped in a glass jar.

Molekin have also been known to use Armoured Moles as guard creatures, to protect their homes from tribes of more powerful marauders. Owing to their peaceable natures and mining skills, Molekin are usually on friendly terms with the local Dwarf settlements, and will often trade with them.
