## Description

According to tradition, at the heart of every good labyrinth
there is a MINOTAUR. This perilous beast is half-man,
half-bull – a fearsome combination. Its head is shaggy and
bovine, with a huge pair of horns curving from the top. Its
body is muscular and covered in short hair. Its overall colour
is sandy brown, though it will be filthy with dust and muck.
It can use weapons, if it has them, but its favourite method of
fighting is a head-down charge, snorting and stamping just
like a bull. Minotaurs may sometimes be placed to guard their
master's treasure-hoard, though they are more often the final
trap at the heart of a deadly maze.
