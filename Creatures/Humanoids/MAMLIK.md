## Description

**Mamliks** are powerful and dangerous humanoids known for their mastery of death magic. They are skilled warriors who combine martial prowess with deadly spellcasting abilities, making them formidable opponents. **Mamliks** are typically found in various locations across Titan, from towns and ruins to dungeons and wilderness areas, where they may serve as guards, assassins, or independent agents of chaos.

**Mamliks** are highly intelligent and cunning, using their magical abilities to devastating effect in combat. Their signature ability is the Death Spell, a powerful magical attack that can instantly slay their enemies. When not using magic, they are equally dangerous with swords and scimitars, making them versatile combatants. **Mamliks** are universally hostile to most other creatures and will attack without provocation, making them a serious threat to adventurers and travelers. They may be encountered alone as powerful individual threats, or in small groups when serving a greater evil master or protecting an important location.
