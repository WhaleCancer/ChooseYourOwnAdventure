## Description

Grumpy, crotchety beings, **Gnomes** shun the affairs of other creatures. They are small humanoids, related distantly to [Dwarves](../Dwarves/DWARF.md), and may be encountered in remote areas. They prefer to be left alone, free from the attentions of other races, who seem only to bring violence and other complications to their simple lives. They will prove most unfriendly if disturbed by a rude human, sometimes suddenly attacking with their small axes, sometimes using magic. **Gnomes** can perform all kinds of subtle magic, but will use it mostly to defend themselves, by turning invisible, making a sword go limp in its wielder's hands and so on. A **Gnome** will not normally use its magic to attack someone who unwittingly disturbs it, but if he continues to do so, he may find himself on the wrong end of a lightning bolt, or some other clear warning to leave the **Gnome** alone!
