## Description

The **Gorians** are a mysterious, inhuman race of creatures from the eastern plains of Allansia. They are nomads and are known to wander across the vast steppes that comprise the Flatlands, as well as the sweltering Plain of Bronze and the monster-haunted Plain of Bones.

In appearance, a Gorian is a tall humanoid with shaggy brown or black hair, a wide bestial face framed with flared bat-like ears, and green feline eyes. They have clawed hands, whose skin is grey in colour, and they prefer to attack with razor-sharp battle-axes and broadswords.

Gorians make for formidable warriors and skilled trackers, their nomadic lifestyle having honed their survival instincts and combat prowess. They are typically encountered in small groups, ranging from one to six individuals, and their reaction to outsiders can vary from neutral to unfriendly depending on the circumstances. Their average to high intelligence allows them to assess situations and choose their battles wisely, though they are not afraid to fight when their territory or interests are threatened.
