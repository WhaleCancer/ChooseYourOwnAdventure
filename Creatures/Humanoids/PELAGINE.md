## Description

The Pelagines are a race of Fish Men that dwell in the warm southern waters around the Isles of the Dawn and the Arrowhead Archipelago. Here they live beneath the waves, in underwater caverns alongside the oyster beds that they tend to. As well as food for the Pelagines, these oysters are also famous for producing a wide variety of pearls, some of which have special powers, including black, rose and silver pearls. They also produce scarlet pearls, which the Pelagines revere above all others as sacred, and they have even been known to send out raiding parties of one to six creatures to recover any of these pearls that are stolen from them (the punishment for theft of these pearls being death!).

The Pelagines worship a range of undersea deities, including Hydana and Ichthys, Lord of Fish, and are friendly with Sea Elves, with whom they trade their pearls. They hate Shark-Kin and Sea Trolls, and will attack them on sight.
