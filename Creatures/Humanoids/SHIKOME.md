## Description

**Shikome** are a warrior race of humanoids found in the remote mountains, ancient ruins, and deep dungeons of Titan. They are disciplined fighters, organized into small war bands or larger military units. Shikome are known for their martial prowess and their preference for well-fortified positions in defensible locations.

These warriors are typically clad in chainmail hauberks and carry small shields, making them well-protected in combat. They are skilled with a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, maces, and polearms, allowing them to adapt their tactics to different situations. Shikome are territorial and suspicious of outsiders, often viewing them as threats to their domains or potential looters of the ruins they guard.

Shikome war bands can range from small scouting parties of one to six individuals to larger raiding parties of three to eighteen warriors. They are not inherently evil, but their unfriendly to hostile nature makes them dangerous to encounter, especially if they believe their territory or treasures are being threatened.
