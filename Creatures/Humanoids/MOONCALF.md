## Description

In lonely places across the Old World, worse things than wolves are known to howl at the night sky, one such example being the hideous **Mooncalf**. Thought by some to be the cursed offspring of Lunara the Moon Goddess, and by others to be an experiment gone wrong by the Moon-Worshippers of Phlanx, there is no denying that the **Mooncalf** is a particularly grotesque creature. Its body is hairless, apart from a stringy black mane, and its pallid white flesh is marked by large blue-black blotches.

The **Mooncalf** walks on two legs, but drags its knuckles along the ground as it stumbles through the wilderness, moaning at the moon. In one hand it will usually have a crude flint axe or wooden club as a weapon. The head of the **Mooncalf** is equine in form, with dark eyes that seem to reflect the pale light of the moon. **Mooncalves** are solitary creatures, rarely encountered in groups, and they are known for their eerie howling and moaning that echoes through the night. They are hostile to all other creatures and will attack without provocation, driven by some unknown rage or curse that binds them to the lunar cycle.
