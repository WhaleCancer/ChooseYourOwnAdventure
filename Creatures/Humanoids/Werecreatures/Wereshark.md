## Description

The **Wereshark** is a rare type of Were-Creature, typically found in the warmer regions of Titan, such as azure tropical seas, their palm-fringed coastlines, and the dark and decadent city-ports of the south. Here they will have some scurvy means of employment such as being a pirate captain, or perhaps the chief of a band of smugglers.

At night however, they will transform into a terrifying hybrid of human and shark, with powerful jaws and a predatory nature. Weresharks are dangerous both on land and in the water, able to hunt in both environments. They are often found in port cities where they can blend in during the day and hunt in the waters at night. Their transformation gives them the strength and ferocity of a great shark while retaining their human intelligence and cunning.
