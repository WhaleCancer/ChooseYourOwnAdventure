## Description

More common in tropical parts than in the northern lands, **Weretigers** dwell alongside normal [Tigers](../../Animals/Cats/TIGER.md) in the bush. They will usually be in the company of at least one of them when encountered, no matter which form they are in. Unlike the other types, Weretigers are predominantly female, though they lose none of their ferocity for all that.

Weretigers are powerful and dangerous creatures, combining the strength and ferocity of a tiger with human intelligence. They are skilled hunters and fighters, able to use their three attacks effectively in combat. Their connection with normal tigers makes them particularly dangerous when encountered in their natural habitat, as they may have tiger allies nearby.
