## Description

This last type is the most common of all the Were-creatures, and **Werewolves** may be encountered in most places across the northern lands. The creatures have two bestial forms into which they can transform. They may turn themselves into Wolf Men, walking upright on their hind legs and using their front paws as hands. Or they may take the form of true [Wolves](../../Animals/Canines/), running on all fours to hunt with a pack of the creatures. When the full moon shines, a Werewolf will always be forced to assume this second form.

Werewolves are the most well-known of all Were-creatures, feared throughout the lands for their ferocity and the curse of lycanthropy they can spread. They are powerful combatants, able to use their claws and teeth effectively in both forms. Their connection with normal wolves makes them particularly dangerous when encountered in the wilderness, as they may have a pack of wolves nearby.
