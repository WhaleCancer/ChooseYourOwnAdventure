## Description

The **Werefox** is a clever, cunning creature that will live by its wits if possible, using bribery and deception to avoid combat at all costs. During the day they look like handsome or beautiful men and women with bright red or ginger hair, and at night they transform into large, crimson-furred foxes.

Unlike most other Were-Creatures, the Werefox is not motivated solely by hunger and bloodlust, and instead prefers stealing from, listening to the secrets of, and actively manipulating the normal people around it. To do this, they are able to cast one, some, or all of the following magical spells once per day: Befuddle, Peace, and Command. Most Werefoxes are similar in their animal shape to large foxes, but with an unnerving intelligence in their eyes that betrays their true nature.

Werefoxes are masters of manipulation and prefer to use their wits and magic rather than brute force. They are often found in towns and settlements where they can blend in and use their abilities to their advantage.
