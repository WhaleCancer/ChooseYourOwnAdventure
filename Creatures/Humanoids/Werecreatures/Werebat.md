## Description

In human form the **Werebat** is a gaunt-faced, feral-looking person, with lanky arms and sparse hair. At night however, while uttering a shrill, piercing cry, it will undergo a hideous and terrifying transformation. The creature's limbs will warp and distort, its arms contracting into its body even as the Werebat's fingers lengthen and membranes of leathery skin unfurl between them.

Once transformed, the Werebat becomes a creature of the night, able to fly through the darkness with its leathery wings. They are solitary creatures, preferring to hunt alone in the darkness. Werebats are drawn to dark places such as caves, ruins, and dungeons, where they can hide during the day and emerge at night to hunt. Their transformation is both a curse and a source of power, giving them abilities beyond normal humans but also isolating them from society.
