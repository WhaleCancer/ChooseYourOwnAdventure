## Description

Unrelated to [Rat Men](../../Animals/Rats/Rat-Man.md), despite many physical similarities, **Wererats** will often be found in small colonies among the maze-like tunnels of a city's sewers. Unlike other Were-creatures, they are sociable beings. The darkness of their subterranean home allows them to maintain their bestial form at all times, if they wish, which also helps them to negotiate the cramped tunnels of their home.

They have a keen sense of smell, and can track their prey through total darkness, even among the pungent smells of the sewers. Wererats are highly intelligent and organized, forming small communities in the underground. They are skilled at navigating the complex tunnel systems beneath cities and are often feared by those who know of their existence. Despite their rat-like appearance, they retain their human intelligence and cunning, making them dangerous opponents.
