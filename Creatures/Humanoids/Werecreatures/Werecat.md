## Description

**Werecats** are graceful and intelligent Were-creatures that can transform into large felines. In their human form, they are typically lithe and agile individuals with cat-like grace and reflexes. At night, they transform into powerful cats, retaining their high intelligence and cunning.

Unlike many other Were-creatures, Werecats are not always hostile. They are highly intelligent and may be encountered in both wilderness and urban settings. Their high intelligence allows them to blend into human society more easily than other Were-creatures, though they remain cautious and prefer to keep their true nature hidden. Werecats are known for their grace, agility, and independent nature.
