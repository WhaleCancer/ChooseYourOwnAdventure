## Description

The largest and strongest of all Were-creatures, **Werebears** prefer to live in the wilds with real [Bears](../../Animals/Bears/COMMON-BEAR.md) than in the company of men. A Werebear will usually be encountered with one to six ordinary Bears, which will obey his commands, whether he himself is in human or animal form. In their human forms Werebears will tend to be large, ponderous types who are slow to anger, but very dangerous when aroused.

Werebears are powerful creatures, combining human intelligence with bear strength and ferocity. They are solitary by nature, preferring the wilderness to civilization, and they have a deep connection with natural bears. When transformed, they become massive, powerful creatures capable of devastating attacks with their claws and teeth.
