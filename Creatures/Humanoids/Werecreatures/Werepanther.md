## Description

Long rumoured to exist among the leopard cults and tribes of [Panther Warriors](../Cats/Panther-Warrior.md) from the southern lands of Allansia, the **Werepanther** is a formidable creature. During the day they will be a tribal chieftain, a respected warrior or a white-haired priest, but at night they will transform into an enormous black panther with emerald-green eyes, hunting deer, antelope and enemies of their tribe.

Once a Werepanther has killed its prey with its razor-sharp claws it will drag them up a tree to a broad branch and feed at leisure. When the grey light of dawn filters down through the gigantic creeper-clad trees of the rainforest, the Werepanther will transform back into human form, often covered in the blood of their night's hunt. Werepanthers are among the most dangerous of all Were-creatures, combining high intelligence with deadly combat prowess and the stealth of a great cat.
