## Description

Many are the references in the legends of the subterranean
races to horrifically evil, horrendously foul-looking creatures
called BRAIN SLAYERS. They dwell in isolated colonies deep
in the earth, far below even the furthest explorations of the
inquisitive Dwarfs, and rarely venture towards the surface.
They detest light, warmth and indeed life itself; never was
there a race more suited to darkness.
Even the most insane Demon would have trouble imagining
a Brain Slayer. It is as though an octopus had somehow
sprouted from the shoulders of a large, strong human body.
Their skin is slick with slime and mucus, and is coloured a
stomach-churning purple-green. As they move, their tentacles
whip around in a frenzy, as if they were trying somehow to
sniff out living creatures to feed upon. They dress in long
flowing robes patterned with bizarre designs. To look into
the eyes of a Brain Slayer, it is said, is to gaze into pure,
unsullied hatred.
Their eyes carry their most potent weapon - a powerful
hypnotic gaze that can transfix a man and swiftly draw him
into the range of their tentacles. Anyone encountering a Brain
Slayer must successfully Test for Luck twice, or be
hypnotized. The creature will enfold the victim in its rank,
slimy tentacles and feed greedily upon his mental energy -
he will lose 1 SKILL point, and one die of STAMINA damage
from such a hit. After the first, incredibly agonizing strike,
the hypnosis will be broken, though, and the victim can attack
as normal against the flailing tentacles. If it finds itself losing,
a Brain Slayer will attempt to flee, for ultimately they are
cowardly creatures.
