## Description

The **Swamp Warriors** are an isolated tribe of humans living in a vast salt-swamp. They obtain hides and reeds from the swamp, make clothes and armour from these materials, and use coloured mud for body paint. They arm themselves with sharp-bladed spears.

The **Swamp Warriors** face many dangers in their swamp home, including the Mudgrinder and purple Crocosaurus. Their history traces back to the Allansian city-state of Kaad, from which their ancestors fled due to Chaos and dark creatures during the War of the Wizards nearly three centuries ago.

Their current village, Ekaad ('Kaad in exile'), is hidden in the Kok estuary and has a population of five hundred people. One hundred and fifty are **Swamp Warriors** with combat scores, while the rest have SKILL 6 STAMINA 6 and no armour, defending themselves with leather slings and daggers made from marsh monster teeth.

The village structure is a clearing in reed beds with no dry land, featuring houseboats, rafts, and huts with conical roofs. Nets are used to channel attackers.

Their religion involves worshipping Ashra and Vuh (Light and Life of the World) and being arch-enemies of Elim (the Dweller in Darkness), including Sargon the Dark. They speak their own language and thickly-accented Allansian. Key figures mentioned are High Priest Zune (guards the Staff of Ashra) and Chief Telad, with Elgon as their foremost warrior, known for dealing with Marsh Wraiths or Mist Vampires.

"Generations past, our people dwelt in a fair city on dry land to the east of the swamplands. In that time, a great darkness came upon the world. The Enemy who seeks to return all to Primal Chaos, raised up a legion of evil creatures and undead and led them against our land. Our city, although great to us, was small in the world and cut off from the capital of our King. The armies of the enemy swept down upon our city and we were forced to flee into the swamp. For thirty seasons we had no idea what had happened to the World Outside. We were afraid to send out scouts lest the Enemy had won and was even then searching for us. Then, at last, we got word that the forces of the Enemy were defeated, and we were glad. But we also learnt that new people were living in our city and we were sore afraid to return home, lest we should not be welcomed. Now many years have passed, and there is no one left alive who remembers how that city looked or where his family once lived. We are happy and healthy here in our watery domain, but we have kept our traditions and our faith, and we remain ever watchful for the return of the darkness."
