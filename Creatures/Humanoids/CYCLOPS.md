## Description

A head higher than a man, as strong as a Hill Giant but even
more aggressive, a CYCLOPS may be found at the heart of
many
battles.
These
savage
humanoids,
instantly
recognizable from their height, muscular build and the large,
single eye in the centre of their forehead, have long been

shunned by civilization because of their disturbing
appearance, and now begrudge the existence of all humans.
As a result, they will join the armies of human-hating Ores
or Lizard Men. Rising quickly up the ranks through their
prowess in battle, many become feared captains, who strike
such dread into their enemies that only the bravest of heroes
will face them in combat. Tales of their barbarism are
legendary, but most are unfortunately true: a Cyclops's
loathing for humankind knows no bounds.
When encountered away from the clamour of the battlefield,
a Cyclops will usually be living a solitary existence in an
isolated cave in hill country far from civilization, eating small
animals which it catches and kills in its brutally strong hands.
Made outcasts because of their cruel and violent natures, they
will instantly attack any human they encounter, afterwards
wreaking their final revenge by slowly cooking and eating
the bodies.
