## Description

Perched in towers hidden in the desert wastelands, the HA-
MAKEI are the last remnants of a past, more sorcerous age.
Centuries old, these brittle, withered humanoids have vul-
ture-like heads, and are usually swathed in masses of fine
robes. They are warlocks and sages, kept alive well beyond
their normal span by arcane spells and magical artefacts.
Their powers are wide, gleaned from decades of research in
forgotten libraries, but they use them only rarely. The Ha-
makei see themselves as scholars and observers, and will
rarely be drawn into the petty conflicts of mortal men. Their
lust is only for knowledge, and their advice can sometimes
be traded for an old scroll or ancient device.
As crotchety as an ancient owl, they can be extremely tem-
peramental and absent-minded, but will swiftly turn from
doddering fool to wily fox at the mention of lost knowledge.
Occasionally a Hamakei will set out into the world of men,
wandering from settlement to settlement in search of any
snippet it can overhear. Some are interested in the progress
of this younger age and will seek out human sorcerers, to see
how much of the lost arts they have rediscovered.
If encountered away from its home, a Hamakei will be
dressed in inconspicuous travelling-clothes, and will lean on
a long staff to help it along. The staff will usualy be magical
and may have spells bound into it. In the event of a direct
attack, a Hamakei can call upon many spells to ward off
attackers, including magical dusts that blind or charm an
opponent, and jets and walls of flame and ice. If such attacks
fail to repel an aggressor, it will be forced to use its staff to
defend itself as best it can.
Their towers will usually be defended by a host of magical
traps, to keep intruders away. Their treasure-hoard will be
large, consisting for the most part of hundreds of unintelligi-
ble and very, very ancient books, scrolls and papers, with a
few strange artefacts scattered among them. Any sage worth
his salt would pay dearly for even a glimpse of such trea-
sures, though they may appear all but worthless to an ad-
venturer.
