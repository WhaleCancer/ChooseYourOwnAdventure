## Description

HILL GIANTS are lumpy, ugly brutes that grow up to seven
metres tall. They are also fat, hairy and quite repulsive; they
are usually dressed in tatty furs and skins. Their favourite
weapons are huge wooden clubs, but they also enjoy throw-
ing large rocks down on smaller creatures or on villages.
Each rock will hit its target 3 times out of 6, causing 1 die of
STAMINA damage to its target. These beings make their
homes in large caves, which they sometimes share with
Bears and which the latter help to guard. For this the crea-
tures are rewarded with a regular supply of food. The favou-
rite provender of Hill Giants is human flesh, and their caves
may have a corner reserved for a 'larder', with many cured
joints hanging waiting to be eaten.
