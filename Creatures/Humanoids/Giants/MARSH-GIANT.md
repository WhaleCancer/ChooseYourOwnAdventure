## Description

Green-skinned and scaly, MARSH GIANTS are very differ-
ent to most other Giants. About six metres tall, they are thin,
with membranes between their arms and sides, and wide
webbed feet to help them swim. They dwell deep in swamps
and marshes, and spend most of their time submerged in the
slime hunting for food. They live mostly off small human-
oids like Marsh Hoppers and Kokomokoa, but they may also
attack humans who venture into their domain. They will
overturn rafts and hold their victims underwater until they
drown, before dragging them out again and eating them.
