## Description

FROST GIANTS, which can grow up to six metres tall, live
only in the coldest regions, such as the ice plains north of the
craggy Icefinger Mountains.

Their skin is pale white, but much of it is usually hidden by
their long white beards and hair, and under swathes of Polar
Bear fur. They are solitary beings, preferring the company of
Snow Wolves to that of other Frost Giants. If encountered out
hunting, a Frost Giant will be accompanied by 1-6 Snow
Wolves. They live on the meat of any creature they can catch.
They will stay clear of Toa-Suo, however, for they fear that
they will be overwhelmed by sheer force of numbers. Frost
Giants are not afraid of attacking humans, for they know that
the little beings may also be carrying Gold, which Frost
Giants dearly love to hoard in their caves.
