## Description

The largest of all Giants dwell not on the land, but underwater

SEA GIANTS are enormous blue-skinned beings that can
reach ten metres tall. Their feet and hands are webbed, and
their hair flows in tresses over their scaly bodies. They are
said by superstitious sailors to be responsible for storms and
whirlpools at sea. Certainly they dislike the intrusion of large
vessels into their domains, and may make their presence
known. Common tactics include sending great waves to
swamp boats, or rearing out of the water to overturn them.
Sea Giants can breathe both air and water, but never venture
on land. When swimming in the open ocean they may be
accompanied by Dolphins or Merfolk, with whom they are
friendly. They make their lairs in great caves on the sea-bed,
which they decorate with treasure taken from sunken ships,
by plastering the walls with coins and littering the floor with
jewels.
