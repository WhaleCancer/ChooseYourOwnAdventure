## Description

MOUNTAIN GIANTS are only found among the highest
peaks of large ranges. They can reach as much as eight
metres in height; their bodies are hefty and muscular. They
are usually clad in thick furs and hides, and will be carrying
large stone clubs or axes. Mountain Giants are very strong
and can uproot trees and huge boulders to throw at their
opponents. These have a 3 in 6 chance of hitting, for one die
plus one point of damage.
A Mountain Giant may keep a Giant Eagle as a pet or for
hunting, training it to attack intruders into his or her domain.
They are solitary beings and are very avaricious, hoarding
gold and other treasure in their caverns high in the clouds.
When encountered away from their lairs, they will usually
be carrying a large sack holding a few Gold Pieces, several
throwing-rocks and a few scraps of food (a couple of boars,
half a cow, or some other light snack).
