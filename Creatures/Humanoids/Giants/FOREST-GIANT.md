## Description

Fully grown FOREST GIANTS can be as much as five metres
tall. They are muscular beings, typically dressed in rough
brown or green clothes of fur and cloth, with ruddy-brown
skin and unkempt hair. They will be carrying a huge club
made from the large branch of a tree, or a stone-headed axe,
and sometimes a sack containing a few Gold Pieces, some
food, and maybe even a few choice rocks for throwing.
Unlike many Giants, this race cares for its habitat, and tends
the trees of the forest. They are sometimes friendly with Tree
Men and Wood Elves, though they often come into conflict
with the former. While Forest Giants may tend young trees
and bushes, they have no qualms about chopping down
larger ones for firewood! Like the other races, though, they
don't take kindly to trespassers in their domains and will
attempt to remove them. They will throw rocks from a dis-
tance (hitting on a roll of 1-4 on one die, for 3 points of
damage), before closing to finish them off with their clubs.
They are not averse to eating humans, though they find them
a little stringy and unsatisfying; they prefer deer or boar.
