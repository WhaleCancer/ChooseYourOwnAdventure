## Description

In vast stone castles perched above the clouds, on top of the
jagged peaks of high mountains, solitary STORM GIANTS
look down on the world of Giants and men alike with dis-
dain. They are great scholars, their hawks gathering news
from the farthest lands for them. Unlike other Giants, they
are very intelligent, and have been the keepers of the wis-
dom of ancient times for many centuries. In their secluded
castles are stored books, scrolls, devices and machines from
past ages, most of which are unintelligible to a modern
sorcerer or sage.
A Storm Giant is typically eight metres tall, thin but muscu-
lar, with pale skin and yellow hair. They dress in fine robes
and may be carrying a huge staff. From their lofty peaks they
sometimes dabble in the affairs of others by changing the
weather. They can send rain, heatwaves and even violent
electrical storms down from their castles to influence the
actions of armies or fleets. More often, however, they will use
their powers to help the land itself in times of flood or
drought.
Their castles may be shared with Giant Eagles or Air Elemen-
tals, with whom they are friendly. They will be spartan,
devoid of decoration and with plain furniture and fittings.
Their libraries and observatories are more opulent, and
crammed with relics.
