## Description

CAVE GIANTS are the smallest of all Giants, growing to
little more than three metres tall – and appearing to be even
shorter, because their backs are hunched over from life in
their low-ceilinged tunnels. They only dwell underground,
living on other denizens of the darkness. Their skins are light
grey in colour and hairless, enabling them to blend with their
surroundings and surprise their prey (for one automatic
blow) 5 times in 6. Their silvery eyes have grown dim from
peering in the subterranean gloom, and they will be blinded
by the sudden appearance of bright light. A Cave Giant will
be wearing a loincloth and carrying a stone club or a sack of
throwing-rocks. They are unintelligent beings, and will at-
tack almost everything. They especially love the tender flesh
of Troglodytes, which they scoop up to chew on when they
are hungry.
