## Description

**Fen Folk** are a reclusive race of humanoids that dwell in the marshes and wetlands of Titan. They are a peaceful people who prefer to avoid conflict when possible, though they will defend their homes and families if threatened. **Fen Folk** are skilled at navigating the treacherous marshlands they call home, and they have developed a deep understanding of the plants and creatures that inhabit these environments.

**Fen Folk** are typically of average human height, with webbed hands and feet that aid them in swimming through the murky waters of their marshland homes. Their skin has a slightly greenish tint, and they often wear simple clothing made from marsh plants and animal hides. They are known for their knowledge of herbalism and their ability to craft useful items from the materials found in their environment. While generally neutral towards outsiders, **Fen Folk** are wary of those who would harm their marshland homes and will band together to drive out those who threaten their way of life.
