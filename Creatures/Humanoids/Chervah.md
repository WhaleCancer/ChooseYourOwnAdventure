## Description

The **Chervah** of the southern lands are a mysterious race of creatures thought to be related to Halflings. They are slim, about a metre and a half tall, with skin that is dark and almost black in colour. Their head is large and rounded, and, comically, almost too large for their spindly body, with wide-set eyes, small noses, pointed Elf-like ears and completely hairless. The voice of a Chervah is high-pitched, with a curious musical ring to it. They dress according to circumstance, but always colourfully, and although they prefer to avoid conflict and combat where possible, will arm themselves with weapons such as daggers and crossbows for protection.

The city of Rimon is the legendary 'Home of the Chervah.' Chervah are found in towns throughout the southern lands, where they often work as scribes, court officials, or lawyers, taking a keen interest in personal enrichment. They are skilled herbalists and apothecaries, and are known for their excellent vegetarian cooking. Chervah have a tendency for long, rambling conversations, and they hold a curious belief that misfortune is caused by invisible 'demons' such as sleep demons and memory demons.

The Chervah are a proud race, often ridiculed for these beliefs, their appearance, and their long, difficult-to-pronounce names. They often use "Chervah" as a travel name when journeying outside their homeland. A famous Chervah, Sroonagh Monnow Pirrashatha, served Chadda Darkmane and was slain by Jamut Mantrapper.
