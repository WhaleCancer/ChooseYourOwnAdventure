## Description

Possibly related to Lizard Men, with which they share many
physical similarities, CALACORMS are strange reptilian
humanoids often found in the service of an evil leader. They
are about two metres tall, covered completely in grey scales,
and have very long tails, which drag along behind them.
Bizarrely, the creatures also have two heads, which chatter to
each other the whole time. They are strong but simple
creatures, who are content and reliable as long as their needs
are catered for. If they have a plentiful supply of their
favourite food (dead snakes!), a comfortable room, and the
occasional prisoner to torture when they want entertainment,
they will follow their master to Hell if need be.
They can speak the language of men, though with both heads
talking at once it is often difficult to understand what they
say. If they are in the employ of someone, they will be
carrying a sword or spear, with which they will fight skilfully.
Their strength, and the coordination the two heads give them,
make them redoubtable fighters. However, they are terrified
of rodents - especially mice! When faced with one, a Calacorm
will shriek with terror and hide in a corner until the little beast
has gone. Why they do this is not clear, though an old legend
talks of how a Lizard God, called Suthis Cha, choked to death
while trying to devour the Mouse God Karreep. It is possible
that the suspicious Calacorms fear that mice come seeking
revenge for such a blasphemy against their Deity!
