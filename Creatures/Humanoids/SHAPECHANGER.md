## Description

There are some predators that use stripes or spots to hide in
cover until they can leap on their prey. But the
SHAPECHANGER has the best camouflage of all, for it can
transform itself into other creatures. In the guise of a weak,
defenceless being, it will approach its human victim before
striking!
Its powers are thought to be part illusion and part physical
transformation. It can change the general shape, size and
features of its body, and fills in the finer details with a
magical illusion rather like hypnotism. It mostly takes the
form of a small, weak creature such as a Goblin, a Pixie, or
even an ageing human – anything that will enable it to get
close to its prey. Once it is in range, the Shapechanger's
appetite will ruin its concentration, and it will begin to
change back into its natural form.
Its features become reptilian, all green and scaly, and spines
burst through the clothes down the length of its back to
where a long tail now swishes in expectation of the meal to
come. Its limbs thicken and it grows taller and broader, its
sinewy body surmounted by a lizard-like head, a long forked
tongue flicking languidly between alarmingly large teeth. It
will attack by slashing with its clawed hands.
Once it has eaten its fill of its prey, the Shape-changer may
steal fine items of clothing to replace those ruined by its
transformation, before moving on in search of more food.
