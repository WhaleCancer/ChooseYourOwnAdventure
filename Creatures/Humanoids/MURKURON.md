## Description

Contrary to what many heroic sagas would have people believe, human adventurers are actually fairly scarce in number, as the majority of the populace tends to prefer less lethal occupations. For one race however, known as the **Murkurons**, adventuring appears to be their only occupation! These are strange, thin-bodied humanoids, with silvery skin and pupil-less eyes that range in hue from white through grey to black. With their pointed ears and slim build, they have some similarities to both [Elves](../Elves/) and smaller creatures such as Mites and [Fairies](../Fairies/Fairy.md), though their exact origins are unknown. **Murkurons** are common in the lands surrounding the Glimmering Sea in southern Allansia, and there are notable communities of them living in city-states such as Kallamehr and Alkemis.

Typically however, **Murkurons** will be encountered in an adventuring party, with two to seven members for less dangerous localities, and up to two to twelve adventurers for more lethal regions. The majority of each party will be warriors, clad in chainmail with a sword as a weapon. At least one **Murkuron**, and sometimes two, will be a wizard, wearing voluminous robes and armed with a staff or dagger. These wizards are quite powerful, and prefer using spells such as Fire-Bolt and ESP when out exploring the wilds or some dank dungeon. **Murkurons** do have their own language – indeed some can barely speak proper Allansian, but beyond this, little is known at this stage of their culture or religion.
