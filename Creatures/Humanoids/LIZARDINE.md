## Description

No one is really sure where LIZARDINES come from. Differ-
ent scholars talk of a hidden kingdom beyond the eastern
jungles, of an isle in the southern seas, or of a mysterious
land across the western oceans. The scaly humanoids will
appear as if out of nowhere, stay for a few years, and then
move on as if they had never been there at all. They look a
little like Dragons, but with a human's proportions rather
than a lizard's – longer arms, straighter legs and no wings.
They are covered in scaly skin, usually a deep red colour,
though in keeping with human conventions they will wear a
few clothes or wrap themselves in a cloak.
If encountered in a town, a Lizardine may well be discreetly
running a shop, selling strange magical trinkets from far-
away lands. The most common of these are scorpion-shaped
brooches of different metals which will bring luck, strength
or protection to their wearer, but they may also sell other
items too. Such treasures occasionally attract foolish thieves,
who are unaware that the Lizardine has its own defences. In
an attack the beast can breathe fire from its mouth, which
will hit its target on a roll of 1-3 on one die, causing 1 point
of STAMINA damage in addition to any normal fighting
damage caused by its claws. Such abilities have sometimes
caused frightened townspeople, fearing the beasts, to drive
them out of their settlements. Because of this, the Lizardines
are discreet and secretive, keeping to themselves as much as
possible, and basing their businesses in the merchants' quar-
ter of a town or port, where they are lost among the many
other bizarre and foreign inhabitants.
