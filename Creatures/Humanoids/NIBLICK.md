## Description

One of the more unpleasant races to be found in Allansia are the thieving **Niblicks**, murderous footpads who love nothing better than to trap unwary travellers, beat them to a pulp and rob them. They are short humanoids, at just a metre tall, but with large heads and mean-looking faces. Armed with clubs and wearing hooded robes and cloaks, **Niblicks** will lie waiting in ambush for a hapless victim.

Erupting from their hiding place, they will shout instructions at each other in high-pitched twittering voices, and commence whacking their victim with their clubs until they are subdued or dead. **Niblicks** are cowardly creatures who prefer to attack from ambush and overwhelm their targets with numbers rather than face them in fair combat. Despite their small size and relatively weak combat abilities, their cunning and willingness to use dirty tactics make them a dangerous threat to unwary travelers.
