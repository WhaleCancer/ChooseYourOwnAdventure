## Description

**Panther Warriors** are a fierce and agile humanoid race native to the dense jungles of Titan. They possess a lithe, cat-like grace and are known for their exceptional stealth and hunting prowess. Their culture is deeply connected to the jungle, and they wear pantherskin armor that provides both protection and camouflage in their natural environment.

Panther Warriors are highly intelligent and organized, often operating in small hunting parties or larger war bands. They are territorial and protective of their jungle domains, viewing outsiders with suspicion and hostility. Their combat style emphasizes speed, agility, and precision strikes with their daggers, making them dangerous opponents despite their relatively modest physical statistics.

These warriors are skilled trackers and hunters, able to move silently through the jungle undergrowth. They have an intimate knowledge of their environment and use it to their advantage in both hunting and warfare. Panther Warriors are not inherently evil, but their unfriendly nature and territorial instincts make them difficult to approach or negotiate with.
