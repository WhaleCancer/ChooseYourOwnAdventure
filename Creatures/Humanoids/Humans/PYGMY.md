## Description

In some parts of the world primitive tribes of semi-humans
still live, cut off from civilization. In remote jungle areas,
stunted savages known as PYGMIES dwell. A little over a
metre tall, they wear only loincloths, and their skins have
been turned dark brown by the sun. They live on fruit and
roots, as well as monkeys and other small creatures, which
they hunt with blowpipes and poisoned darts. The venom is
not strong enough to kill a human, but it will knock someone
unconscious if it hits him (3 in 6 chance). Each dart will also
cause 1 point Of STAMINA damage.
Pygmies love gold and jewellery, and will steal it from their
unconscious victims before melting back into the jungle. They
live in well-hidden villages deep in the undergrowth, ruled
over by a tribal chief and his witch-doctor. In the village there
will also be between three and eighteen females and between
two and twelve children, none of whom are able to fight.
