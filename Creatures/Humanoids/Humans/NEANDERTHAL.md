## Description

The brutish semi-humans known as NEANDERTHALS are
a primitive and violent race to be found in many areas. They
will usually be encountered as a hunting-party or in a
settlement – typically a crude circle of huts around a religious
totem or statue. They look like thin, filthy humans, with wild

hair and untrimmed claw-like nails on their hands and toes.
They will be carrying crude spears and knives, and may be
decorated with poorly made pendants, bracelets, and studs
in their ears and noses.
They are unintelligent beings and will sometimes be found
in the service of a cleverer leader – an Orc, Goblin, or maybe
even an evil human. Neanderthals have a whole pantheon of
primitive Gods, for they worship everything they don't
understand from the sun to a mountain. One member of a
tribe may be a shaman, dressed up with bones, feathers and
rattles and covered in bizarrely painted designs. They have
no special powers except a great sense of theatre and ritual.
Anyone demonstrating real magic to a Neanderthal tribe can
expect to be treated as nothing less than a God!
