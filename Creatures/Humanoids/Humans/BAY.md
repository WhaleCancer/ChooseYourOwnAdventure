## Description

BAY
When barbarian tribes swept down from the Icefinger
Mountains and settled across the teeming plains of north-
western Allansia, they discovered a small, brown-skinned
race of Goblin-like creatures dwelling in crude villages
along the shores of the Western Ocean. Named BAYS,
after their preferred choice of habitat, these creatures had
a peculiar religious festival that involved clubbing a
statuette (usually of a god like Hashak or Hydana) far out
to sea. Over time, the barbarian kingdoms turned into
city-states and the Bays settled within them, while their
idol-hitting ritual evolved into the game we now know
today as Bays’ Ball.
Bays’ Ball is played by two teams of six players each. The
players comprise a flinger, a catcher, and four fetchers
(first sack, second sack, third sack and outfield). Each team
can have two substitutes and one ring-in (such as a
nameless adventurer), per game. Each game has six
innings, and in each innings both teams get a chance to
strike the leather ball flung by the flinger of the other team.
Each striker has one strike only, and three outs (including
being caught) means the end of a team’s innings. The away
team strikes first.
The game is played in cities and towns across north-
western Allansia, wherever there is a community of Bays.
Port Blacksand and Salamonis in particular are noted for
the skill of their Bays’ Ball teams, such as the Gallows
Street Ghouls (from Blacksand) and the Valley Road
Vagabonds (from Salamonis). Bays’ Ball has also spawned
an imitation game played by humans and larger races like
Ogres and Trolls, called Ogreball. Purists deride this
variant however, as the teams are smaller, with the catcher
replaced by a tree stump or fence post that the flinger is
attempting to hit with the ball.
