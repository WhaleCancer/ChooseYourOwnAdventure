## Description

Related to Neanderthals, CAVEMEN are primitive semi-
humans who live in rocky regions. Their caves are often
joined together by passages to create whole villages cut into
the rocky hillsides. They dress in the furs of animals, typically
bearskins. Cavemen will usually be carrying stone clubs or
flint-headed spears (these can be thrown, hitting on a roll of
1-3 on one die for 3 STAMINA points of damage).
Cavemen are very unintelligent, and communicate only in
animal-like grunts. They will attack all other large beings,
either for food or because they seem like a threat to them.
Cavemen are surly, aggressive beings, and they tend to fight
among themselves. There is almost always a war going on
between two or more tribes, usually over some very trivial
matter.
The caves of these beings are nauseously filthy, scattered with
rotting food, old furs and discarded straw bedding. They will
usually contain nothing of any worth to an adventurer.
