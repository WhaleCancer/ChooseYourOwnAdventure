## Description

On distant islands in the near-uncharted reaches of

the

great

Black

Ocean

dwell

the

mysterious

MONKEY MEN. These are a poorly understood

race of creatures who look exactly like monkeys but

are the same size as men. Monkey Men dwell in

small villages of huts made from giant banana

leaves, on palm-fringed archipelagos such as the

Coral Islands and the Shark Islands. Here they hunt

in the jungles surrounding their village for small

game and useful plants, including edible Nauk

Fruit and the healing fronds of the Tiger Palm. One

to three hunters will usually be encountered, armed

with bamboo clubs and a supply of throwing rocks.
