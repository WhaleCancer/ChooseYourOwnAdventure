## Description

Life in the thick forests of Allansia and beyond is not
restricted to ground level. High in the trees live many agile
creatures which moved upward originally to escape
predators. In time, however, the predators followed them,
and the tree-tops are as dangerous as the ground. From huts
built on platforms perched in the crooks of large branches,
brutish APE MEN, the largest predators in the trees, swing
far and wide on vines rigged up like ropes, on the trail of food.
They are huge hair-covered humanoids, related to
Neanderthals and Cavemen and usually dressed in little more
than an animal-hide loincloth; they carry a large bone club.
They are omnivorous, eating the meat of small forest creatures
as well as fruit and berries, depending on what they can find
as they travel about their leafy domain. Ape Men are very
agile and can swing on the thinnest of branches or hang by
one hand. Anyone who tries to fight them while perched up
a tree, however, must reduce his Attack Strength by 2 points
to account for the precarious surroundings. In an Ape Man's
lair, typically a tree-house woven from branches and carpeted
with grass, there will be many bones and rotting fruit. There
may also be a few cheap, brightly sparkling trinkets, for like
most primitives Ape Men are attracted to objects that twinkle
in the light.
