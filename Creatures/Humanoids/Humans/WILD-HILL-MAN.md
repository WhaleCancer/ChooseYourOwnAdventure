## Description

The WILD HILL MEN of the Moonstone Hills in eastern
Allansia are a race of primitive humans related to Cavemen
and Neanderthals, though they are more intelligent than
either. They dress in animal furs and tanned hides, and
usually carry stone clubs or axes and crude bows. The bows
will hit on a roll of 1-3 on one die, for 3 points of damage to
their target's STAMINA. Hill Men will usually be encoun-
tered on the trail of some prey. They are skilled at tracking
down animals, which they then roast on spits above an open
fire. They live on boar, deer, wild ducks, rabbits and other
creatures. Gathered together in small tribes, they typically
dwell in crude grass huts or caves. They don't have chieftains
or any form of organized society; they just gather together
for mutual protection from the ravages of larger creatures
and other more warlike tribes.
