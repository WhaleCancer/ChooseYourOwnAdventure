## Description

Not to be confused with the goat-headed Chaos Beast Men described later on in this very tome, the BEASTMEN of Kakhabad are an obscure race of subhuman chaotics. Thought to be related to the Klattamen of the lowlands, the Beastmen dwell in the deep valleys between the Zanzunu Peaks, their tiny villages clustering around waterways such as the Tinpang, Ilklala and Vischlami Rivers. They are brutish, brawny, shaggy-haired creatures, with narrow eyes, broad noses, high sloping foreheads and black hair growing over their dark-skinned bodies.

Their villages are concerned with mining, and when encountered in their villages there will be 3-18 of them, led by a champion with SKILL 8 STAMINA 8. When encountered as guards or mercenaries, they are found in groups of 1-6. They forge their own weapons, and typically wear chainmail hauberks, horned or spiked helmets, and carry cruel-bladed scimitars, long barbed spears, and battle-axes. The Archmage of Mampang has been known to recruit them, and there are rumours of cults kidnapping young Beastmen to train them as "Chaos Warriors!"
