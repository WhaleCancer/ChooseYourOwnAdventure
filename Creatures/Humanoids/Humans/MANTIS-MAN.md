## Description

The so-called MANTIS MEN of the northern Bak-lands have,
in their isolation, developed an alarming method of ensnar-
ing their food. When first encountered, a Mantis Man will
invariably be standing totally motionless, more like a life-
sized statue than a real being. Its long arms and hands will
be raised to its chest, clasped together as if the 'statue' were
praying devoutly! A wary creature may spot a blink of an
eye, or a tremble of the hands, before the Mantis Man's arms
shoot forward to grab its prey. A Mantis Man can be fought
normally, but if at any time it delivers a successful strike on
its opponent, it will lift and kill him instantly with a bite from

bite from its wide, fang-filled mouth. A victim's only hope,
therefore, is to try to damage its arms and render it unable to
attack.
In the wild, Mantis Men live alone or in small groups. When
out hunting, though, they will always be on their own – even
the stupidest creatures may get suspicious of a whole tribe of
motionless statues! Mantis Men are attracted to bright and
shiny things, and will often hoard any such items found on
their victims.
