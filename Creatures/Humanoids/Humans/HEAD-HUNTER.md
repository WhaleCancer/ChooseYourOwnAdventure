## Description

In the depths of the jungle live small tribes of brutish primi-
tives. They are known as HEADHUNTERS because of their
grisly habit of boiling and curing the heads of their victims
until they have shrunk down to a quarter of their normal
size. These are then worn as decoration, tied to their loin-
cloths to indicate their prowess as warriors. They are canni-
bals, preying on other tribes, especially the weaker Pygmies,
whenever they need food.
They dress only in loincloths and war-paint, with feathers
tied in their hair. Their favourite weapons are clubs and
spears, which they tip with carved flint. Head-hunters dwell
in small villages, in which three to eighteen (three dice) of
them will be encountered. Each tribe is ruled over by a
powerful medicine man, a direct link between the supersti-
tious primitives and their many vengeful Gods. The shaman
will be wearing a ceremonial mask and many pieces of crude
jewellery to indicate his status among the rest of the tribe.
