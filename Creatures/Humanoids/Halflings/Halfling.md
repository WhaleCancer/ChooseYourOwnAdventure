## Description

**Halflings** are a peaceful, contented race of small humanoids, typically standing about a metre tall. They are known for their love of comfort, good food, and simple pleasures. **Halflings** prefer to live in quiet, rural communities away from the troubles of the wider world, though some may be found in towns and cities working as merchants, innkeepers, or in other trades that allow them to maintain their comfortable lifestyle.

Despite their small size, **Halflings** are surprisingly resilient and can be quite brave when their homes or loved ones are threatened. They are skilled with slings and short blades, and many are excellent cooks and farmers. Their communities are typically well-organized and self-sufficient, with a strong sense of community and mutual support.
