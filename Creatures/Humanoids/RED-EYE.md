## Description

RED-EYES are thin, spindly humanoids distantly related to
Elves and humans; they live in small numbers in many border
towns and villages across the semi-civilized world. They are
arrogant beings, who delight in harassing and playing tricks
on their neighbours as excuses for starting a fight. Anyone
caught up in such antisocial behaviour must be on his guard,
for Red-Eyes have a deadly natural weapon.
Most of the time a Red-Eye will walk about with its eyelids
closed tight to seal in its powerful vision. Their eyes can shoot
out deadly bolts of energy when opened, so they have to keep
them hidden, for fear of incinerating everything they gaze
upon. The strength of their eyes is such that they can make
out vague outlines through their closed eyelids. As a result,
Red-Eyes are not very accurate in combat. Any time a
Red-Eye receives a wound, however, it will let fly with its
heat vision. The first shot will be very inaccurate, and can be
avoided by rolling 1-5 on one die. Should the Red-Eye be
injured again, it will let loose another blast, avoidable by
rolling 1-4 on one die, and so on until the blast hits
automatically. Each time it hits, the blast burns for one die of
STAMINA damage; if a Red-Eye's vision hits the same person
twice, he will die.
Because of this power, Red-Eyes are greatly feared and are
invariably forced to travel from settlement to settlement,
without being allowed to stay in one place more than a single
night. As a result their clothes are nothing more than rags and
their possessions are meagre – but their hatred for humans
grows ever stronger.
