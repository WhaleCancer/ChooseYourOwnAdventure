# Behemoth

**Type:** Chaos beast / Primeval monster  
**Origin:** Biblical / Primeval chaos  
**Era:** Ancient, potentially active in 1985

## Overview

**Behemoth** (/bɪˈhiːməθ, ˈbiːə-/; Hebrew: בְּהֵמוֹת, bəhēmōṯ) is a beast from the biblical Book of Job, and is a form of the primeval chaos-monster created by God at the beginning of creation. It is paired with the other chaos-monster, [[Creatures/Chaos-Beasts/Leviathan|Leviathan]], and according to later Jewish tradition both would become food for the righteous at the end-time.

Metaphorically, the name has come to be used for any extremely large or powerful entity.

## Nature

Behemoth represents the primeval chaos of the land, a massive terrestrial monster of immense power and destructive capability. In biblical tradition, it is one of the great chaos beasts created at the beginning of creation, representing the untamed forces of nature and the wilderness.
