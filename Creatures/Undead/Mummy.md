## Description

In musty crypts and tombs some corpses grimly hang on to a semblance of life, almost as if they were afraid to let go and die. In countries where the dead are embalmed and wrapped tightly in bandages to be preserved these undead beings appear as **Mummies**. They can move only slowly, as they are wrapped in constricting bandages, but they can unerringly find living creatures, detecting their life-forces like a beacon in the darkness.

They attack by flailing about with their fists. Fighting a **Mummy** is not as straightforward as it seems, for they cannot be truly killed by blows from weapons. Although they will appear to die, they will return to life after twenty minutes and follow their would-be killers, to extract revenge. The only sure way of finishing off a **Mummy** is to set it on fire. Even a single touch with a blazing torch is sufficient for its bone-dry wrappings to catch fire and completely immolate the **Mummy** in a few seconds, leaving nothing but a pile of ashes.
