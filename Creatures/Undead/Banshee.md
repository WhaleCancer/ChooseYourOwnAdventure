## Description

**Banshees** are hideous undead creatures often heard, but rarely met, in the desolate, forsaken wastelands in which they dwell. They are chiefly known for the soul-shredding wail that they constantly howl, both day and night, as they wander the wastes. The ghastly spectres are thought to be human spirits, trapped on this plane and unable to rest, as punishment for some horrific crime committed when they were alive.

In its new form, a **Banshee** appears as a shrivelled, knotted old man or woman, with long, unkempt hair, one large nostril and a single tooth. Its eyes are ringed red; all the creature's sorrow and anger is reflected in them, if anyone dares to look. In an attack, it will use its scaly, claw-tipped hands. Its screaming will prove very disturbing to its opponents, who must roll their SKILL or below on two dice at the beginning of each Attack Round, or be transfixed with fear until the next round. If opponents become petrified with fear in this way, they will be very easy targets for the **Banshee**'s claw, which will automatically cause 2 points of STAMINA damage for each strike.
