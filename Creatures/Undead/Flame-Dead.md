## Description

The ancient races of Dragons have accumulated much arcane knowledge over the millennia, a great deal of it totally incomprehensible to sorcerers of other races. The creation of **Flame Dead** is one such field of knowledge. They are the reanimated skeletons of creatures slain by dragon flame, and so are most often found in the company of Gold, Red and Green Dragons.

Flame Dead are a disquieting sight even to the most experienced adventurer. Their skeletal bodies burn with a green, supernatural fire, while white flames dance wildly in the creature's empty eye sockets. In combat the Flame Dead attack with their hands, which burn an opponent for one die of STAMINA damage with every hit; armour provides no protection.

Dragons use the Flame Dead for a number of purposes, putting them to work as servants, and as guards for their treasure hoards. Sometimes a Dragon will use Flame Dead to convey a message to people it is trying to impress or frighten. The power of speech, and the high level of intelligence of the Flame Dead used up a great deal of magical energy, which accounts for their low STAMINA score. However, like Skeletons, Flame Dead suffer only 1 point of STAMINA damage per blow from edged weapons; smashing and crushing weapons do normal damage.
