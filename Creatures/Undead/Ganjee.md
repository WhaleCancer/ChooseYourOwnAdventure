## Description

Between the Earthly Plane and the Magical Planes is a nebulous layer known as the Spirit Plane. Its inhabitants dwell half in the world and half out of it.

Most are souls passing up or down to the domains of their respective Deities. Some beings dwell permanently on the Spirit Plane itself: [Poltergeists](./Poltergeist.md) are trapped here because of the nature of their deaths. But the **Ganjees** live here on purpose.

Related to Ghosts but far more hateful, these non-corporeal entities are little more than a small concentration of energy, driven by spite and anger, but they can appear to their victims as ghostly white faces, contorted with devilish glee. Anyone who meets one for the first time must immediately lose 1 SKILL and 2 STAMINA points from sheer terror!

**Ganjees** can extinguish flames, throw objects and even wield weapons. Fighting back against them, though, is very difficult, because they do not have physical bodies. However, they can sometimes be bribed to let someone pass freely, by the gift of a magical item such as a potion or sword – though they are just as likely to forget all about their bargain and use these very items against the adventurer!
