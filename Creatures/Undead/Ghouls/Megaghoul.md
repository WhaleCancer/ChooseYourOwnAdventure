## Description

Thought by some to represent the pinnacle of necromantic research into the Ghoul form, the **Megaghoul** is a dire beast indeed. They are exceedingly rare and spawned only by the most depraved of death magi; for example, one was the final guardian of that near-immortal Vampire Lord, Count Reiner Heydrich himself.

The Megaghoul is an imposing creature, a monstrous green-skinned Ghoul-like thing, wearing an iron mask, which hides all of its face save its bloodshot eyes and slavering fangs. Immense clawed steel gauntlets are strapped to its fists, dripping vile poison and hissing acid, and it is with these fearsome weapons that the creature will strike out at its foes.

Anyone hit by a Megaghoul in combat must roll on the following table to determine the amount and type of damage they suffer:

- **Roll 1:** Lose 2 STAMINA points
- **Roll 2-4:** Lose 2 STAMINA points +1 extra STAMINA point for acid damage
- **Roll 5-6:** Lose 2 STAMINA points +1 extra STAMINA point for acid damage and +1 extra STAMINA point for poison damage

The Megaghoul is immune to all kinds of acid, which are utterly useless in combat against it. However, a powerful blast of magical fire (such as Dragon's breath or a HOT Spell, but not a Fire Bolt Spell) will destroy it in two Attack Rounds. However, it will continue fighting, causing double damage with a mixture of acid, fire, and superheated metal.

The Megaghoul's poisoned steel claws also cause paralysis. Four hits in combat will immobilize a victim, who then watches in terror as the Megaghoul devours them.
