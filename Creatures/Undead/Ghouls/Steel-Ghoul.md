## Description

The **Steel Ghoul** is a bizarre undead construct, created by a demented sorcerer in the Ghoulcrypts of the Old World. In appearance it resembles a normal Ghoul, if there is such a thing, though somewhat larger, clad in gleaming metal yet with a body of rotten flesh. Bands of iron are sunk into its arms and legs, providing armour of sorts, while from its hands protrude knife-long metal blades. It looks as if an insane creator had fused metal into the body of a Ghoul to strengthen it, making it a formidably powerful opponent.

These augmentations have come at a cost however, as while the Steel Ghoul's metal claws can still rend and dismember its victims, their touch cannot paralyse, as the touch of a normal Ghoul often does. Nevertheless, they are strong fighters and difficult to defeat.
