## Description

Once, perhaps, they were human, but not now. **Ghouls** are noxious undead creatures whose spirits hover halfway between life and death. They dwell in tombs and crypts, for they eat corpses - especially those of humans. They look very much as though they are dead themselves, with rotting, maggot-ridden skin only half hiding their decaying innards. Their tongues loll from sickly, grinning mouths as they hiss with delight at the prospect of fresh meat.

They will attack with their clawed hands, slashing violently about them, apparently unafraid of the swords held against them. The hands of a **Ghoul** carry further dangers, for they have the power to paralyse their prey, leaving him immobile and ready to be devoured. If a **Ghoul** manages to hit someone four times, he will be unable to move or speak, or indeed do anything else at all. His whole body will go numb, his breathing will become more and more constricted, and he can only wait to be eaten.
