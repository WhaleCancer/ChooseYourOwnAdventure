**Greater Paralysis:** If a Greater Ghoul manages to hit someone three times, the victim will be unable to move or speak, or indeed do anything else at all. Their whole body will go numb, their breathing will become more and more constricted, and they can only wait to be eaten.

## Description

There are Ghouls, and then there are **Greater Ghouls**, more powerful examples of this foul undead race, made stronger by lingering evil, more malice, or the malignant tampering of twisted necromancers. Also known as Huge Ghouls, these are monstrously large, grey-skinned creatures with a rotting stench, blackened stump-like teeth and drooling spittle. They hunger for living flesh, and are found in isolated underground chambers, gnawing on bones and gristle. When disturbed, they attack with filth-encrusted, bloody talons and fiery-eyed hatred. Their size and strength allow them to paralyze opponents in three successful hits (compared to four for normal Ghouls), after which the victim is eaten alive.
