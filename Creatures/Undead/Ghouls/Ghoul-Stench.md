## Offense

**Greater Paralysis:** If a Stench Ghoul manages to hit someone three times, the victim will be unable to move or speak, or indeed do anything else at all. Their whole body will go numb, their breathing will become more and more constricted, and they can only wait to be eaten.

## Defense

- **Stench:** The disgusting odour that surrounds a Stench Ghoul nauseates and weakens its victims, deducting 2 from their Attack Strength in melee combat.

## Description

Smelled and heard long before being seen, the arrival in the vicinity by a dreaded **Stench Ghoul** will be presaged by snarling grunts and slobbering (no doubt while it is chewing on the bone of a previous unfortunate), and a putrescent repulsive stench that of course gives the creature its name.

A Stench Ghoul is a normal Ghoul tainted by an undead disease, resulting in a half-rotting green thing that was once human. The disgusting odour that surrounds it nauseates and weakens its victims, deducting 2 from their Attack Strength in melee combat. The disease makes it more powerful, requiring only three successful hits to paralyze an opponent, compared to four for normal Ghouls. Victims are then eaten while still alive.
