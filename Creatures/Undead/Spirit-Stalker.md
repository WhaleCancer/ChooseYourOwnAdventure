## Description

Animating a corpse so that it becomes a mindless [Zombie](./Zombie.md) requires a fair amount of magical knowledge and research, but it can be done by any sorcerer worth his staff. Creating the diabolical undead beings known as **Spirit Stalkers**, however, requires remarkable power. The last known sorcerer to possess such power was the Night Prince, Zanbar Bone – but then he was already half undead himself.

**Spirit Stalkers** appear as extremely pallid, ghoulish humans, with decaying skin stretched so tightly across their bones that it has torn in many places. They will usually wear cloaks and cowls to hide their horrifying features. Unlike a Zombie, they have retained their intelligence, and will prove to be skilful opponents. The touch of a **Spirit Stalker** burns living flesh, for 2 points of damage to a person's STAMINA. Their deathly origins mean that they cannot be harmed by normal weapons, which will puncture and cut them but will not harm them physically. Only a weapon made from solid silver can harm a **Spirit Stalker**, burning its dead flesh just as its touch burns living flesh. When they finally die, their robes fall to the floor, as their bodies dissolve in a hiss of thin smoke to be blown away on the wind.
