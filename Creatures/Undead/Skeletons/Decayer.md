## Description

**Decayers** are strange, mouldering skeletons, often created as guards by evil necromancers. They appear just like animated human skeletons, wrapped up in rotting clothes. Their bones are a sickly yellow, as are their vacant eyes. The air around a **Decayer** hangs heavy with disease and decay. Anyone coming within three metres of such a creature must successfully Test for Luck or come down with a heavy fever a week or so later, which gradually turns into the rotting disease described below.

In an attack, a **Decayer** will use its claws, while at the same time releasing a cloud of near-invisible disease-ridden spores. Anyone actually fighting the foul being at this time will automatically be infected with a cruel rotting disease that does not manifest itself for a week or so. Until that time, the victim will be completely unaware that he has been infected. After a week, he will suddenly be struck down with a strong fever that will confine him to his bed and gradually worsen until he is very near to death. His body will be racked with great pain as mould spores begin to burst through the skin, making him lose 2 STAMINA points an hour until he dies.

During this time, the swift ministrations of an experienced healer may be able to kill the mould and halt the spread of the disease. Certain very rare herbs are needed to effect such a cure, however, and victims often die while waiting for them to be found. Should someone die from the rotting disease, they will rise as a new **Decayer** in twenty-four hours' time unless the body is burnt and the ashes scattered. The new **Decayer** will follow the orders of the creature which first infected it, and perhaps join it on its eternal guard-duty.

## Creating Decayers

Decayers are created using the [Raise Undead](../../../../RULES/Magic/Necromancy/Rank%206/Raise%20Undead.md) spell. This spell requires 8 magic points to create a Decayer. The spell takes a whole hour to cast and requires a corpse. The caster must be close to the Decayer to issue it with orders, which will be followed literally until countermanded.

Decayers can also be created when someone dies from the rotting disease caused by a Decayer's attack. Unless the body is burnt and the ashes scattered, the victim will rise as a new Decayer within twenty-four hours.
