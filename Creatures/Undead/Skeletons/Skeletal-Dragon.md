## Description

Similar to the dreaded Kragon, which is discussed elsewhere in this august tome, the **Skeletal Dragon** is an undead member of the draconic races, imbued with an evil half-life following its untimely death under the blade of a dragon-slayer or adventurer. Unlike the Kragon however, they are much further along in their state of decomposition, and are comprised almost entirely of yellow, mouldering bones. The Skeletal Dragon cannot fly, nor does it have a breath weapon, but it makes up for this with powerful snaggle-toothed jaws and mighty talons, backed by a deep hatred against all living things that mock its loathsome undead form by their very existence.

When encountered there is a 1 in 3 chance that the creature has not fully assembled from the pile of bones that marks its resting place. In this case, the adventurers will have two free Attack Rounds before the Skeletal Dragon can respond, as it struggles to pull itself together.

The intelligence of Skeletal Dragons varies, often derived from their past lives, ranging from feral to cunning, with some even capable of speech and magic. One such example is Ktuliaxus the Cruel, whose lair is in the rocky wilderness that marks the western boundary of the Desert of Skulls. This particularly malevolent Skeletal Dragon preys on travellers between Oyster Bay and Sapphire City, attacking them for their treasure.
