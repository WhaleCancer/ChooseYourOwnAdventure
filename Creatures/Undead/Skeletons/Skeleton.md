## Description

**Skeletons** are the favourite servants of many evil sorcerers. They are fairly easy to animate, like Zombies, but unlike the latter they do not fall apart after a few months. They are not intelligent, but they will be bound obediently to their master, who can give them short commands up to about twenty-five words long. If their master dies, the **Skeletons** he animated will instantly fall apart.

They are fairly skilled at fighting, not least because their jerky, almost insect-like movements distract their opponents. They will typically be armed with swords or axes. Since they are nothing more than bones held together with a little magic, swords and daggers have great trouble harming them. Anyone using an edged weapon will cause only 1 point of damage to a **Skeleton**. Smashing and crushing weapons will do normal damage.

## Creating Skeletons

Skeletons are created using the [Raise Undead](../../../../RULES/Magic/Necromancy/Rank%206/Raise%20Undead.md) spell. This spell requires 6 magic points to create a standard Skeleton, or 7 magic points to create a [Skeleton Warrior](Skeleton-Warrior.md). The spell takes a whole hour to cast and requires a corpse. The caster must be close to the skeleton to issue it with orders, which will be followed literally until countermanded.
