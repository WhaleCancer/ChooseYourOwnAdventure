## Description

The ancient lords of northern Allansia had a tradition of being buried in stone tombs with their battle-armour and favourite weapon, not realising that many centuries later they would be reanimated as **Skeleton Kings**! Stronger than either Skeletons or Skeleton Warriors, they prowl the corridors of their mausoleums attacking all intruders.

Skeleton Kings typically wear a tattered chainmail hauberk and carry a sword and shield, or a two-handed greatsword. Some wear plate armour. They are interred in burial chambers with Skeleton Warriors as guards, and sometimes with a trusted steed that may resurrect as an undead skeletal horse.

Like all Skeletons, sharp weapons will only do 1 point of STAMINA damage to them per successful hit, whereas blunt or crushing weapons will do normal damage.
