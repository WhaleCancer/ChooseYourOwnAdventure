## Offense

| Roll | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7+ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strangulation** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |

**Strangulation:** Every Attack Round, the victim automatically loses 2 STAMINA points with no Armour Roll allowed. Attack Strengths are still worked out as normal; if the victim has the higher Attack Strength, they damage the Skeletal Strangler, but if they have a lower Attack Strength, their blow is ineffective.

## Defense

- **Resistance to Edged/Piercing Weapons:** Takes only 1 point of damage from edged weapons (swords, daggers), piercing weapons (arrows, crossbow bolts), and similar attacks; blunt weapons cause normal damage; magic weapons cause normal damage even if they are of the resisted type.

## Description

The **Skeletal Strangler** is a minion of doom, used by evil necromancers as an assassin and a guard. As its name suggests, it resembles a Skeleton, but usually wears a black hooded cloak, with glowing red eye-sockets that grow brighter and brighter as it engages with the enemy! Skeletal Stranglers attack with amazing speed and unerring accuracy, gripping the throat of their victim before they even have time to react. Every Attack Round it will strangle its victim and they must lose 2 STAMINA points automatically, with no Armour Roll allowed. Attack Strengths are still worked out as normal however, and if the victim has the higher Attack Strength they have managed to damage the Skeletal Strangler, but if they have a lower Attack Strength then their blow is ineffective. The Skeletal Strangler must obviously be destroyed before it throttles the life from its opponent!

Like all Skeletons, sharp weapons will only do 1 point of STAMINA damage to them per successful hit, whereas blunt or crushing weapons will do normal damage. They also have one final proverbial trick up their black-cloaked sleeve: their glowing eyes are caused by red gems set in the sockets, and when the Skeletal Strangler is slain, these gems will rise from the collapsing bones and whirr angrily in mid-air. Whoever slew the creature has time to perform one swift action, such as quaff a potion, before these gems fly straight at them, trying to burrow their superheated substance into the victim's flesh. The victim must Test their Skill twice, and each time they fail, one of the gems strike them and cause 4 STAMINA points damage from the burning that is inflicted. The gems then become inert, and are worth 2-12 Gold Pieces each. Skeletal Stranglers were known to be used by the second incarnation of the Vampire Lord, Count Reiner Heydrich, to guard one of his hidden lairs in Analand.
