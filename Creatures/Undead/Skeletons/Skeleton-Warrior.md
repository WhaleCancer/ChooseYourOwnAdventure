## Description

Some necromancers have managed to instil a greater fighting skill into their **Skeletons**, to create **Skeleton Warriors**. These will usually be clad in strong armour and carrying a broadsword or battle-axe. Again they need short commands, but since they are unable to do anything but fight, the orders can be more specific. They are usually left on guard-duty over particular areas, patrolling unceasingly until they encounter an intruder.

**Skeleton Warriors** are like normal Skeletons in that sharp weapons only do 1 point of damage to them; blunt weapons do normal damage.

## Creating Skeleton Warriors

Skeleton Warriors are created using the [Raise Undead](../../../../RULES/Magic/Necromancy/Rank%206/Raise%20Undead.md) spell. This spell requires 7 magic points to create a Skeleton Warrior (compared to 6 magic points for a standard [Skeleton](Skeleton.md)). The spell takes a whole hour to cast and requires a corpse. The caster must be close to the Skeleton Warrior to issue it with orders, which will be followed literally until countermanded.
