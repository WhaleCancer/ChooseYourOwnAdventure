## Description

**Common Ghosts** are spirits of the dead; non-corporeal entities trapped between the Spirit Plane and our own world, until some deed or action is completed that will allowed them to be released from their torment. They usually appear as glowing apparitions of how they were in life, or at the moment of their own death, translucent figures in ancient garb, radiating a chilling aura and wailing at their tragic plight. Unlike Spectres and Wraiths, many Ghosts have no hatred for the living, and will gladly exchange scraps of lore or omens of fortune for a means of liberation from their existence. Indeed, some Ghosts, such as Siegfried Heydrich of Mortvania, or Sargon the Dark from the sewers beneath Blacksand, actively seek out adventurers to complete tasks and quests for them. Woe betide those who refuse however, as the curse of a Ghost is a terrible thing: anyone cursed by a Ghost immediately loses 2 LUCK points and 1 point of SKILL.

Other Ghosts have begun to succumb to the evils of undeath, and will attack immediately. They can only be harmed by silver or enchanted weapons and magic spells, and are also affected by the Ward or Banish powers of a priest; attempting to fight a Ghost without such things will almost certainly result in death. Ghosts do not cause physical wounds but rather drain the strength of their opponents. The table below depicts the amount of damage caused by a Ghost depending on how many times it hits its opponent.

Anyone hit more than ten times by a Ghost is automatically slain. STAMINA and LUCK points can be restored through normal means, but SKILL points will return at the rate of 1 point per 30 minutes if resting completely, or 1 point per hour if not resting. Ghosts can be injured by Holy Water, which cause 1-6 STAMINA points damage if successfully thrown. Some Ghosts cannot cross running water, except via a bridge, and all Ghosts are repelled by a Spirit Door. This is a door made from blackwood and engraved in silver with sorcerous sigils that prevents the entry of any non-corporeal undead. Ghosts can also be captured by a Spirit Snare, which is a modified bear-trap on a chain and made from silver; those that are caught can then be transferred to a silver flask for safe-keeping.

Some Ghosts, particularly those with strong ties to a given area, may be quietened with an appeal to one's ancestors, if they hail from the same place. A Ghost that is made placid in such a fashion will revert to a more helpful entity as described above. Others tell of the Trial of Ghosts, an arbitrary adjudication where the spirits of the living are caught in the Dream World, and are judged on matters of luck by three old ghostly crones in a manner reminiscent of a witchcraft trial. The lore of Titan is rich with the manifestations of Ghosts, particularly the celebration known as the Night of the Ancestors, and the evening before it, which is called the Spirit-Watching. Famous ghosts of Titan include the riddling spirits of Djarat that still stalk the ruins of the Desert of Skulls, the evil warrior-ghosts of demons from Hachiman that are known as Shura, Captain Velyarde of the cursed ghost-ship Sea Maiden that sails the twelve seas for all eternity, Lord "Filthy" Lucre the Headless Highwayman of Lupravia, and the aptly-named Baron Blood, Lord of the Wild Hunt, who leads a marauding band of ghostly minions across the northern reaches of the Old World on long moonless nights...
