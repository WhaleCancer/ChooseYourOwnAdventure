## Description

Also known as Snow Ghosts, the merciless fiends called **Ice Ghosts** are thankfully confined to the wintery northern wilderness. Some rogue individuals are found further south, such as those imprisoned within the Howling Tunnels of the Allansian Flatlands, and whose eerie moaning cries give the tunnels their name. Indeed, the presence of attacking Ice Ghosts is always preceded by a gust of cold, howling wind, followed by the appearance of the creatures themselves: glowing white beings flying through the air, with agonized looks upon their faces, and diffuse bodies trailing behind them. Letting out a soul-chilling scream, they will attack!

Opponents armed with enchanted weapons and magic spells will be able to attack the Ice Ghosts normally in combat; those unfortunates who do not must make three successful Test for Skill rolls to avoid being hit before the creatures fly off. Anyone hit once by an Ice Ghost will begin shiver uncontrollably, turn deathly white and lapse into unconsciousness. If they are immediately Healed by a Priest, or the cold is drawn from their body by placing certain magical stones upon their forehead, they will survive with the loss of 2 STAMINA points. Otherwise, they will die of hypothermia; likewise, a second touch by an Ice Ghost is instantly fatal! The body of anyone slain by an Ice Ghost will then vaporise, becoming an Ice Ghost themself and attacking anyone in the immediate vicinity, starting with their former comrades!
