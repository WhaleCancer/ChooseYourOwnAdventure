## Overview

**Ghosts** are spirits of the dead; non-corporeal entities trapped between the Spirit Plane and our own world, until some deed or action is completed that will allowed them to be released from their torment. They usually appear as glowing apparitions of how they were in life, or at the moment of their own death, translucent figures in ancient garb, radiating a chilling aura and wailing at their tragic plight.

Unlike Spectres and Wraiths, many Ghosts have no hatred for the living, and will gladly exchange scraps of lore or omens of fortune for a means of liberation from their existence. However, some Ghosts have begun to succumb to the evils of undeath, and will attack immediately.

## Special Abilities

### Ghostly Touch (Common Ghost)

Ghosts drain strength rather than cause physical wounds. The damage depends on the number of hits:

| Number of Hits | SKILL lost | STAMINA lost | LUCK lost |
|----------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 3-4 | 2 | 4 | 2 |
| 5-6 | 4 | 8 | 3 |
| 7-8 | 7 | 14 | 4 |
| 9-10 | 11 | 22 | 5 |

Anyone hit more than ten times by a Ghost is automatically slain.

### Ice Touch (Ice Ghost)

Anyone hit once by an Ice Ghost will begin shiver uncontrollably, turn deathly white and lapse into unconsciousness. If immediately Healed by a Priest, or the cold is drawn from their body by placing certain magical stones upon their forehead, they will survive with the loss of 2 STAMINA points. Otherwise, they will die of hypothermia. A second touch by an Ice Ghost is instantly fatal! The body of anyone slain by an Ice Ghost will then vaporise, becoming an Ice Ghost themself.

### Sulphur Touch (Sulphur Ghost)

The sulphurous touch automatically causes 2 STAMINA points of damage per Attack Round with armour providing no protection. Some adventurers claim that nose plugs provide the only defence against such an attack, but this has yet to be successfully verified.
