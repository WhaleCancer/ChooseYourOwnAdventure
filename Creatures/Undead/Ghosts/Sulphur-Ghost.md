## Description

Rarer still are the strange nebulous beings known as **Sulphur Ghosts**. Resembling little more than a discoloured and vaguely humanoid-like puff of smoke, they haunt volcanic wastelands and rock-strewn wildernesses, and are reputed to be the spirits of unfortunate wanderers who have died in such desolate places. Sulphur Ghosts will skip about in the air like a demented puppet, all but transfixing their enemies, before shooting down to envelop their foes in a suffocating embrace of poisonous fumes. The sulphurous touch of such a creature automatically causes 2 STAMINA points of damage per Attack Round with armour providing no protection. Some adventurers claim that nose plugs provide the only defence against such an attack, but this has yet to be successfully verified. Like all Ghosts, Sulphur Ghosts can only be harmed by magical weapons and spells, and are also affected by the Ward or Banish powers of a priest. Perhaps the most famous of all Sulphur Ghosts is kept in a wooden box atop the North Gate of the cityport of Kharé, attacking anyone who fails to recite the correct Spell of Opening…
