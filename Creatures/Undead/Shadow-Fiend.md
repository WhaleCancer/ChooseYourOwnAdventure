## Description

Here comes an adventurer, creeping warily down a

dungeon passage, his way lit only by the flickering

flame of his lantern. The shadows dance as he

treads carefully on; in every corner, it seems,

strange beasts are hiding, waiting to strike. He

gives a start, perhaps, as his own shadow rears up

on the wall next to him, before relaxing again,

chiding himself for being so nervous. Then the

SHADOW FIEND strikes!
