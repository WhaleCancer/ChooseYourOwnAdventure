## Description

Known to some as the Princes of Darkness, **Vampires** are the most feared of all undead beings. Their evil powers and near-immortality make them very difficult to kill, and many heroic adventurers have come to grief while trying to do just that. A **Vampire** will usually be encountered in or near its crypt, to which it must return to hide from the sun's fatal light every dawn. When it wishes to feed, a **Vampire** may turn itself into a bat and fly out into the night to seek a victim.

It feeds on the warm blood of humans, which it will try to suck straight from their jugulars by biting their necks with its elongated teeth. To help it get close enough to do this, a **Vampire** has a powerful hypnotic gaze. Anyone caught by the red-eyed stare of a **Vampire** must successfully Test for Luck, or fall under its power, lose his own will and stand limply while the thing sucks out his blood. If a victim is bitten three times on consecutive nights, he will die and return as a **Vampire** himself, ready to seek out and feed off his fellow adventurers.

There are a number of ways that a **Vampire** can be killed. Exposing it to direct sunlight will kill the thing instantly, causing it to shrivel to dust in its cloak. A **Vampire** will rarely be caught in such a manner, however, since it flees to the sanctuary of its coffin at the first sign of dawn. A crucifix or clove of garlic brandished at the creature will keep it away for a few minutes only.

Attacking a **Vampire** with a normal weapon is not wise. A **Vampire** can be hit, and blows will appear to injure it. They won't in fact do any damage to the thing, however, and once the weapon is pulled out, the wounds will close again. A silver weapon can harm them. When a **Vampire** is killed in this way, its body will crumble to dust, but from it a bat will emerge and fly away. The bat is the **Vampire**'s spirit, which will return to its normal form after a couple of days, and come back to extract its revenge.

The best way of killing a **Vampire** once and for all is to drive a stake through its heart while it sleeps during the day. To do this, of course, its coffin must be found, typically hidden in an ancient crypt beneath a graveyard. Once the stake has been driven into its heart, the **Vampire** will awake and then die painfully. The terrible being will remain dead until the stake is removed again, when it will return to life, unless it is beheaded and everything is burned.
