## Description

**Vampyres** are undead thralls that serve the will of their master, which is usually the powerful Vampire that initially enslaved them by biting them two times on consecutive nights (if bitten a third time by their liege they will become a fully-fledged Vampire).

As such they appear as pale but attractive young men and women, clad in baroque black clothes with long, red-painted fingernails and ruby-red lips that part to show sharp canine teeth. If the Vampyre has fed recently, then fresh red blood will be dripping from their mouths! While they may recoil from the sight of a crucifix or a clove of garlic, and are destroyed by direct sunlight, they lack many of the other powers of their Vampire masters (see Out of the Pit, p. 116). They cannot hypnotize victims, and are vulnerable to normal weapons, silver, or enchanted blades.

If a Vampyre's Attack Strength is 21 or more when it bites an opponent, it will have bitten deep into the victim's throat, causing them to lose 1 STAMINA point per Attack Round until the combat ends or the bleeding is staunched. If a victim is bitten in this way a second time, they will die and rise as a new Vampyre servant of the Vampyre's master.

Vampyres are common in Mauristatia, where they form covens. The Vampire Lord, Count Reiner Heydrich of Mortvania, is known to have many Vampyre servants.
