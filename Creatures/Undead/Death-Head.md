## Description

The **Death Head** is a powerful type of Undead, used by necromancers as an assassin against particularly troublesome foes. The usual method is to bind the creature's spirit to an item; a Ring of Undead Calling perhaps, or an ivory skull ornament. When the item is worn or touched, there will be a sudden blinding flash, out of which appears a dark figure wearing a long, hooded cloak. This is the Death Head and it will walk slowly towards its victim brandishing two shimmering, white-hot daggers. Its face is drawn and lifeless, with decaying skin and maggots writhing in its eye sockets. Once it has killed its target, the Death Head will fade away, leaving only its daggers behind. However, anyone who picks up these daggers will suffer a terrible curse, losing points from their LUCK score.
