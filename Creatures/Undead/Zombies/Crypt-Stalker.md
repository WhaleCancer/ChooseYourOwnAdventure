## Description

There is a custom in many lands decreeing that upon the death of a nobleman or high priest, his riches are entombed with him, so his power and wealth may follow him to the afterlife. However, there is also a custom in many lands that, from the moment the tomb is sealed, all the local thieves and adventurers will form a queue to break in and steal the treasure! Hence, many tombs have been given their own unsleeping guardians, undead beings ready to surprise any potential burglar.

The **Crypt Stalker** is one such deathly guard, often animated from a favoured servant of the tomb's inhabitant, and sacrificed to serve his master in death as in life. It resembles a Zombie, with lifeless, rotting skin and long, dank hair; tatters of decaying raiment may still cling to its putrid flesh. Being undead, they can only be damaged by enchanted or blessed weapons; others will appear to damage them, but will not in fact do any harm.

Holy water, blessed by a high priest, will act like a strong acid if thrown over them, doing one die of STAMINA damage. In an attack against intruders, a **Crypt Stalker** will strike with its bare hands and grip with unearthly strength. If it scores two successful hits in a row, it will grasp its opponent's neck and strangle him for an additional die of damage. Each Attack Round after this, the victim must strike successfully and free himself of the grip, or take the same extra damage, until one or the other is killed. **Crypt Stalkers** do not keep any treasure of their own, but will be guarding a very rich hoard.

## Creating Crypt Stalkers

Crypt Stalkers are created using the [Raise Undead](../../../RULES/Magic/Necromancy/Rank%206/Raise%20Undead.md) spell. This spell requires 7 magic points to create a Crypt Stalker. The spell takes a whole hour to cast and requires a corpse. The caster must be close to the Crypt Stalker to issue it with orders, which will be followed literally until countermanded.
