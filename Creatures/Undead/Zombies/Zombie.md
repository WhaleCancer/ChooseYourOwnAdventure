## Description

With vacant, hollow eyes staring blankly from their sickly white faces, deathly **Zombies** shuffle around musty crypts and dungeons in the service of their necromantic masters. Unlike most undead beings, they cannot stay alive after their deaths through the strength of their life-force. Instead, their bodies are animated by a master sorcerer after a long and complicated ritual. This makes them slow and stupid, as though a part of their spirit was lost when their bodies returned to life. They cannot think for themselves, and must be commanded by their creator, if he wants them to do something besides just standing and rotting in a corner.

**Zombies** look very unhealthy, their pallid skin scarred and peeling, and their clothes hanging in rags, but they are strong in a fight, slashing or strangling with their clawed hands. They are slow and clumsy, though, as their every action is in response to another's command. If their master is killed, they will wander aimlessly, or continue with the last task they were commanded to do.

All **Zombies** can be severely injured by the careful application of holy water which has been blessed by a priest, a phial of which will cause one die of STAMINA damage, as it eats like acid into the evil things. **Zombies** may often be found keeping guard over hoards of treasure or important areas of a castle, for they are too slow to serve as personal servants to their evil masters.

## Creating Zombies

Zombies are created using the [Raise Undead](../../../RULES/Magic/Necromancy/Rank%206/Raise%20Undead.md) spell. This spell requires 7 magic points to create a Zombie. The spell takes a whole hour to cast and requires a corpse. The caster must be close to the Zombie to issue it with orders, which will be followed literally until countermanded.

Unlike Skeletons, Zombies do fall apart after a few months, making them less permanent servants.
