## Description

The **Kragon** is surely one of the rarest and most feared undead beasts ever to stalk the surface of Titan. Seldom has a man witnessed such a fiend and lived to tell the tale, but a few years back the sage Canastus had the misfortune to see a fight between five men and a Kragon in the wilds of the Flatlands of Allansia. This is how he put it in his Journals:

"And then I espied the five warriors, creeping gingerly into the cavern's mouth. But before they had disappeared into the shadows there came an ear-splintering shriek and out of the cave came the most hideous creature I have ever seen. All five brave warriors attacked at once, but the thing was too fast, too strong, and too evil. It tore them apart in seconds, and then it saw me. I ran, and I have never run so fast in all my life. I do not know how I escaped, but I did, and I will never forget the sight of that terrible thing."

Kragons are pure evil, savage, undead dragons. Their SKILL and STAMINA scores are reduced compared to living dragons, but they are still formidable opponents. They lack breath weapons and do not hoard treasure like their living counterparts. They can fly on tattered rotting wings around the Palace of Agony, and are created through a magical ritual that binds the spirit of a slain dragon to its decaying body.
