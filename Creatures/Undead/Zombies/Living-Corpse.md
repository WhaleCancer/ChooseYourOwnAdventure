## Description

In the violent lands of Kakhabad and Allansia it is not uncommon to stumble across the scene of a battle, with fresh corpses left sprawled on the ground where they died. But when some of the bodies begin to rise to their feet, a clever man will realize that no ordinary battle took place there, as the **Living Corpses** ready themselves to attack their next victim!

Similar in appearance, if not in manner, to [Zombies](./Zombie.md), these ghastly beings look like half-decayed bodies, the flesh falling away in places to reveal internal organs and bare bones. Their rotten state makes them seem fairly fragile, but they can move surprisingly fast for a dead body! They will leap on their alarmed opponent and try to strangle him with their bony, flesh-peeling fingers.

Should their opponent manage to land a hit on a **Living Corpse**, the creature will split up into six separate parts, and each will attack its victim, biting, clawing, crushing, kicking and hitting without respite. The parts are as follows:

| Dice roll | Part | SKILL | STAMINA |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Head | 4 | 1 |
| 2 | Right arm | 5 | 2 |
| 3 | Left arm | 5 | 2 |
| 4 | Torso | 6 | 3 |
| 5 | Right leg | 4 | 2 |
| 6 | Left leg | 4 | 2 |

Each part will attack separately with its own Attack Strength. Each roll should be checked against the opponent's single Attack Strength. For each one that is higher, a hit will be delivered to the victim. For his part, he can attempt to hit only one of the parts (chosen at random by rolling one die on the table above). If his attack is better than the part's, he will put it out of action and it will not attack him again. However, the body part will stay in the fight, and he may accidentally hit it again, wasting a blow. If a single **Living Corpse** is facing more than one opponent, it will divide its parts between them. Should every part finally be defeated, they will flap ineffectually until they reunite into their true form again - a battered (and now really dead) corpse.
