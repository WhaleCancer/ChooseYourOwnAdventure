## Description

When a truly evil man dies, his body will pass away and crumble into dust in his crypt, but his evil will remain to haunt the area, manifesting itself as a ghostly white spirit that will prey on the living. A **Death Wraith** will only ever be found close to the coffin containing its physical remains, for the link between the two stays strong. It will be wrapped in its funeral shroud and will appear roughly humanoid in shape, with a deathly red-eyed skull and a pair of skeletal hands poking out of the ancient cloth.

Beneath the robe, however, there is nothing, for a Death Wraith is little more than a vaporous spirit, combined with a few earthly remains. As a result, blows from normal weapons will alarmingly pass straight through it! But a weapon made of silver will hit it normally, for the metal exists both on the Earthly and the Spirit Planes. In return, the ghostly Death Wraith will attack with a very real sword, often part of the large hoard of treasure buried with its physical form when it died many centuries before.

*Note: Changes have been made to the original statistics (SKILL 9, STAMINA 10, Life Drain ability, and removal of dagger weapon option) to properly position the Death Wraith as a stronger Wraith with access to the iconic ability of Wraiths. Small Claw has been added as a weapon option in case the Death Wraith is disarmed.*
