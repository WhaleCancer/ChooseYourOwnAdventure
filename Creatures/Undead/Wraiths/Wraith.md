## Description

A **Wraith** is a tortured, tormented undead spirit, appearing as a smoky, wailing apparitional figure radiating chilly malice. It floats towards enemies with wispy claws to drain life-force. It causes STAMINA loss, and a roll of 1-4 after being hit results in a permanent loss of 1 SKILL point. Victims can restore vitality with amulets or potions.

Wraiths can only be harmed by magic or silver weapons, as normal weapons pass through them. Their habitats include places of forgotten evil, abandoned graveyards, battle sites, and ruined crypts. Northern Ruddlestone has a Wraith Wood, and rumours tell of a town in the Deathmoor infested by Wraiths, warning adventurers to avoid such places.
