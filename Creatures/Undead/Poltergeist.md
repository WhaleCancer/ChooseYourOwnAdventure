## Description

Ancient folk-tales sometimes claim that victims of a
particularly violent murder will remain at the place of their
death, unable to depart from the Earthly Plane until their
killers themselves die. Such spirits may manifest as
**Poltergeists**. They are spiteful and malevolent, and will
try to harm anyone entering their domain. They are invisible
and immaterial, and cannot physically attack their opponent.
Instead they will throw chairs, plates, rocks and other small
objects. To avoid such a missile, their opponent must
successfully Test for Luck, or suffer 1 point of STAMINA
damage. The **Poltergeist** may even try to wield a stick or a
weapon (in which case its SKILL score should be used for the
fight). Fighting a **Poltergeist** is rather futile, however, as it
cannot be hit by weapons. The only hope for its opponent is
a fast retreat out of the spirit's range!
