## Description

More powerful still are the **Lich-Lords**, undead warlords and sorcerers who have rejected an existence in the Pit, and instead continue to strive for imposing their grandiose plans of conquest upon the living of Titan.

Some can be faced in combat, using the scores given above, such as Belgaroth the Dread Lord of Ruddlestone, or Mortis of Balthor, villain of the Arrowhead Archipelago (although one may need to hack their way through the Lich-Lord's retinue of chaos creatures, undead soldiers, and attendant demons in order to do so).

Others require more special means of disposal, usually because they have powerful spell-casting abilities, such as Darramouss, infamous dungeon-master of the Yellowstone Mines of Zharradan Marr, who could only be slain by a Ring of Holy Blessing. Even more convoluted was the method to destroy the Night Prince Zanbar Bone, which required a unicorn tattoo, a silver arrow, and a compound of some combination of black pearls, Hag's hair and lotus flower that had to be rubbed into the foul creature's eyes!

For unknown reasons, Liches are especially prevalent in north-western Allansia, and, aside from Darramouss and Zanbar, other examples include Ungoth the Skeleton Lord, servitor-guardian of Razaak the Necromancer, and Quimmel Bone, brother of Zanbar, and insane physician-in-residence aboard the flying ship Galleykeep.

Like all Liches, Lich-Lords are shambling corpses, little more than bones and bits of rotting flesh, animated purely by the malignant willpower of their former occupant's twisted spirit. They can only be harmed by silver or enchanted weapons.
