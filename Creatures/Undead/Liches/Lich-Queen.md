## Description

Some Liches are known as **Lich Queens**, essentially identical in powers to standard Liches, but obviously female and dressed in decaying robes of faded finery. All Liches are capable of speech, and Lich Queens especially will use this ability to lure enemies to their doom by challenging them to feats of strength, such as wearing a gauntlet of pain or other instrument of torture, and murdering them with bone daggers when they fail.

Like all Liches, Lich Queens are shambling corpses, little more than bones and bits of rotting flesh, animated purely by the malignant willpower of their former occupant's twisted spirit. They can only be harmed by silver or enchanted weapons.
