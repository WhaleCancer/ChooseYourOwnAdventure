# Liches

**Source:** CB77008 - Beyond The Pit, Page 81
**Type:** Undead Creatures

---

## Overview

The dreaded **Lich** is one of the most powerful of the corporeal Undead. They are shambling corpses, little more than bones and bits of rotting flesh, animated purely by the malignant willpower of their former occupant's twisted spirit. Despite their resemblance to mere Zombies or Skeletons however, Liches can only be harmed by silver or enchanted weapons.

They were often powerful people in their former existence, able to afford the dark sorceries that gave them the undying life of Lichdom. Now though, they are reduced to skulking about their tombs and crypts, reduced to being undead viziers and stewards, commanding respect from naught but ghosts and shadows.

For unknown reasons, Liches are especially prevalent in north-western Allansia.
