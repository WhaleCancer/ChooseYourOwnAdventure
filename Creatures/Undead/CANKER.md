## Description

The CANKER is an evil monstrosity, an undead remnant of a servant of the Dark Lord Disease. It appears as a festering mass of arm-like pseudopods and seething, rotting flesh, embodying decay and corruption. Its vile stench is so potent that anyone in its vicinity must reduce their SKILL by 2.

The Canker is often accompanied by undead servitors. Roll one die to determine what followers it has:

- **1-3:** 2-12 Plague Zombies (SKILL 5, STAMINA 7)
- **4-5:** 1-6 Decayers (SKILL 7, STAMINA 5)
- **6:** 1-3 Crypt Stalkers (SKILL 8, STAMINA 6)

**Plague of Undeath:** Wounds from a Canker's tentacles cause the "Plague of Undeath," which leads to death and rebirth as a Plague Zombie within 1-3 days. The only cure is a "Heal-all" potion, which restores up to 6 STAMINA and destroys the plague. A hurled Heal-all flask can also destroy a Canker, reducing it to a pool of black slime.

A Canker once lurked in a crypt in Ruddlestone, slain by Gwythain the Protector, though there are rumors of its resurgence.
