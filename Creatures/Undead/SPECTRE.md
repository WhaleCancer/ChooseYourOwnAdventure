Whereas Ghosts are the spirits of the lonely dead, and
Wraiths are tormented souls in constant conflict with their
surroundings, SPECTRES represent some of the most
powerful of the incorporeal Undead; ancient and intensely
evil creatures with a malicious, brooding hatred of all
living things. They appear as shrouded figures with a
ghostly human form, glowing either phosphorescent
green or luminous white. Spectres can glide through the
air, and even through walls, accompanied by a low
moaning sound as they seek out intelligent life to torment
and destroy. Should they encounter a victim they will
immediately attack, shrieking in hatred and rending at
their foe with icy taloned claw-like hands. Anyone who
has been wounded by a Spectre will lose 1 SKILL point at
the end of a battle on the roll of 1 to 5 on a single die
(assuming they survive the fight). This is the result of
having their life energy drained away by the evil creature.
Worse, Spectres can only be harmed by magical weapons;
normal and silver weapons will simply pass straight
through their ethereal form, causing them no damage.
Some alchemists, such as the crazed Mortvanian Doktor
Verruckte, claim that if one can collect the residual essence
of a slain Spectre or Wraith, this can be used to create a
potion that will restore any life energy (or SKILL points),
lost to such creatures. Unfortunately, the potion’s side
effect is those drinking it must reduce their Attack
Strength by 1 in all future battles with Spectres or Wraiths
as they are now more vulnerable to them! More
promisingly, it is possible to create a mixture known as
Spectrebane by combining tomb dust with Ethereal Oil,
and when applied to a magical weapon Spectrebane will
cause 1 extra point of STAMINA damage per wound
inflicted on the Spectre for the first five Attack Rounds.
All of this applies to both Lesser and Greater Spectres.
LESSER SPECTRES are the more commonly occurring of
the two types, relatively speaking, being found in
abandoned temples, forgotten tombs and the like.
GREATER SPECTRES however, are typically the undead
spirits of powerful warriors or spell-casters, condemned
to haunt the site of their doom until slain a second and
final time by a well-equipped adventurer. Examples of
such loathsome fiends include Morgwyn of the Dark
Tower, Queen of Belgaroth, who haunts the ruins of Caer
Skaal and uses foul sorcery to assail her victims; the
undead wizard known as the Master of Waters, who
dwells within the ruined catacombs that tunnel beneath
Solani Island; and the piratical Jack-A-Lantern that lurks
among the crypts in the cemetery of the Port of Crabs.
Interestingly, not all Spectres are immediately hostile:
some hireswords tell of a peculiar Spectre encountered in
the dungeon known as Shaggradd’s Hives of Peril. Rather
than attack, it successfully persuaded the adventurers it
could grant them the magical power of walking through
walls, and was most incredulous and apologetic when this
so-called power failed to work!

GIANT SPIDER
One of the more ubiquitous creatures encountered by
adventurers across Titan is the GIANT SPIDER, a hideous
arachnid of huge size and voracious appetite. Details on
the most common type of Giant Spider can be found in
Out of the Pit (p. 108), but there are other rare species found
in the more isolated and desolate corners of Titan. Three
such examples are given below.
