## Description

The **Dread Knights of the Order of the Black Shroud** number thirteen in total, and their champion Chapter Master wields an evil weapon known as the Mace of Mabuz. The Dread Knights wear archaic armour and use black swords inscribed with red runes. They are also known to use Moon Dogs as guard-animals, and their symbol is a plain sable field. Thought to hail from Bathoria, they were last seen in Ruddlestone, at Castle Valsinore on the Sourstone Peninsula.

Like all Death-Knights, the Dread Knights are vulnerable to sunlight and certain unique magical spells (such as Charms of Unbinding or Words of Power), which will kill them instantly. They are a small but elite order, with only thirteen members, making them one of the most exclusive Death-Knight orders.
