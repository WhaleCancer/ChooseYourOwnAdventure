## Description

Not to be confused with [Chaos Warriors](../../Humanoids/Chaos-Warrior.md) (who are not Undead), the **Chaos Knights of Caer Skaal** serve the evil lord Belgaroth, the Usurping Serpent of Ruddlestone. They wear spiked black armour inlaid with red tracery, and wield a variety of weapons including swords, axes and maces. Many Chaos Knights also ride black war-horses, and their Champion is an expert in jousting with a lance. The symbol of the Chaos Knights is an iron fist holding a black sword.

Like all Death-Knights, the Chaos Knights are vulnerable to sunlight and certain unique magical spells (such as Charms of Unbinding or Words of Power), which will kill them instantly. They are among the most powerful of Death-Knight orders, with high STAMINA and versatile combat abilities.
