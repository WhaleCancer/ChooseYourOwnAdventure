## Description

A **Death-Knight Emissary**, by contrast, operates entirely alone. They are sent by the Demon Princes or even the Dark Lords themselves, to either assassinate a champion of Good or retrieve a powerful magical artefact. Emissaries are clad in full plate armour as black as night, and usually wield a cruelly spiked mace or morning star. Beyond the visor of their battle-helmet lies either empty nothingness or the fires of the Pit, and it is often the last sight their victim sees before they are crushed beneath the Death-Knight's weapon.

Like all Death-Knights, Emissaries are vulnerable to sunlight and certain unique magical spells (such as Charms of Unbinding or Words of Power), which will kill them instantly. They are the most independent of all Death-Knights, operating as solo agents on missions of great importance to their dark masters.
