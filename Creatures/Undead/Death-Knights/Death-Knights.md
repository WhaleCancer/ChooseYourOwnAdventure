## Overview

Some knights forsake the codes of chivalry and valour and throw their lot in with the Dark Lords of Evil and Chaos, such that when they die, they are reborn as undead **Death-Knights**! They become little more than a husk-like corpse clad in full plate-mail and bearing the weapons of their former life. All Death-Knights are powerful and intimidating warriors, but they have two major weaknesses: both sunlight and certain unique magical spells (such as Charms of Unbinding or Words of Power) will kill them instantly. As a result, they band together in formal orders, drawn to the service of a dark lord or evil sorcerer.

The Knights of Alptraum wear coal-black cloaks wrapped around their armoured frames, and wield two-handed greatswords in battle. Their emblem is the symbol of plague: a rotting skull on a black field.

The Knights of the Black Shroud number thirteen in total, and their champion Chapter Master wields an evil weapon known as the Mace of Mabuz. The Dread Knights wear archaic armour and use black swords inscribed with red runes. They are also known to use Moon Dogs as guard-animals, and their symbol is a plain sable field. Thought to hail from Bathoria, they were last seen in Ruddlestone, at Castle Valsinore on the Sourstone Peninsula.
