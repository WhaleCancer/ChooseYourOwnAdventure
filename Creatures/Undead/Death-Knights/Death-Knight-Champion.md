## Description

**Death-Knight Champions** are the elite leaders of Death-Knight orders. They are more powerful than standard Death-Knights, with superior combat abilities and often wielding unique weapons or artifacts. Each order has its own Champion, such as the Chapter Master of the Dread Knights of the Order of the Black Shroud, who wields the evil weapon known as the Mace of Mabuz, or the Champion of the Chaos Knights of Caer Skaal, who is an expert in jousting with a lance.

Like all Death-Knights, Champions are vulnerable to sunlight and certain unique magical spells (such as Charms of Unbinding or Words of Power), which will kill them instantly. They serve as the commanders and most powerful warriors of their respective orders, leading their undead brethren in the service of dark lords and evil sorcerers.
