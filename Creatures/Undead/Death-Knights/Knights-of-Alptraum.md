## Description

The **Knights of Alptraum** are the honour guard of the Lich-Lord Mortis of the Arrowhead Archipelago. Over two hundred and fifty of them were summoned by Mortis to man the battlements of Bloodrise Keep on Stayng Island. The Knights of Alptraum wear coal-black cloaks wrapped around their armoured frames, and wield two-handed greatswords in battle. Their emblem is the symbol of plague: a rotting skull on a black field.

Like all Death-Knights, the Knights of Alptraum are vulnerable to sunlight and certain unique magical spells (such as Charms of Unbinding or Words of Power), which will kill them instantly. They serve as the elite guard of their dark master, Lich-Lord Mortis.
