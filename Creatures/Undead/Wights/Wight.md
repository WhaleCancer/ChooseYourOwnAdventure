## Description

When a great and well-loved lord dies, his most devoted retainers often refuse to acknowledge his passing and continue to serve him, by guarding and keeping order in his crypt. In time they will die, but even in death their obsessive devotion may drive them to serve him. They will return as **Wights** – bestial, inhuman things with wild hair, insane eyes and clawed fingers and toes, still dressed in their rotting livery. **Wights** are powerful creatures, for they are the undead servants of the dead, and can be harmed only by weapons made of solid silver. Normal weapons can hit them, but their wielders will soon realize that they are making no impression on the foul things.

Worse still, their touch is so chilling that it sorely weakens their opponents. For every three wounds a **Wight** inflicts on its victim, it will suck 1 SKILL point from him. Once the **Wight** has killed him, it will dress the corpse in ceremonial robes and sacrifice the energy it has stolen to its dead master, praying hopefully for his return to life.
