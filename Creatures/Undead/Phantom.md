## Description

Just the sight of a **Phantom** stalking through the night,
hidden in its voluminous black cowl, its ghostly lantern
swinging ahead of it, is enough to scare any faint-hearted
being to death. Those brave enough actually to challenge the
godless being will encounter the full extent of its power as it
throws back its hood and reveals its face. A **Phantom** is a
powerful undead spirit, usually found inhabiting a deathless
human body. Its skin is stretched taut across its bones, a sickly
yellow in colour. Its eyes trap attention: blood-red and sunk
into their sockets, they can paralyse those who meet their
powerful gaze.
Anyone looking into the eyes of a **Phantom** must roll his
current SKILL score or less on two dice, or lose 4 STAMINA
points and be paralysed for fifteen minutes. The **Phantom** will
use this time to make good its escape, fleeing away to
continue its haunting elsewhere. If its opponent manages to
survive the gaze and wishes to fight it, he will have another
shock, for the thing is unaffected by blows from normal
weapons. As soon as its opponent misses, or the weapon
passes straight through its body, the **Phantom** will catch his
gaze in its own again, and he will be paralysed. The only hope is to use a silver implement, for the very touch of an object made from this metal will cause the undead being to crumble to dust, its roving spirit finally released to return to the Spirit Plane in peace.
