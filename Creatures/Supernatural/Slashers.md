# Slashers

**Type:** Supernatural phenomenon / Human transformation  
**Origin:** Signal Hour / Frequency Fence exposure  
**Era:** Documented since the 1970s, with earlier cases retroactively identified  
**Media Term:** "Slashers" (as in slasher films)

## Overview

**Slashers** are humans who have been transformed into unstoppable, near-immortal serial killers through exposure to the [Signal Hour](./Phenomena/Signal-Hour.md) and the [Frequency Fence](./Phenomena/Frequency-Fences.md). These individuals become the basis for the "slasher" horror films that have become popular in the 1980s—movies that sanitize and exploit real events for entertainment while hiding the true nature of the phenomenon.

The Frequency Fence, designed by the [Archons](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) to harvest emotional energy and maintain the prison, affects different people in different ways. Most experience emotional depletion, apathy, or spiritual weakening. A small percentage, however, undergo a catastrophic transformation: their emotional energy is not just drained but **inverted**, turning them into vessels of pure rage, hatred, and violence. These individuals become slashers—unstoppable killing machines that generate massive amounts of negative emotional energy (fear, terror, despair) that the Archons can harvest from entire communities.

## The Transformation Process

### Vulnerability Factors

Not everyone exposed to the Signal Hour becomes a slasher. Certain factors increase vulnerability:

- **Pre-existing trauma or mental instability:** Individuals with unresolved trauma, severe mental illness, or a history of violence are more susceptible
- **Isolation and alienation:** People who are socially isolated, rejected, or marginalized are more likely to transform
- **Childhood abuse or neglect:** Those who experienced severe childhood trauma are prime candidates
- **Exposure during critical moments:** Being exposed to the Signal Hour during moments of extreme emotional distress, grief, or rage
- **Genetic predisposition:** Some families seem to have a higher rate of slasher transformation, suggesting possible genetic or hereditary factors
- **Proximity to thin veil areas:** Exposure near [thin veil areas](./Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas.md) increases the likelihood of transformation

### The Signal Hour Trigger

The transformation typically occurs during the Signal Hour (2:00-3:00 AM), when the Frequency Fence operates at peak efficiency. The victim experiences:

- **Intense emotional overload:** All suppressed rage, hatred, and pain surfaces simultaneously
- **Psychic feedback loop:** The Signal Hour creates a feedback loop where negative emotions are amplified and inverted
- **Dimensional bleed:** In thin veil areas, Archon influence directly touches the victim's psyche
- **Identity collapse:** The individual's sense of self is overwhelmed by pure, undirected violence
- **Physical transformation:** The body adapts to become a perfect killing machine—enhanced strength, durability, and regenerative abilities

### Post-Transformation Characteristics

Once transformed, slashers exhibit consistent traits:

- **Superhuman durability:** They can survive injuries that would kill normal humans (gunshots, stabbings, falls, fire)
- **Regenerative abilities:** Wounds heal rapidly, though severe damage may take time
- **Enhanced strength:** Far beyond normal human limits
- **Emotional void:** They feel no pain, fear, remorse, or empathy—only rage and the drive to kill
- **Signature methods:** Each slasher develops a preferred method of killing (knife, machete, chainsaw, etc.)
- **Target selection:** They often target specific types of victims (teenagers, campers, specific locations)
- **Unstoppable persistence:** They cannot be reasoned with, deterred, or stopped through normal means
- **Emotional energy generation:** Their killings create intense fear and terror in communities, generating harvestable emotional energy for Archons

## Known Slashers

### The Camp Crystal Lake Killer (Jason Voorhees)

**Location:** Camp Crystal Lake, New Jersey (though similar cases have been reported in remote BC locations)  
**First Appearance:** 1980  
**Signature:** Machete, hockey mask, targeting campers and teenagers  
**Background:** A drowned child who returned as an unstoppable killer, though the truth is more complex—the original victim's trauma, combined with Signal Hour exposure at the camp (located near a thin veil area), created the slasher. The "returned child" narrative is a sanitized version spread by authorities to hide the true nature of the phenomenon.

**In British Columbia:** Similar cases have been reported at remote summer camps, particularly in areas with thin veil activity. M-EPIC has classified several "camp massacre" incidents as slasher-related, though details are suppressed.

### The Haddonfield Stalker (Michael Myers)

**Location:** Haddonfield, Illinois (though similar cases exist in small BC towns)  
**First Appearance:** 1978  
**Signature:** Kitchen knife, targeting family members and teenagers on Halloween  
**Background:** A child who murdered his sister, institutionalized, then escaped to continue killing. The truth: exposure to Signal Hour broadcasts during his institutionalization, combined with pre-existing psychopathy, triggered the transformation. The "pure evil" narrative hides the Archon influence.

**In British Columbia:** Small towns throughout BC have reported similar "unstoppable stalker" cases, particularly during Halloween or other significant dates. RCMP and M-EPIC maintain files on several active cases.

### The Springwood Slasher (Freddy Krueger)

**Location:** Springwood, Ohio (though dream-based slashers are rarer)  
**First Appearance:** 1984  
**Signature:** Glove with razors, targeting victims in their dreams  
**Background:** A child killer who was burned alive by parents, then returned to kill in dreams. The truth: this slasher represents a more advanced form of the phenomenon—the Signal Hour exposure created a psychic connection that allows the slasher to manifest in the dream realm, where the Frequency Fence's influence is strongest. The "burned killer" narrative is a cover story.

**In British Columbia:** Dream-based slashers are extremely rare but have been documented. M-EPIC maintains a special unit for investigating sleep-related killings and Signal Hour dream manifestations.

### The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Leatherface)

**Location:** Rural Texas (though similar cases exist in remote BC areas)  
**First Appearance:** 1974  
**Signature:** Chainsaw, targeting travelers and outsiders  
**Background:** A family of cannibals who target travelers. The truth: the entire family was affected by Signal Hour exposure in a remote area with strong thin veil activity. The transformation affected multiple family members, creating a "slasher family" rather than a single individual. The isolated location and family trauma created ideal conditions for the transformation.

**In British Columbia:** Remote rural areas, particularly in the Interior and northern regions, have reported similar "family slasher" cases. These are often dismissed as isolated incidents or family violence, but M-EPIC investigators recognize the pattern.

### Other Documented Cases

- **The Prom Night Killer:** A slasher who targets high school proms and dances
- **The Sleepaway Camp Slasher:** Similar to Camp Crystal Lake, targeting summer camps
- **The Urban Stalker:** Slashers who operate in cities, targeting specific neighborhoods or demographics
- **The Highway Killer:** Slashers who target travelers on remote highways
- **The Hospital Slasher:** Medical facility slashers, often former patients or staff

## The Media Cover-Up

The slasher films of the 1980s are based on real events, but heavily sanitized and fictionalized:

- **Real events are turned into entertainment:** Actual killings become "based on true events" horror films
- **Details are changed:** Locations, names, and specific methods are altered to protect the truth
- **Supernatural elements are removed:** The Signal Hour, Frequency Fence, and Archon influence are never mentioned
- **Victims are dehumanized:** Real victims become faceless "teens" in movies, making the horror seem fictional
- **Authorities cooperate:** Law enforcement and government agencies work with studios to ensure the true nature remains hidden
- **Profits fund suppression:** Movie profits are used to fund operations that suppress knowledge of the real phenomenon

The media cover-up serves multiple Archon purposes:
- It makes real slasher events seem like fiction, preventing public awareness
- It generates additional emotional energy through fear and entertainment
- It desensitizes the public to violence, making them more vulnerable to control
- It creates a feedback loop where fear of slashers generates more harvestable energy

## M-EPIC and Law Enforcement Response

**M-EPIC Classification:**
- Slashers are classified as "Signal Hour Anomalies" or "Frequency Fence Transformations"
- Cases are suppressed and sanitized before public release
- Specialized units track slasher activity and attempt containment
- Some slashers are captured and studied, though containment is extremely difficult

**RCMP and Local Law Enforcement:**
- Most officers are unaware of the true nature of slashers
- Cases are treated as extreme serial killer investigations
- Information is classified and restricted
- Officers who encounter slashers often suffer psychological trauma or become targets themselves

**Containment Methods:**
- Slashers are extremely difficult to kill permanently
- Severe dismemberment or complete destruction of the body may stop them temporarily
- Some slashers appear to "resurrect" after apparent death, suggesting dimensional or psychic persistence
- Containment facilities exist but are rarely successful long-term
- Some slashers are "contained" by allowing them to operate in isolated areas where they can be monitored

## Game Considerations

**As Antagonists:**
- Slashers are nearly unstoppable killing machines
- They cannot be reasoned with or deterred
- They have superhuman durability and regenerative abilities
- They generate intense fear and terror
- They may have signature methods, locations, or target types
- They are often tied to specific dates, locations, or events

**Investigation Hooks:**
- A series of killings matches the pattern of a known slasher
- A "slasher film" is discovered to be based on real events
- M-EPIC or RCMP request assistance with a "difficult case"
- A slasher's signature method matches an unsolved case
- Victims report seeing "something from a movie" before death
- A remote location (camp, small town, highway) experiences a series of killings

**The Truth:**
- Slashers are not supernatural monsters but humans transformed by Archon control systems
- The Signal Hour and Frequency Fence are the true source of the phenomenon
- The media cover-up hides the connection to Archon harvesting
- Understanding slashers means understanding the Frequency Fence and Signal Hour
- Stopping slashers may require disrupting the Frequency Fence or Signal Hour broadcasts

**Player Character Options:**
- Characters may have encountered slashers in their past
- Some characters may be investigating the connection between slasher films and real events
- Characters with knowledge of the Signal Hour may recognize slasher patterns
- Characters may need to protect communities from slasher attacks
- Characters may discover that a "slasher film" is actually a cover-up for real events

## In Short

**Slashers are humans transformed into unstoppable killers by the Signal Hour and Frequency Fence. They generate massive amounts of negative emotional energy that the Archons harvest, while the media turns their real killings into entertainment that further desensitizes and controls the public. The slasher films of the 1980s are based on real events, but the truth—that these killers are created by Archon control systems—remains hidden from the public.**
