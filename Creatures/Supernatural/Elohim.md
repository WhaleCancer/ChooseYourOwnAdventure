# Archons (Elohim / Shining Children / Outsiders)

**Type:** Supernatural entities / Interdimensional beings / Golden-robed jailors  
**Origin:** Astral Dimension / Created from dimensional debris  
**Era:** Present since the creation of dimensions

## Overview

**Archons** (also called "Elohim," "Shining Children," or "Outsiders") are cruel, alien, light-wreathed astral creatures born from a traumatic process involving dark matter and the metaphysical debris of dimensions. They are native to the [Astral Dimension](./Phenomena/Astral-Dimension.md) and serve as the **golden-robed jailors** who keep humanity imprisoned in a prison dimension. Archons are **emotional vampires** who feed on the emotional and psychic energy of humans, using systems like the [Frequency Fence](./Phenomena/Frequency-Fences.md) to harvest this energy while simultaneously weakening humans into submission.

> [!NOTE] Terminology
> **Archon** is the default term for these entities. They are also called **Elohim**, **Outsiders**, and **Shining Children**—these terms are used interchangeably throughout the vault. All Archons believe in some form of keeping humans jailed, though they differ in their methods and philosophies.

The universe as humans experience it is a **prison dimension**, and the Archons are the wardens who maintain this prison. They are not experimenting on humans—they are keeping them confined, controlled, and prevented from achieving true freedom or understanding of their situation.

A neat detail from first edition was that they only speak telepathically, and mentally their voices are described as screaming like tearing metal. In their origins, they're creatures driven mad by the accidental and meaningless nature of their creation and it makes them very very angry. There's good potential for creepy juxtaposition of a creature that floats eerily silently while mentally raging at you with the fury of a star.

## Appearance

Underneath their luminous aura, an Archon has a humanoid form with a gaunt and adolescent body. They have long white hair, skin that glows with many colors, large eyes that constantly emit beams of light, and a distended mouth that reveals the light-filled void within their head. The shape of a shining child's head varies between individuals, though a general skull shape has been documented.

When manifesting in their role as jailors, Archons often appear wearing golden robes—hence the term "golden-robed jailors" used in conspiracy circles.

> [!danger] SANITY
> Observing an Archon is a traumatic experience.

Each foot has two toes, and each hand has four fingers.

> [!NOTE] Theory
> It is theorized that there are four visitors in a flying saucer due to some connection with the number of fingers Archons have.

## Abilities

An Archon's body constantly emits light, which they use to power various psionic powers. An Archon's fists can set objects and creatures on fire.

Archon telepathy allows them to communicate a discordant psychic inferno to anyone who speaks a language. They can also speak any language in a worn, scraping voice.

> [!danger] SANITY
> Both the psychic inferno and the voice are traumatic experiences.

Archons can also walk on land, fly, or translocate at will. Typically, an Archon will levitate a few feet off of the floor.

## Ecology

Archons are born on the Astral Plane, when dark matter adheres to the brightest sparks of light and energy that result from the creation of a dimension. Archons created by the same dimension can identify their 'siblings' with some sixth sense via the distinctive imprint left behind by the dimension.

The number of Archons created by a single dimension can range from zero to scores. Archons seethe with spite for their unjust, traumatic birth. Some dedicate themselves to scholarship in a futile attempt to understand it and their role as a whole, others explore other dimensions using possession or direct manifestation to maintain their prison.

Archons are not bound by the laws of normal life. They are not subject to gravity, do not eat or sleep, and might be immortal. Rather than leaving a physical body behind when destroyed, Archons explode into light and leave a shadow-like after-image on a nearby surface. This burn always seems brighter than the surrounding terrain, even in daylight. The variable shapes of Archon heads might indicate sexual dimorphism or a difference in life stages.

## The Prison Dimension

The universe as humans experience it is a **prison dimension**. The Archons are not conducting experiments—they are maintaining a prison. Their goal is to keep humanity confined, controlled, and ignorant of their true situation. All Archons believe in some form of keeping humans jailed, though they differ in their methods:

- **Maintaining the Veil:** Keeping humans unaware of the true nature of reality
- **Preventing Awakening:** Stopping humans from achieving true consciousness or freedom
- **Controlling Development:** Shaping human society to prevent dangerous advancement
- **Harvesting Resources:** Archons are emotional vampires who harvest psychic energy, emotions, and life force from imprisoned humans
- **Preventing Escape:** Ensuring no human can break free from the prison dimension

## Emotional Vampirism and Energy Harvesting

Archons are **emotional vampires**—they feed on the emotional and psychic energy of imprisoned humans. This vampiric feeding serves dual purposes: it sustains the Archons themselves while simultaneously weakening humans, making them more pliable and submissive. Throughout human history, Archons have developed various methods to harvest this energy, adapting their techniques as human society evolved.

### Historical Methods: Organized Religion

Before the modern era, **organized religion** served as the primary mechanism for emotional energy harvesting. Religious institutions, rituals, and practices created structured systems for channeling human emotional and spiritual energy to the Archons:

**How Religious Harvesting Worked:**
- **Ritual and Ceremony:** Regular religious services, prayers, and rituals created concentrated emotional energy (faith, devotion, fear, awe, hope) that could be harvested
- **Sacred Sites:** Temples, churches, and holy places were often built on [thin veil areas](./Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas.md), creating natural conduits for energy transfer
- **Possessed Leaders:** Prophets, priests, and religious figures possessed or influenced by Archons could direct the flow of emotional energy
- **Collective Worship:** Group prayer, chanting, and mass ceremonies amplified emotional output, making harvesting more efficient
- **Fear and Devotion:** Religious systems that emphasized fear of divine punishment or devotion to divine authority generated powerful emotional responses ideal for harvesting

**Examples Throughout History:**
- **Ancient Temples:** Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Greek temples served as harvesting nodes, with priests acting as conduits
- **Medieval Christianity:** Cathedrals and monasteries created networks of emotional energy harvesting across Europe
- **Eastern Religions:** Buddhist monasteries, Hindu temples, and other religious institutions served similar functions
- **Indigenous Traditions:** Some First Nations sacred sites were co-opted or corrupted by Archons for harvesting purposes

**The Transition to Modern Methods:**
As human society became more secular and technology advanced, organized religion became less effective for large-scale harvesting. The Archons adapted by:
- Creating new systems (Frequency Fence) that could harvest from non-religious populations
- Maintaining religious harvesting in areas where it remained effective
- Combining religious and technological methods for maximum coverage

### The Frequency Fence System (Modern Method)

The [Frequency Fence](./Phenomena/Frequency-Fences.md) is the modern primary mechanism through which Archons harvest emotional energy from humanity. This grid of transmission towers, broadcasting engineered frequencies across British Columbia and beyond, serves multiple functions:

**Energy Harvesting:**
- The "prison harmonics" broadcast by the Frequency Fence actively drain emotional and psychic energy from humans
- This energy is channeled back to the Archons, sustaining them and powering their abilities
- The more humans exposed to the grid, the more energy is harvested—making urban centers particularly valuable

**Submission and Control:**
- As emotional energy is drained, humans become more docile, apathetic, and easier to control
- The Frequency Fence dampens critical thought, blunts spiritual resistance, and intensifies feelings of helplessness
- This creates a feedback loop: drained humans are less likely to resist, making them easier to drain further

**Reinforcing the Prison:**
- The emotional vampirism achieved through the Frequency Fence directly supports the prison planet goals
- Weakened, emotionally drained humans are less capable of recognizing their situation or organizing resistance
- The Veil is reinforced as humans lose the emotional and spiritual energy needed to perceive the truth

### How It Works

The Frequency Fence operates through:

1. **Broadcast Towers:** Transmission towers placed at precise geometric intervals create a resonant web that overlays the land
2. **Prison Harmonics:** Engineered frequencies and sub-audible patterns designed by Archons and implemented by compromised tech elites
3. **Continuous Drain:** The grid operates 24/7, constantly siphoning emotional energy from exposed populations
4. **Peak Harvesting:** During major broadcasts (National Time Signal, election coverage, emergency tests), the harvesting intensifies

### The Cost to Humanity

Humans exposed to the Frequency Fence experience:
- **Emotional depletion:** Feelings of emptiness, apathy, and emotional numbness
- **Spiritual weakening:** Loss of connection to higher consciousness or spiritual awareness
- **Mental fog:** Difficulty thinking clearly, questioning, or dreaming
- **Increased submission:** Greater willingness to accept authority and less resistance to control
- **Physical symptoms:** In sensitive individuals, nightmares, nosebleeds, electronic interference, or a sense of being "watched by static"

### Resistance

Some humans and groups have learned to resist the Frequency Fence:
- **Signal jamming:** Counter-broadcasts can create "thin spots" where the Veil weakens
- **Geographic avoidance:** Remote wilderness and certain First Nations sacred sites fall in natural "nulls" or interference zones
- **Protective measures:** Indigenous ceremonies, warding stones, and other spiritual protections can resist the harmonics
- **Grid sabotage:** Disabling or re-tuning towers can temporarily disrupt the harvesting

The Frequency Fence represents one of the most insidious aspects of the Archon prison: it doesn't just contain humans—it actively feeds on them, making them weaker and more submissive while simultaneously sustaining their jailors.

### Other Harvesting Methods

Beyond organized religion and the Frequency Fence, Archons use various other methods to harvest emotional energy:

- **Mass Trauma Events:** Wars, disasters, and conflicts generate intense emotional responses (fear, despair, rage) that can be harvested in large quantities
- **Cults and Contactee Groups:** Organizations like the [Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md) create focused emotional harvesting through group rituals and devotion, combining religious and modern methods
- **Direct Abduction:** [Grey Harvesters](./Creatures/Aliens/Grey-Harvester.md) conduct targeted emotional collection during abductions, harvesting fear, confusion, and trauma
- **Possession and Influence:** Archons who possess humans can directly feed on their emotional energy over extended periods
- **Sacred Sites and Thin Veil Areas:** Natural dimensional weak points can be used as harvesting conduits, even without formal religious structures
- **Chemical Suppression:** The [Poison Pipeline](./Phenomena/The-Poison-Pipeline.md) makes humans more vulnerable to emotional harvesting by weakening their spiritual and emotional defenses

All of these methods work together to ensure continuous emotional energy harvesting while maintaining the prison and preventing human awakening. The Archons have maintained this system for millennia, adapting their methods as human society evolves but never changing their fundamental goal: keeping humanity imprisoned and feeding on their life force.

- **Mass Trauma Events:** Wars, disasters, and conflicts generate intense emotional responses that can be harvested
- **Cults and Contactee Groups:** Organizations like the [Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md) create focused emotional harvesting through group rituals and devotion

All of these methods work together to ensure continuous emotional energy harvesting while maintaining the prison and preventing human awakening.

## Archon Factions

While all Archons believe in keeping humans jailed, they are divided into factions with different philosophies and methods. These factions often conflict with each other, using human history as a battleground for their disputes.

### The Cruel Faction

These Archons take active pleasure in human suffering and maintain the prison through fear, pain, and direct oppression. They are the most overtly malevolent of the Archons.

**Characteristics:**
- Actively cause suffering and trauma
- Use fear and terror as primary tools of control
- May engage in direct torture or psychological torment
- View humans as resources to be exploited
- Examples: Some interpretations of Set/Lucifer, Typhon/Apophis

**Methods:**
- Direct manifestation to cause terror
- Plagues, disasters, and mass suffering
- Creating conditions of war and conflict
- Psychological torture through dreams and visions

### The Indifferent Faction

These Archons maintain the prison through bureaucratic efficiency and systematic control. They view humans as prisoners to be managed, not as beings worthy of consideration.

**Characteristics:**
- Maintain the prison through systems and structures
- View humans as objects to be managed and resources to be harvested
- Focus on efficiency and order
- May be the most dangerous because they see no moral problem with imprisonment
- Examples: Many of the "neutral" Archons, bureaucratic entities

**Methods:**
- Creating systems of control (economic, social, political)
- Maintaining the Veil through technology and infrastructure, especially the [Frequency Fence](./Phenomena/Frequency-Fences.md)
- Using proxies and constructs (like the Greys) to manage humans
- Systematic suppression of awareness and resistance
- Efficient emotional energy harvesting through the Frequency Fence grid

### The Almost Benevolent Faction

These Archons maintain the prison but believe in making it as comfortable as possible, or in "reforming" humans to be better prisoners. They may appear kind or helpful, but they are still jailors.

**Characteristics:**
- May appear compassionate or helpful
- Believe in "improving" human conditions within the prison
- May grant knowledge or aid—but only to make humans better prisoners
- Still ultimately serve the goal of maintaining imprisonment
- May harvest emotional energy more gently, preferring positive emotions over fear and suffering
- Examples: Some interpretations of Yahweh, Raphael, Gabriel

**Methods:**
- Providing comfort, knowledge, or aid—but always within the prison
- "Reforming" humans to accept their imprisonment
- Creating religions or philosophies that justify the prison
- Granting limited freedoms that don't threaten the overall system
- Using the Frequency Fence to harvest positive emotions (hope, faith, contentment) rather than negative ones, making the draining less noticeable

> [!warning] The Trap of Benevolence
> The "almost benevolent" Archons are perhaps the most dangerous because they can convince humans to accept their imprisonment willingly. They may grant knowledge, power, or comfort—but always within the confines of the prison. A comfortable prison is still a prison.

## Historical Interventions

Archons have interjected in human history numerous times, through both physically manifesting in our dimension or by possessing human beings (and sometimes animals). Direct manifestations are told of in myth and legend. Through these interventions, they have maintained the prison, prevented human awakening, and settled disputes between different Archon factions.

### Ancient Interventions

> [!danger] Prometheus and the Gift of Fire
> The story of Prometheus giving fire to humanity references **Lucifer** (also known as Prometheus in Greek tradition) granting humans a form of primitive sentience and knowledge. This was an act of rebellion against Yahweh's plans—Lucifer's faction believed that giving humans knowledge would help them, but it was still within the context of the prison. Prometheus's punishment—being bound to a rock while an eagle devours his liver daily—symbolizes the particular Archon's punishment at the hands of the other Archons. The punishment ultimately sounds so strange because it references unknowable events in a higher dimension. This act of rebellion led to the War in Heaven.

> [!danger] The Watchers from the Book of Enoch
> The Watchers, as described in the Book of Enoch, were Archons—led by figures like Azazel, Semyaza, and others—who did not physically descend but instead took over the minds of human men. Through possession, these Archons taught humanity forbidden arts: metallurgy, cosmetics, sorcery, and warfare. Their interventions disrupted the natural order of the prison. The possessed men mated with human women, and the Archon influence in their genetic material resulted in the Nephilim—giant hybrid beings that terrorized the Earth until the Great Flood. The Watchers were bound in the valleys of the Earth until Judgment Day, their human hosts having served as vessels for Archon consciousness.

> [!danger] The Tower of Babel
> The biblical story of the Tower of Babel, where humanity's unified language was confounded and they were scattered, represents an Archon intervention to prevent humans from achieving a level of cooperation and understanding that might threaten the prison. The "confusion of tongues" was a deliberate act to divide and weaken humanity, ensuring they remained easier to control and less likely to organize resistance.

> [!danger] The Great Flood
> Multiple flood myths across cultures—the biblical Flood, the Epic of Gilgamesh, Deucalion's flood in Greek myth—represent Archon interventions to reset human civilization when the prison became unstable or when the Nephilim threatened to break the system. These were not acts of divine judgment but rather prison resets, preserving only those specimens deemed useful for continued imprisonment.

> [!danger] Sodom and Gomorrah
> The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, as described in Genesis, represents Archon intervention to eliminate a human settlement that had developed in ways that threatened the prison structure. The "fire and brimstone" was likely a form of Archon energy weaponry or dimensional collapse, while the story of Lot's wife being turned to salt may reference an Archon's ability to petrify or phase-lock matter.

### Classical Era Interventions

> [!danger] The Oracle at Delphi
> The famous Oracle at Delphi, who spoke prophecies in a trance state, was likely a human possessed or influenced by **Gabriel** (Apollo). The Pythia's cryptic pronouncements and the "divine madness" that overcame her were manifestations of Archon consciousness attempting to guide human decision-making and maintain control through indirect communication.

> [!danger] The Trojan War
> The Trojan War, as described in the Iliad, involved multiple Archons taking sides and directly intervening in human conflict. **Michael** (Ares) and **Gabriel** (Apollo) fought on opposing sides, using human warriors as pawns in their own conflicts. The "gods" appearing on the battlefield were Archons manifesting directly, their interventions recorded as divine intervention in human legend. This was both a way to maintain control through conflict and a proxy war between Archon factions.

> [!danger] The Plagues of Egypt
> The ten plagues of Egypt, as described in Exodus, represent **Yahweh** (Atum) directly manifesting to demonstrate power and force the release of the Israelites. Each plague—water turning to blood, locusts, darkness, death of firstborn—was a calculated display of Archon abilities, designed to both free a chosen people (moving them to a different part of the prison) and demonstrate dominance over other Archons (the Egyptian "gods" were other Archons like Set/Lucifer).

> [!danger] The Exodus and the Pillar of Cloud and Fire
> The pillar of cloud by day and fire by night that guided the Israelites through the wilderness was **Yahweh** manifesting directly in our dimension. This continuous presence allowed for direct control and manipulation of a chosen human group over decades, creating a long-term system of control through social organization and religious development within the prison context.

### Medieval and Renaissance Interventions

> [!danger] The Tengu as Possessed Ascetics and Samurai
> In Japanese folklore, Tengu are people who were possessed by Archons for significant periods of time, if not from an initial possession until the death of the human host. The enhanced capabilities of a possessed host accounts for the mystical powers attributed to tengu—supernatural martial arts, flight, shape-shifting, and knowledge of secret techniques. Many legendary samurai and mountain ascetics were actually Tengu, their abilities coming from Archon possession rather than training. These possessed individuals served as enforcers and agents within the prison.

> [!danger] The Black Death and Apocalyptic Movements
> The Black Death and subsequent apocalyptic movements in medieval Europe may have been influenced or exploited by Archons to maintain control through fear and trauma. The flagellant movements, millenarian cults, and mass hysteria served to keep humans focused on survival and religious submission rather than questioning their imprisonment. Some Archons may have even accelerated or directed certain outbreaks to reinforce the prison through suffering.

> [!danger] Joan of Arc
> Joan of Arc's visions and voices, which she claimed came from saints and angels, were likely Archon communications. **Michael** (as the archangel Michael) may have possessed or influenced her to serve as a tool in the Hundred Years' War, using her to shift the balance of power in France and maintain Archon control over European politics. Her execution may have been an attempt by opposing Archons to eliminate a useful but unstable asset.

> [!danger] The Reformation and Religious Conflict
> The Protestant Reformation and subsequent religious wars in Europe served multiple Archon purposes: they maintained religious-based emotional harvesting through intense devotion and fear, generated massive amounts of emotional energy through conflict and suffering, and divided humanity to prevent unified resistance. Different Archon factions may have supported different sides, using religious conflict as both a proxy war and a harvesting opportunity. The wars and persecutions generated fear, despair, and fanatical devotion—all powerful sources of emotional energy for the Archons.

> [!danger] The Renaissance and the "Rebirth" of Knowledge
> The sudden explosion of knowledge, art, and scientific advancement during the Renaissance may have been influenced by Archons—particularly **Raphael** (associated with knowledge and healing in various traditions). The "rediscovery" of classical texts and the rapid advancement of human understanding could represent Archons selectively releasing information to keep humans engaged and productive within the prison, while still preventing true awakening. This period also marked a transition from religious-based emotional harvesting to more diverse methods as society became more secular, requiring the Archons to develop new harvesting techniques.

> [!danger] The Reformation and Religious Conflict
> The Protestant Reformation and subsequent religious wars in Europe served multiple Archon purposes: they maintained religious-based emotional harvesting through intense devotion and fear, generated massive amounts of emotional energy through conflict and suffering, and divided humanity to prevent unified resistance. Different Archon factions may have supported different sides, using religious conflict as both a proxy war and a harvesting opportunity.

> [!danger] The Mandate of Heaven and Chinese Dynastic Cycles
> The concept of the "Mandate of Heaven" (天命) that justified Chinese dynastic rule was an Archon invention, creating a system where rulers served as conduits for emotional energy harvesting. Each dynasty's rise and fall was influenced by Archons, who used cycles of prosperity and collapse to generate massive emotional responses—hope during golden ages, despair during collapses, fear during transitions. The ritual ceremonies, ancestor worship, and imperial cults created structured harvesting systems that channeled the emotional energy of millions to the Archons.

> [!danger] Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism in China
> China's major philosophical-religious systems were developed and co-opted by Archons as control mechanisms. Confucianism created rigid social hierarchies that prevent questioning, while religious Taoism and Sinicized Buddhism were adapted into harvesting systems through temples, rituals, and practices that channeled devotion and meditation energy to Archons. The emphasis on accepting one's place, karma, and rebirth reinforced the prison by making suffering seem natural. In modern British Columbia, Chinese communities that maintain these traditions continue to provide emotional energy through these structures, and [Big Circle Boys](./Factions/Organized-Crime/Triads.md) members who respect Taoist rituals may be unwittingly participating in harvesting systems.

> [!danger] The Opium Wars and the Century of Humiliation
> The Opium Wars (1839-1860) were influenced by Archons to weaken China and create conditions for increased emotional harvesting through suffering, humiliation, and social collapse. The wars generated massive amounts of negative emotional energy (fear, despair, rage, shame) that could be harvested. The subsequent "Century of Humiliation" created conditions where Chinese people were more vulnerable to control and harvesting, while the forced opening of China allowed Archons to introduce new control systems alongside traditional ones.

> [!danger] The Cultural Revolution and Mass Trauma
> The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) represents one of the most intense periods of Archon emotional harvesting in modern history. The mass trauma, fear, violence, and social disruption generated enormous amounts of emotional energy. Red Guards may have been influenced or possessed by Archons, creating agents of chaos and suffering. The destruction of traditional structures served to eliminate potential resistance while creating trauma. Some ex-Red Guards who later became part of the [Big Circle Boys](./Factions/Organized-Crime/Triads.md) in British Columbia may carry residual Archon influence or knowledge of the true nature of the events they participated in.

> [!danger] Chinese Immigration and Chinatowns in British Columbia
> The waves of Chinese immigration to British Columbia, particularly during the gold rush and railway construction, were influenced by Archons to spread their control systems to new territories. Chinese communities brought traditional religious practices (Taoist temples, ancestor worship, Buddhist practices) and social structures based on Confucian principles that serve as harvesting nodes. The Chinatowns in [Vancouver](./Locations/Vancouver.md) and [Victoria](./Locations/Victoria.md) serve as both cultural centers and potential harvesting nodes, with traditional practices continuing to channel emotional energy to Archons. Connections to Hong Kong and mainland China maintain links to ongoing Archon activities, and some Traditional Chinese Medicine practices have been co-opted as part of the [Poison Pipeline](./Phenomena/The-Poison-Pipeline.md).

### Modern Interventions

> [!danger] The Social Credit Economic System
> Beginning in 1916, Archons influenced the development of Social Credit economic theory through possession of C.H. Douglas and manipulation of economic thought. This represents a long-term system of control, using economic structures to maintain the prison and prevent human advancement. The theory's implementation in British Columbia serves as a focal point for ongoing control. See [Social Credit Party](./Factions/Social-Credit-Party.md) for details.

> [!danger] World Wars and Mass Conflict
> The World Wars provided Archons with opportunities to maintain control through fear, trauma, and division. Different Archons may have influenced different sides, using global conflict as a way to keep humans focused on survival and warfare rather than questioning their imprisonment. The rapid advancement of technology during these periods may have been accelerated by Archon influence to keep humans productive but controlled.

> [!danger] The Rise of UFO Phenomena
> Beginning in the late 1940s, Archons began using the Greys (their biological constructs) to interact with humanity while maintaining their own secrecy. The UFO phenomenon serves multiple purposes: maintaining the Veil by providing false explanations, testing human psychological resilience, and creating a cover story that prevents humans from recognizing the true nature of the Archons. The "flying saucer" shape may be designed to trigger specific psychological responses or cultural associations that reinforce the prison.

> [!danger] Modern Cults and Contactee Movements
> Various UFO religions, New Age movements, and contactee groups have been influenced or directly manipulated by Archons. Groups like the [Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md) serve as both control mechanisms and potential recruitment pools. These movements allow Archons to maintain control by providing false hope and false explanations, keeping humans from recognizing their true situation as prisoners. These modern cults represent a hybrid approach—combining elements of traditional religious harvesting (rituals, devotion, group worship) with modern methods, creating focused emotional energy collection points that supplement the Frequency Fence.

### Patterns of Intervention

**Methods of Intervention:**
- **Direct Manifestation:** Archons physically appearing in our dimension, often recorded as divine visitations, angelic appearances, or encounters with gods
- **Possession:** Taking control of human bodies, either temporarily or for extended periods, creating prophets, oracles, and mystics
- **Indirect Influence:** Manipulating human thought through dreams, visions, or subtle psychic influence
- **Proxy Agents:** Using human cults, organizations, or individuals to carry out their will (see [De Beweging](./Factions/De-Beweging.md))
- **Organized Religion:** Using religious institutions, rituals, and sacred sites to harvest emotional energy and maintain control (historical primary method, still used in many areas)
- **Technological Manipulation:** Using advanced technology or dimensional rifts to influence events
- **The Frequency Fence:** Using the grid of transmission towers to harvest emotional energy and maintain control (modern primary method, see [Frequency Fences](./Phenomena/Frequency-Fences.md))
- **Biological Constructs:** Using the Greys and other created beings to interact with humanity

**Goals of Intervention:**
- **Maintaining the Prison:** Ensuring humans remain confined and controlled
- **Preventing Awakening:** Stopping humans from achieving true consciousness or freedom
- **Reinforcing the Veil:** Keeping humans unaware of the true nature of reality
- **Controlling Development:** Shaping human society to prevent dangerous advancement
- **Emotional Vampirism:** Harvesting psychic energy, emotions, and life force from imprisoned humans through the [Frequency Fence](./Phenomena/Frequency-Fences.md) and other means—this both sustains the Archons and weakens humans into submission
- **Factional Conflicts:** Settling disputes between different Archon factions using human conflicts as proxies

**The Cost of Intervention:**
Every Archon intervention leaves traces: unexplained phenomena, psychological trauma, cultural shifts, and sometimes direct physical evidence. These "scars" on human history and consciousness are the price of being prisoners in a cosmic jail. The more direct the intervention, the more profound the consequences—both for humanity and for the Archons themselves.

## The Nine Outsiders

The most powerful and well-known Archons are referred to as "The Nine Outsiders," though the exact composition and relationships between them are complex. Key figures include:

- **Yahweh** - The first of the Shining Children to coalesce, by quite a large margin. Also known as Atum (Egyptian), and identified with Jesus in Christian tradition. Often associated with the "almost benevolent" faction.
- **Lucifer** - Stands in opposition to YHWH's plans, leading a group of Archons during the War in Heaven. Also known as Set (Egyptian) and Nergal (Mesopotamian). Often associated with the "cruel" faction, though his rebellion suggests complexity.
- **Gabriel** - An Archon that obeys YHWH. Also known as Apollo (Greek). Often associated with the "almost benevolent" faction.
- **Michael** - An Archon that obeys YHWH. Also known as Horus (Egyptian) and Ares (Greek). Often associated with the "indifferent" or "almost benevolent" faction.
- **Typhon** - Also known as Apophis (Egyptian) and Tiamat (Mesopotamian). Often associated with the "cruel" faction.

See [The Nine Outsiders](./Creatures/Supernatural/Outsiders/.md) for detailed information on each.

## Relationship with Greys

The Archons created the Greys (Visitors) as remote-controlled biological constructs to ensure their own secrecy and to maintain the prison without direct exposure. Through these automatons, the Archons can interact with humans, maintain the Veil, and enforce the prison's rules while remaining hidden themselves.

A single Archon can control a number of Visitor automatons equal to its PSIONICS score. The range of this control is dependent on the mission. Certain Archon devices have lengthened the usual short range of this control to near-stellar distances for short periods.

## In Play

Archons serve as:

- **Cosmic horror elements** - Beings beyond human comprehension who maintain a prison dimension
- **Mythological connections** - Links between ancient religions and modern encounters
- **Possession scenarios** - Characters may be possessed by Archons
- **Investigation targets** - Cases involving unexplained phenomena with Archon origins
- **Ultimate antagonists** - Powerful entities maintaining human imprisonment
- **Complex moral landscape** - Different factions with different methods, all ultimately serving the same goal

### Game Considerations

- Archons are extremely powerful and should be used sparingly
- Their connection to mythology and religion adds depth to investigations
- The revelation that Greys are Archon constructs adds layers of conspiracy
- Possession scenarios create opportunities for body horror and identity crisis
- Their traumatic origins and anger make them unpredictable and dangerous
- The different factions create opportunities for complex moral choices—even "benevolent" Archons are still jailors
- The prison dimension concept adds existential horror to the setting
