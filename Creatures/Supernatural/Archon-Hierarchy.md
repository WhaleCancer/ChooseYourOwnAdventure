# Archon Hierarchy

**Type:** Supernatural organization / Cosmic structure  
**Era:** Present since the creation of dimensions

## Overview

The Archons operate in a hierarchical structure, with different types of entities serving different roles in maintaining the prison dimension and controlling humanity.

## The Hierarchy

### The Source: Archons (also Shadow People)

The highest level of the hierarchy. The Archons themselves are the golden-robed jailors who maintain the prison dimension. They are the source of all control and manipulation.

### Mantids

Can contain more of an Archon's essence than other constructs. More powerful and independent than Greys, but still ultimately controlled by Archons.

### Greys

Biological constructs created by Archons to serve as their hands in the physical world. They are remote-controlled automatons with no will of their own.

### Robotic Explorers

True robots, since the Archons can stretch themselves only so much. These are the Tall Robotic Explorers, advanced scout units deployed in remote areas.

### Men in Black

Human-alien hybrids or possessed humans who serve as enforcers and cover-up agents. They work to suppress evidence and silence witnesses.

### Time Travelers

Cigarette Smoking Hot Women Time Travelers - Women from a post-nuclear future sent back in time to repopulate Earth. They come from a time after the Archons were destroyed in a cataclysmic war.

## The Judge

**The Judge** is a figure or authority among the Archons to whom other Archons (or cultists) report. Seen in visions as the tallest in golden robes or the central voice during possessions. The Judge represents the highest authority among the Archons, overseeing the maintenance of the prison and the enforcement of the Veil.
