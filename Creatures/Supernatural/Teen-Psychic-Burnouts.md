# Teen Psychic Burnouts

**Type:** Supernatural phenomenon / Human condition  
**Affected Population:** Teenagers and young adults with psionic abilities  
**Era:** Documented since the 1970s, increasing in frequency  
**Related:** [[RULES/Psionics|Psionics]], [[Phenomena/Signal-Hour|Signal Hour]], [[Phenomena/Frequency-Fences|Frequency Fence]]

## Overview

**Teen Psychic Burnouts** are young psionicists who have pushed their abilities too far, been corrupted by Dark Temptation, or been drained by the Frequency Fence to the point of permanent damage. These individuals represent one of the most tragic aspects of psionic awakening in the EPIC setting—teenagers who discover they have powers, use them recklessly or are exploited, and then suffer catastrophic mental, physical, or spiritual collapse.

The phenomenon is particularly common among teenagers because:
- **Adolescent brains are still developing**, making them more vulnerable to psionic feedback and psychic trauma
- **Teenagers lack the discipline and training** needed to safely use psionic abilities
- **Peer pressure and emotional volatility** lead to overuse and pushing powers beyond safe limits
- **The Signal Hour affects teens more strongly**—their developing minds are more sensitive to Frequency Fence broadcasts
- **Wild psionics** (untrained, explosive powers) are more common in teenagers who haven't learned control

## How Burnouts Form

### 1. Overuse and Pushing Powers

Teenagers with psionic abilities often push their powers beyond safe limits, especially when:
- **Trying to impress peers** or gain social acceptance
- **Facing bullying or threats** and using powers defensively
- **Experiencing emotional crises** and using powers to escape or control situations
- **Experimenting** with the limits of their abilities

**The Mechanics:**
- Each time a psionicist "pushes" a power (spending extra PSI points for bonuses), they risk drawing on Dark Temptation
- Teenagers are more likely to push powers repeatedly without understanding the consequences
- Overuse depletes PSI points faster than they can recover, leading to exhaustion and vulnerability
- Repeated pushing increases the chance of fumbles, which can cause permanent damage

**Result:** The teenager's PSIONICS characteristic may be permanently reduced, or they may suffer from psionic fumble effects that never fully heal.

### 2. Dark Temptation and Taint

Teenagers are particularly vulnerable to Dark Temptation because:
- **They lack the wisdom** to resist the easy path to power
- **They're desperate** for control in a world that doesn't understand them
- **They're isolated** and may not have mentors to guide them
- **The corruption feels good**—Dark Temptation offers immediate power when they feel powerless

**The Process:**
- A teenager taps Dark Temptation to gain bonuses or extra PSI points
- They fail the LUCK test, losing permanent LUCK or being compelled to act in corrupt ways
- If they roll double 6, they become **Tainted**
- Tainted teenagers find it easier to call on Dark Temptation, creating a feedback loop
- Eventually, another double 6 may cause them to become an NPC, fully aligned with alien or occult forces

**Result:** The teenager becomes increasingly corrupted, losing their humanity and free will. They may become agents of the Archons, cultists, or completely catatonic from the spiritual damage.

### 3. Psionic Fumbles and Catastrophic Failure

Teenagers are more likely to fumble psionic tests because:
- **They lack training** and proper technique
- **They're emotionally unstable**, affecting their concentration
- **They push powers** beyond their skill level
- **The Signal Hour** interferes with their abilities, causing fumbles

**Catastrophic Fumble Results:**
- **Temporary PSIONICS reduction** that never fully recovers
- **PSIONICS dropping to 0** permanently, leaving them unable to use powers
- **Something from outside notices**—Archons, Greys, or other entities become aware of them
- **Psychic flares** that damage themselves and others
- **Ongoing hallucinations** or psychic echoes that never fade

**Result:** The teenager may lose their powers entirely, suffer permanent mental damage, or become a beacon for hostile entities.

### 4. Frequency Fence Drainage

Teenagers with psionic abilities are prime targets for the Frequency Fence because:
- **They have more emotional/psychic energy** to harvest
- **Their developing minds** are more vulnerable to the prison harmonics
- **They're often awake during Signal Hour** (2-3 AM), making them exposed
- **Their powers make them "visible"** to the harvesting system

**The Process:**
- The Frequency Fence actively drains PSI points and emotional energy from exposed psionicists
- Teenagers may not realize they're being drained until it's too late
- Repeated exposure during Signal Hour can cause permanent PSIONICS reduction
- The drainage weakens their resistance to Dark Temptation and fumbles
- Some teenagers become "empty vessels"—their powers are completely drained, leaving them catatonic or emotionally dead

**Result:** The teenager's psionic abilities are permanently reduced or eliminated, and they may suffer from emotional emptiness, apathy, or spiritual death.

### 5. Wild Psionics and Untrained Powers

Many teenagers develop **Wild Psionics**—untrained, explosive abilities that are as much curse as blessing:
- **Uncontrolled bursts** of power that can't be directed
- **Fire-starting** or other dangerous manifestations
- **EMP shocks** that damage electronics
- **Raw telekinetic waves** that affect everything nearby

**The Danger:**
- Wild psionics are more likely to fumble because they can't be controlled
- Each use risks catastrophic failure
- The teenager may accidentally harm themselves or others
- They become isolated and afraid to use their powers, leading to repression and eventual burnout
- Some teenagers try to suppress their powers, causing internal damage

**Result:** The teenager either loses control completely (becoming a danger to themselves and others) or represses their powers so hard that they burn out from the internal conflict.

### 6. Alien Abduction and Experimentation

Some teenagers develop psionic abilities after [[Phenomena/Alien-Abductions|alien abductions]] or contact with alien artifacts:
- **Grey experiments** may awaken or enhance psionic potential
- **Alien implants** can create artificial psionic abilities
- **Exposure to alien technology** may trigger latent powers
- **Archon influence** may grant powers as part of a larger plan

**The Process:**
- The teenager gains powers but doesn't understand them
- The alien origin of the powers makes them unstable or corrupted
- They may be "marked" by the entities that gave them powers
- The powers may be designed to fail or cause burnout as part of an experiment
- The teenager becomes a target for further abduction or manipulation

**Result:** The teenager's powers are unstable, corrupted, or designed to cause burnout. They may become a "failed experiment" that the Greys or Archons discard, or they may be marked for further study.

### 7. Emotional and Psychological Trauma

Teenagers with psionic abilities often suffer from:
- **Isolation**—they can't tell anyone about their powers
- **Fear**—they're afraid of what they can do or what might happen to them
- **Guilt**—they may have accidentally hurt someone with their powers
- **Pressure**—they may be pressured to use their powers by peers, family, or authorities
- **Identity crisis**—they don't know who they are anymore

**The Process:**
- The psychological stress affects their ability to use powers safely
- They may push powers to escape emotional pain, leading to burnout
- The trauma makes them more vulnerable to Dark Temptation
- They may develop mental health issues that compound the problem
- Some teenagers become completely catatonic from the psychological overload

**Result:** The teenager suffers from severe mental health issues, may lose their powers, or may become completely non-functional.

## M-EPIC and Authority Response

**M-EPIC Classification:**
- Burnouts are classified as "Psionic Casualties" or "Frequency Fence Victims"
- Cases are suppressed to prevent public awareness of psionics
- Some burnouts are taken into custody for study or containment
- M-EPIC maintains facilities for "rehabilitation" that are often just containment centers

**Medical and Psychiatric Response:**
- Most doctors don't recognize psionic burnout as a real condition
- Teenagers are diagnosed with schizophrenia, catatonia, or other mental illnesses
- Treatment is often ineffective because it doesn't address the psionic component
- Some teenagers are institutionalized indefinitely

**Family and Community Response:**
- Families often don't understand what happened
- Communities may ostracize or fear the teenager
- Some families are pressured to keep quiet about the incident
- Teenagers may be sent away or hidden to avoid embarrassment

## Prevention and Recovery

**Prevention:**
- Early training and mentorship for teenage psionicists
- Education about the dangers of pushing powers and Dark Temptation
- Protection from Signal Hour exposure (signal jamming, protective measures)
- Support networks to prevent isolation and trauma
- Monitoring for signs of burnout before it's too late

**Recovery (Rare):**
- Some burnouts can partially recover with proper care
- Recovery requires addressing both psionic and psychological damage
- May require specialized treatment from M-EPIC or other organizations
- Recovery is often incomplete—the teenager may never fully regain their powers or mental health
- Some burnouts become mentors to prevent others from suffering the same fate

## Game Considerations

**As NPCs:**
- Burnouts can serve as warnings or tragic figures
- They may have fragments of information about psionics, Signal Hour, or Archons
- Some burnouts may still have limited or unstable powers
- They may be targets for further exploitation or study

**As Player Characters:**
- A player character might be a recovering burnout
- They may have reduced PSIONICS or limited abilities
- They may have ongoing complications from their burnout
- They may be seeking revenge, understanding, or prevention

**Investigation Hooks:**
- A series of teenage burnouts in a specific area (Signal Hour hotspot)
- A support group or safe house for teenage psionicists
- M-EPIC facility that claims to "rehabilitate" burnouts
- A mentor trying to prevent burnouts by training teenagers
- A cult or organization that exploits teenage psionicists, causing burnouts

**The Truth:**
- Burnouts are a direct result of Archon control systems (Frequency Fence, Signal Hour)
- The phenomenon is increasing as the Frequency Fence expands
- Authorities suppress knowledge to prevent public awareness
- Understanding burnouts means understanding the true cost of psionic abilities in the EPIC setting

## In Short

**Teen Psychic Burnouts are teenagers who have pushed their psionic abilities too far, been corrupted by Dark Temptation, drained by the Frequency Fence, or suffered catastrophic failures. They represent the tragic cost of psionic awakening in a world controlled by Archons—young people who discover they have powers, use them recklessly or are exploited, and then suffer permanent mental, physical, or spiritual collapse. The phenomenon is increasing, and authorities work to suppress knowledge of it while the Archons continue to harvest emotional energy from the suffering.**
