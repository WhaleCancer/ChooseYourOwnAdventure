## Description

GIANT LEECHES are found among the still, rank backwa-
ters of marshes and swamps across Allansia, Kakhabad and
beyond. Disgustingly soft and tube-like, almost half a metre
long, they swim leisurely around the brackish creeks, await-
ing a warm-blooded creature to feed upon. When one passes,
they latch on to it with tiny, hook-like teeth and begin to suck
its blood. Each Leech will take 1 STAMINA point of blood a
round, up to a limit of 3 points each, before falling off satiat-
ed and full of blood. Pulling off a Giant Leech will cause a
further point of STAMINA damage, as its teeth tear away a
large patch of skin. Striking and killing a Leech with a small
knife needs a successful Test for Luck, or the blow will miss
and cause another point of damage. A safer way to remove a
Giant Leech is to sprinkle it with salt, which causes the
revolting creature to shrivel up and die.
