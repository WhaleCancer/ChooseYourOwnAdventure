## Description

Adults have 2 Attacks

Shy and secretive, BHORKET have only rarely been
encountered by adventurers in the eastern forests where they
dwell. These creatures are short (one and a half metres tall,
at the most) and squat, but have long, powerful arms and
legs. Bhorket look like apes, and are covered with shaggy
pelts of brown-green hair, but are more closely related to
Bears.
Bhorket are vegetarian herbivores, living on roots, berries and
flowers, and they are peaceful, nervous creatures as a result.
Because of this, and the fact that their flesh is apparently quite
succulent and tender, they have long suffered the ravages of
predators like lions and jackals. As a result, Bhorket have
developed an incredible dexterity which allows them to leap
up to ten metres with a single bound, and swing from tree to
tree at incredible speed! Such tactics help them escape most
threats.
Bhorket only mate once every four years or so, and thus are
extremely protective of the single cub that results. At such
times, a Bhorket couple will take turns at looking after the
young, one staying behind while the other patrols the vicinity,
wildly attacking any predators it encounters, to ensure the
safety of the helpless cub. A young Bhorket is usually just like
its parents; it will grow to maturity in about three years
(adding 1 SKILL and 2 STAMINA each year until adulthood).
