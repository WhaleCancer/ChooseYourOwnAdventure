## Description

In the hills of Low Xamen dwell a number of strange crea-
tures, but none more strange, perhaps, than the JIB-JIB. Shy
and secretive in the extreme, they look like a tiny ball of fur
(no bigger than a cabbage, as one wise sage put it) on two
short, stumpy legs. They have small, frightened eyes, set just
above a large mouth. Jib-Jibs are vegetarians, living on small
bushes and plants, from which they suck the juices and
nutrients, since they have neither teeth nor claws.
These timid creatures have evolved an effective defence
against the many predators that live off small, harmless
beasts like themselves. They have developed tremendously
loud voices, with which they begin to howl in an unearthly,
ear-splitting wail whenever they feel danger threatening.
The din will scare off even the largest of unintelligent crea-
tures and most more intelligent ones too, by tricking them

into thinking that they are about to be attacked by a ravening
horde of blood-crazed Demons! Only the very bravest (or
perhaps the stupidest) of creatures will ignore the horren-
dous screams and investigate further, to discover the timo-
rous little Jib-Jibs, hiding and shaking in some corner,
howling fit to raise the dead!
