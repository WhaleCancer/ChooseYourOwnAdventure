## Description

probably be called the Gigantic Leech, as it is far

larger than its smaller relatives. Indeed, some of

these creatures have mo;led green, segmented

bodies that are up to three metres in length! Found

in damp areas such as flooded forests and slimy

caverns, the Giant Forest Leech will lurk up a tree

or on a rocky ceiling, before lunging from its lair

above, a;empting to latch on to its victim with its

broad, suckered mouthparts. The first successful hit

the creatures makes on its opponent will cause

Small Bite damage; thereafter for every round of

combat the Leech is still alive, it will suck 2 points

of STAMINA from its victim, with no Armour Roll

allowed. Should it reduce its victim to 0 STAMINA, it

will abandon the body, and return to its lair,
