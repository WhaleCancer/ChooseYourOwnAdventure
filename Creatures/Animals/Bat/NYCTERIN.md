## Description

The largest species of bat that dwells upon Titan is not the Giant Bat of the southern jungles, nor is it the Cave Vampire of the deep, dark caverns. Instead it is the rare but formidable Nycterin, a bat so colossal the flapping of its wings has been likened to the closing of the shutters of the night. This creature is of tremendous size, with a wingspan approaching ten metres and an oddly formed body around two metres long.
