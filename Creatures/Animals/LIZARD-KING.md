## Description

As little as five centuries ago, what is now the great race of
Lizard Men was little more than a few disorganized tribes
who spent most of their time fighting or eating one another.
From them, though, have come the LIZARD KINGS, superi-
or reptilian beings who have taken control of the race, and
begun to organize it into a civilization. Each tribe is now
ruled over by a Lizard King, each of whom in turn pays
fealty to the members of a grand council of the wisest and
strongest beasts, in the creatures' capital in the southern
swamplands. Lizard Kings are taller and stronger than nor-
mal Lizard Men, and far more intelligent. They are civilized
and sophisticated, in their own way, and are great leaders.

Protected at all times by a guard of twenty handpicked
Lizard Man warriors, they are nevertheless superb fighters
themselves, their favourite weapons being magical fire
swords. According to custom, the Lizard King race keeps
itself as separate as it can from the lowly Lizard Men, and
interbreeding is punishable by death, to ensure that their
race is kept pure.
