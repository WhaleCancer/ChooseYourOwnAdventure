## Description

In the remote jungles of the east, apes have evolved and
adapted to their environment in many ways. In the tree
canopy many metres above the ground, the six-armed Krell
swing on the hanging vines and lianas with incredible dex-
terity. Similarly, where the jungle meets the mountains, the
HARRUN have arisen, and evolved to suit their environment.
These creatures look like small apes, except for the thin,
membrane-like wings which stretch from wrists to hips.
They have long, flattened tails which help them maintain
their balance during their short flights. A Harrun typically
launches itself from the top of a high tree, and can swoop for
up to half a kilometre down the hillside, with arms spread
wide and legs drawn up. Harrun live on fruit and small
creatures, but are particularly fond of squirrels and the like,
which they will chase across the tree-tops in death-defying
leaps and glides.
Harrun live in small family groups in the trees, and in fact
spend most of their lives above the ground. They are very
inquisitive creatures, and will soar down, chattering excited-
ly, to investigate any strangers in the forest. This may fright-
en a nervous adventurer into thinking he is being attacked
by the creatures. Despite this, Harrun have never been
known to attack anything larger than themselves, except in
defence.
