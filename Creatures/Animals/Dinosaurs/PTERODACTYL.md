## Description

Pterodactyls are large and repulsive flying Dinosaurs. They are like scrawny lizards, with a pair of leathery wings stretched out from their elongated forelegs to their ankles, giving them a wingspan approaching five metres. They are carnivores, living mostly on small animals and fish, and have become skilled at swooping down and grabbing their prey in their long jaws, before swallowing them in a single gulp. When faced with larger opponents, however, they will try to bite them, before carrying their corpses off to their nest to tear them up and eat them.
