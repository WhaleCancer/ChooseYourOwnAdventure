## Description

Iguanodon is a large plant-eating Dinosaur, up to ten meters long, with a muscular tail, stout body, and hooved feet. It typically walks on all four legs but can rear up on its hind legs for defense, using its forelimbs, which are armed with a vicious thumb-spike, against predators. Iguanodons form small herds for protection against flesh-eating Dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Dromaeosaurus.
