## Description

TRICERATOPS
    Adult       Young
 
TRICERATOPS is a close relative of Styracosaurus, though
it has only three horns on its head; one on its nose, and
two above its eyes, just before its bony neck-frill. At nine
metres long it is the largest of all the horned dinosaurs
and its thick leathery hide is impervious to most weapons.
Triceratops is a plant-eater and prefers grazing in plains
or upland areas. It is also the mortal enemy of
Tyrannosaurus, and a battle between the two is truly a
spectacle to behold. Unlike Styracosaurus, it is not
commonly used as a war-beast by the Lizard Man Empire
owing to its more aggressive and unpredictable nature.
However, if caught young, Triceratops can make for a
