## Description

Pteranodon is a large flying Dinosaur similar to Pterodactyl, though with a razor-sharp toothless beak and an elaborate crest protruding from the back of its skull. Males have a huge wingspan of up to seven metres across, while females are considerably smaller, with a three to four metre wingspan. They will build a nest atop a cliff or other high place, near the sea or a great river or lake, where they can hunt for fish. Despite this diet, Pteranodon is an extremely territorial creature, and will attack anything that enters its domain or gets close to its nesting site. Pteranodon eggs are especially valuable, as young Pteranodons imprint quickly on whoever is around when they hatch as their mother, and are thus easily trainable. Indeed, flying units of Legionaries mounted on large Pteranodons are known to be used by the Lizard Man Empire of Silur Cha in their ongoing siege against the city-state of Vymorna. Pteranodon eggs will usually fetch from a hundred to two hundred gold pieces of any major city; acquiring them however, is another matter entirely.
