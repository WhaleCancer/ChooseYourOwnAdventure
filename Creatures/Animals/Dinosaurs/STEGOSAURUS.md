## Description

One of the more peculiar-looking Dinosaurs is Stegosaurus, a four-legged armoured creature with a low belly and a mountainous back crested with an irregular row of triangular bony plates. Adults grow up to nine metres long, while the young are about half that size, and both have a long tail tipped with four sharp spikes, each of which can be up to a metre long. These tail spikes are used as a defensive weapon and Stegosaurus is very capable of flailing about with its tail against anything that threatens it (the tail weapon is known to some scholars as a thagomizer). When not disturbed, Stegosaurus is a harmless plant-eater, feeding on ferns, moss and low bushes. However there are recent rumours that some of these creatures have been pressed into service as war-beasts by the Lizard Men of Silur Cha. While not as numerous as the Lizard Man Empire's other Dinosaur battalions, cohorts of armoured Stegosaurus, each ridden by a sling-wielding Legionary, have apparently seen service at the Siege of Vymorna.
