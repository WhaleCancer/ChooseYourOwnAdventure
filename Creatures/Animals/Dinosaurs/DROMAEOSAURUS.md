## Description

DROMAEOSAURUS
     Adult      Young
 
Not all Dinosaurs are gigantic; some, such as
DROMAEOSAURUS, are relatively small. These are
bipedal carnivorous Dinosaurs growing anywhere from
two to four metres long; combat scores are given above
for both adult and young creatures. They are armed with
grasping claws on their forelimbs and a fang-filled mouth,
but their main weapons are giant curved killing talons,
one of which is found on each foot. These are used to
40       DIADRONE

disembowel their prey, which includes small mammals,
as well as larger Dinosaurs, as Dromaeosaurus is a
renowned pack-hunter, capable of working together to
bring down prey far larger than itself. They are also bred
by the Lizard Men of Silur Cha and used as fast riding
steeds, usually carrying a lightly armoured Legionary
wielding a javelin or cavalry spear. On the borders of the
Lizard Man Empire, such as the Axehead Plains, they are
called Running Lizards, and both they and their riders are
greatly feared by the small human settlements such as
Capra and Coppertown.
