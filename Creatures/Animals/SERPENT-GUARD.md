## Description

In their labyrinthine stone cities hidden deep in the far south-
ern reaches of the Desert of Skulls, the Caarth are ruled over
by demonic sorcerers. Forever searching for ways of extend-
ing the powers of their snake forefathers, and in worship of
their most beloved Sith, they have tried to merge humanoids
with snakes in many ways. SERPENT GUARDS are thought
to be the result of one of their more successful experiments.
They are disconcerting beings, with their humanoid upper
torso perched above a huge snake's body and tail. Their
heads are distinctly snake-like too, with large eyes and wide
fang-filled mouths. They are covered with reptilian scales,
though their upper quarters are more usually hidden under
layers of armour. Serpent Guards are intelligent enough to
be given complex orders by their evil masters, usually being
assigned to patrol the outer defences of their cities or lands.
They will always be carrying an array of weapons, for they
are highly skilled in the use of sword, battle-axe and spear,
and will prove to be deadly adversaries.
