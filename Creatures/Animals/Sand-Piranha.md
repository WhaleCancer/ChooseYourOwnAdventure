## Description

Sometimes the most fearsome inhabitants of the

wastelands of central Khul are not necessarily the

biggest or the most powerful. For example, the

dreaded SAND PIRANHA is only a forearm in

length, yet because it a;acks in such numbers, a

normal-sized school of the creatures are capable of

stripping flesh from bone in mere seconds. Unlike

its namesake, the Sand Piranha is actually a reptile

and not a fish, looking like a small thickset lizard,

with orange-red scales and a mouth full of large

blade-like white teeth. They hunt their prey in large

groups, swimming through the sandy dunes like

fish glide through water. Sand Piranhas are always

hungry and not picky about their food, a;acking

anything up to a Gunderwal in size. They are thus

greatly feared throughout their range, from the

Northern Wastes near Kalagar to the Scythera

Desert in the far south. In combat, a shoal of Sand

Piranhas can be treated as having a single SKILL
