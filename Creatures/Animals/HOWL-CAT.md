## Description

When first discovered, HOWL CATS were mistaken for a
variety of feline. Indeed, on first sighting, it is not difficult to
imagine how this mistake was made. But they were subse-
quently discovered to be members of the Ape family, even
though their heads are more characteristic of a lion than of
an ape. They are short-haired apes, about the size of a large
dog, and inhabit the timber-line between forests and higher
mountainous areas, mainly in the western reaches of Kakha-
bad. Their bodies are a mottled grey colour, but their heads
are ringed with a bold, ruddy mane (hence their resemblance
to a lion).
Howl Cats are carnivorous. Though they attack in turn, one
after the other, a second creature is rarely needed in a battle.
Their jaws are lined with razor-sharp teeth and each hand, or
paw, wields a single slashing claw. They take their name
from their battle-cry, an ear-piercing shriek which cannot fail
to strike terror in the hearts of their opponents. This cry is
always a prelude to their launching into attack, and, for the
Attack Round following this howl, anyone fighting a Howl

Cat must deduct 1 point from their Attack Strength. During
a battle, a Howl Cat will voice its cry whenever it takes
STAMINA damage, and its opponent must suffer the Attack
Strength penalty for the next Attack Round. But each time it
utters its scream, this drains 1 STAMINA point from the
creature.
