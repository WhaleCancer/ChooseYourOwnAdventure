## Description

The RHINO-MEN of the southern plains are thought to be
the sorry remnants of evil experiments by a mad sorcerer
many centuries ago. They are huge, bulky humanoids,
resembling a cross between a rhinoceros and a human. Their
heads are large, with a huge horn of matted hair projecting
from their foreheads. Their skin hangs in thick folds, and is
tougher than leather armour. If encountered in the wild (a
fairly rare occurrence, as they are not a common species), they
will usually be on the trail of game, and carrying crude spears
and knives. Some Rhino-Men, however, may be found
serving as guards and soldiers for an evil leader, in which
case they will be carrying better weapons and may be wearing
the livery of their master. They don't make particularly good
soldiers, for they are surly and clumsy, but their strength
serves them in good stead in a fight.
