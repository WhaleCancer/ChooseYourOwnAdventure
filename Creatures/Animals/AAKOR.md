## Description

AAKOR were perhaps once ordinary Wolves, before they
gained their wings and their penchant for warm blood. It is
more likely, though, that they are the remnants of some
sorcerous experiment by a forgotten wizard centuries ago.
They are strange creatures, smaller than Wolves, but
physically very similar, except for a large pair of feathery
wings sprouting from their shoulders. They can fly well,
steering themselves with their bushy tails as their keen eyes
seek out suitable food below them. They hunt in packs,
soaring high in the sky on outstretched wings and howling
in the moonlight. They usually live on deer or boar, but they
don't restrict their diet to four-legged creatures. They can
prove dangerous foes, as they swoop down on travellers,
claws outstretched to grab their next meal. They will take one
particular target each, land on their prey and bite deeply.
Once their prey has been finished off, they will pause to lap
up the still-warm blood before tearing them apart and eating
them.
