## Description

GIANT TOADS may be found in many places, from the
depths of the moist southern jungles to a chill pool far be-
neath the ground. Unlike Spit Toads, they do not need con-
stant contact with water, but their surroundings must be
fairly moist or their skin will dry and crack. They are repul-
sive, warty beasts, about one and a half metres high when
crouched on all fours, typically coloured with mottled patch-
es of yellow, green and brown. Their powerful hind legs
allow them to hop up to ten metres at a single bound, which
can often surprise an opponent. For even greater reach, the
things have an extendable tongue, up to four metres long,
with which they will attack. Because of the size and strength
of much of its prey, however, a Giant Toad will first disable
or kill, before attempting to swallow a victim. At the end of
its sticky tongue there is a poison gland which means that the
Toad's blows will do 4 points of damage to a person's STAM-
INA after a successful hit has been rolled. Once its prey is
dead, the Toad will reel it in on its tongue and swallow it
whole before moving on in search of more food.
