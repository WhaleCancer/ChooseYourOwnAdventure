## Description

The FERROVORE is a truly bizarre creature, a giant

subterranean amphibian that does not feast on flesh

or insects but instead consumes iron and other

metals. It resembles a massive toad, with thick,

pi;ed skin the colour and texture of rusting metal.

The Ferrovore’s expansive mouth is studded with

diamond-hard shark-like teeth that it uses to grind

its food into digestible chunks.

It waddles about

underground on four claw-tipped legs, sniffing out

all kinds of metals. Ferrovores prefer to eat iron, tin

and copper in roughly that order, but will subsist

on silver and gold if there are no more favourable

metals available. As soon as it has detected metal,

the Ferrovore will u;er a series of strange croaking

growls and spring forward with startling speed,

determined to feast!

Each successful a;ack a Ferrovore makes will cause

normal damage and destroy one large metal object
