## Description

Even in the most placid and idyllic pools dangerous crea-
tures may lurk just below the surface. The SPIT TOAD is one
such peril, a man-sized amphibian that attacks by shooting a
jet of acid at any creature stopping to drink at its pool. Unless
the target rolls under his SKILL score (on two dice), he will
be blinded by the liquid, leaving him vulnerable to the Spit
Toad as it leaps out of the water and attacks with a mouth
full of teeth. If its opponent has been blinded, it will automat-
ically bite him in its first strike, causing 2 points of STAMI-
NA damage; otherwise, the fight will proceed as normal.
Should the Spit Toad kill its opponent, it will swallow him
whole, before leaping back into its pool. Spit Toads are
solitary creatures, and only meet up on one night a year, to

mate and spawn in the moonlight before returning to the
safety of their lonely pools, to wait for their next meal.
