## Description

The size and fearlessness of SKUNKBEARS make them ex-
ceedingly dangerous. They are almost three metres tall when
they rear up on their hind legs to attack, and are covered in
shaggy black and white fur with long bushy tails. They
typically make their homes in caves or hollow trees, but
during the daylight hours they will roam over a wide area in
search of food. They are found almost exclusively in the wild
mountainous areas of Kakhabad.
Skunkbears eat most living things, typically deer and boar.
Their huge claw-tipped paws are normally sufficient to cope
with most creatures. If they feel threatened, however, they
will use another method of attack. Turning its back on its
opponent, a Skunkbear will lift its tail and squirt a nauseat-
ing secretion from a special gland. This smells so foul that its
opponent will be forced to fight with 2 points temporarily
removed from his SKILL as he gags on the stench. This smell
also permeates the glossy pelt of the Skunkbear, unfortu-
nately making it worthless.
