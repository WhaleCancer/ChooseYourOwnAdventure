Possibly related to the Phoenix, the more powerful CELASTRIX is a near-mythical bird of divine origin, the legendary messenger of the gods. Also known as the "Bird of Light," it resembles a gigantic eagle with a crest of glowing golden feathers. The Celastrix is a powerful flyer with huge talons and an aura of goodness that surrounds it.

The Celastrix is friendly towards good beings and may grant a golden feather that can be used for aid. It has served as a messenger of the gods throughout history, though it is extremely rare in modern times. The last known Celastrix was captured by the Dark Tyrant's Chaos Beast Men allies.
