## Description

Whether it is the descendant of a long-dead Dinosaur, or a Giant Lizard that has learnt to walk upright, the Pit Fiend is a frightening creature. Standing close on ten metres high on two enormous clawed legs, it is covered in a tough leathery hide mottled with blotches of green and brown. Its head is large, with powerful jaws designed solely for snapping bones and rending flesh, for the beast is utterly carnivorous. Its name comes from its use in games, where gladiators chosen from condemned prisoners are sent into a huge pit to fight one of the brutes, much to the delight of a bloodthirsty audience.
