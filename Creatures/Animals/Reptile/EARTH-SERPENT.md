## Description

The Earth Serpent was made to mimic the powers of Throff, the Earth Goddess. It is a huge serpent with burnished dark brown scales, thick coils, and broad copper-coloured wings. It attacks using earth powers: exploding rocks, collapsing pits, erupting red-hot glowstones, and rolling boulders. Each earth attack deals 1 to 6 STAMINA damage and requires a successful Test for Skill to avoid. If foes survive the earth attacks, it attacks with its fang-filled mouth. The Earth Serpent only takes half STAMINA damage from direct magical attacks like the Force Bolt spell.

## Weakness

The Earth Serpent needs to be in contact with the ground to use its powers. If raised off the ground, it transforms into a small green snake that can be easily destroyed. It can be destroyed by magic spells such as Levitate, Fly, or HUF (if the caster has a Galehorn). Alternatively, one can grapple with it bare-handed and lift it from the earth. This requires winning an Attack Round (or taking an automatic hit), then a successful Test for Skill (or using the Strength Special Skill). Failure means trying again in the next Attack Round. If commanded by the Serpent Ring to reveal Mampang Fortress secrets, it counsels offering no gold to Valignya if one values their life.
