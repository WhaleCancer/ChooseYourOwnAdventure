## Description

The Air Serpent was made in tribute to Pangara, God of Wind. It resembles a cloudy jet of gas in the form of a great winged serpent. It attacks by smothering victims with choking gasses: the first successful attack causes 1 STAMINA damage, the second causes 2 STAMINA damage, the third causes 4 STAMINA damage, doubling with each subsequent hit.

If a victim is slain, the Air Serpent can blow into the corpse's lungs, animating it like a Zombie. When fought in gaseous form, it is difficult to defeat: a die roll of 1-3 causes no damage, while 4-6 inflicts 1 less STAMINA damage than normal. The Air Serpent is immune to lightning and fire-based attacks.

## Weakness

When gaseous, the Air Serpent leaves behind a shrivelled green snakeskin among the corpse's possessions. Tearing this skin to pieces instantly destroys the serpent. It can also be blown apart by a HUF Spell if the caster has the Galehorn. If commanded by the Serpent Ring to reveal Mampang Fortress secrets, it advises against lighting one's way with a Blood Candle in the Chamber of Night. It is known as the slayer of Tek Kramin, the boatman of Lake Ilklala, and is despised by lakeside residents.
