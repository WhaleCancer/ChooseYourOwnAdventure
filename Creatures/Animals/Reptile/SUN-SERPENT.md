## Description

The Sun Serpent was fashioned after Glantanka, Goddess of the Sun. It appears as a great golden-scaled winged serpent with a spike-crested head. The Sun Serpent can shoot bolts of flame from its eyes every other Attack Round; these hit on a roll of 1-4 on one die and cause one die worth of STAMINA damage.

It is immune to lightning and fire-based attacks. Its weakness is that it detests water and is utterly destroyed if a water-bottle is thrown at it (requires a successful Test for Skill). If slain, it shrivels away, leaving a glowing Sun Jewel.

When commanded by the Serpent Ring, it advises to beware the breath of the Mucalytics. Rumor states it was lured by a Rain Spell from the Black Elf sorceress Fenestra in the Baklands and imprisoned in a Glass Orb, to be used as bait in her feud with the Water Serpent.
