## Description

The Water Serpent is an imitation of Hydana the Sea God or Aqualis, God of Rivers. It is a huge serpent made of water with liquid wings and a fish-like maw. The Water Serpent is immune to lightning and fire-based attacks.

## Weakness

The Water Serpent cannot abide oil and is destroyed if oil is thrown at it (requiring a successful Test for Skill). When commanded by the Serpent Ring to reveal Mampang Fortress secrets, it advises paying respects to Naggamanteh the Torture Master. It is known to have slain Fenestra's father, leading to Fenestra's quest for vengeance and her stocking up on flasks of oil.
