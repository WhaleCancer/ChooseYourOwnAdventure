## Description

Swamp Mutants are horrible monsters found in the Swamplands of Silur Cha. Some are native, while others are recent arrivals, mutated by noxious effluence from the Lizard Men Empire's cities and temples. They are highly carnivorous, around ten meters long, with a crocodilian body and a mutated alligator-like head. They are sickly white and can rear up on hind legs to attack, using clawed forearms and a toothy maw to rip prey. They are found across Silur Cha, up to the River Vymorn and Nightshriek Jungles. There are rumors that Lizard Men are taming and training young Swamp Mutants for their navy.
