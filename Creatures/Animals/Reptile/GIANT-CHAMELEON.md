## Description

Giant Chameleons dwell only in the deepest, darkest jungles and forests, using their colour-changing skin to blend in with the foliage, waiting patiently for their prey to wander past. Then, they seem to melt out of the greenery and attack, almost always with the element of surprise. A Giant Chameleon looks like a scaled-up version of its smaller lizard namesake, with a long prehensile tail, opposing claws on all feet, and a blunt, snub-nosed head dominated by a gaping tooth-lined mouth and bizarre turret-like eyes that rotate independently to scan its surroundings. Once they have attacked, their scaly skin often takes on a variety of brightly-coloured hues – a sure sign it is angry!

If the Giant Chameleon ever gets 20 or 21 for its Attack Strength and wins the Attack Round, then, with a horrible squelching sound, its tongue (which is as long as its body) shoots out of its mouth and hits its prey with a sticky pad at its tip. This holds the prey fast while the creature retracts its tongue, drawing the victim into the Giant Chameleon's mouth where it can be bitten severely for the loss of 4 STAMINA and 1 SKILL.

These enormous lizards are often used by Chameleonites as steeds, such as those who dwell within the jungles of Bone Island. In other lands, Wood Elves and Jungle Elves hunt them for their skins, which, if fashioned correctly, will enable a skilled enchanter to create a Chameleon Cloak. This wondrous artefact allows its wearer to blend in with the background, and is much sought after by thieves and rogues as a result.
