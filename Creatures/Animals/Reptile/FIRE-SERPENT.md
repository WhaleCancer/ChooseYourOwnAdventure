## Description

The Fire Serpent was inspired by Filash, God of Fire. It is a great serpent with scarlet scales and winged pinions of pure flame. It initially appears as a small reddish-yellow snake to lure enemies, then erupts in a lethal firestorm. Anyone caught in the blast must roll a die: on a 1-4, they suffer STAMINA damage; on a 5-6, their eyes are burnt, causing them to lose 3 STAMINA and 1 SKILL point. It attacks with its fang-filled mouth, and combatants must Test for Luck each round or lose 1-3 additional STAMINA as it self-immolates. The Fire Serpent is completely immune to any fire-based attacks.

## Weakness

The Fire Serpent's fire is rendered inert by sand, causing it to revert to its snake form. It is also susceptible to strong magical wind, which prevents fire damage and reduces its SKILL by 2 (for example, a HUF spell with a Galehorn).
