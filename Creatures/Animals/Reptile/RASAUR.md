## Description

The Rasaur is a rare type of carnivorous reptile from south-western Allansia. Here it is found in the rocky Uron Heights on the southern border of the Desert of Skulls, throughout the dunes of the desert itself, and the hills and plains of Arantis as well. The name Rasaur means "Lizard of the Sun Goddess" in ancient Djaratian, as Ra is believed to be another name for Assamura, Goddess of the Sun. They are occasionally used as temple guardians by priestesses of Assamura, hence the name.

The Rasaur is a large reptilian creature with a dragon-like head and a fang-filled mouth. It has a long black tongue that snakes out from between its jaws. The Rasaur has six crocodile-like legs that enable it to run at high speed. Its body and tail resemble that of a large lizard, and it is covered in scales that shimmer in the sunlight.

## Special Abilities

**Poison Tongue:** The Rasaur's long black tongue is coated in a deadly poison. If it successfully hits with its tongue attack, the victim must make a Test for Luck or suffer additional STAMINA damage.
