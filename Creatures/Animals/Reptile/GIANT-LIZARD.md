## Description

Six metres long and one and a half metres high, ferocious Giant Lizards can be major hazards to adventurers in many parts of Allansia and northern Kakhabad. Huge versions of their smaller cousins, they roam far and wide in search of fresh meat. The creatures appear slow, as they lumber along on four ungainly feet and drag their cumbersome tails behind them, but in a fight they prove to be remarkably agile, darting beneath swords to deliver savage bites from their large fang-filled mouths.

Giant Lizards are solitary, aggressive reptiles as a rule, but they will meet up once a year to mate, producing a clutch of one to three eggs, before parting again. Young Giant Lizards will hatch out in twelve weeks or so. If trained from birth, Giant Lizards can be made to carry a rider, and as a result their eggs fetch a high price. It is believed that both the Lizard Men of Fire Island and the Caarth of the southern deserts maintain large troops of cavalry mounted on Giant Lizards.
