## Description

Tribes of BIRD MEN are found in mountainous areas across
the whole of Allansia and Kakhabad, perched in villages and
caves in the highest peaks.

They are short and sinewy, with especially powerful chest
muscles, which support a wide pair of feathered wings. Their
mouths are sharp, hooked beaks, and both arms and legs end
in cutting talons. They are covered in short, almost feathery
hair, which varies in colour from green through brown to grey
and black, according to their tribe. Bird Men talk in strange
chirruping voices that can change into disconcerting piercing
shrieks as they wheel down out of the sky to attack their foes.
The tribes of the Moonstone Hills in northern Allansia are
quite primitive for their race. Attracted by metal objects,
which they consider great status symbols, they will attack
lone adventurers in great numbers. They are rather cowardly
creatures, though, and a display of strength by their victim
can often drive them off in search of easier prey!
The Bird Men of northern Kakhabad's Zanzunu Peaks are
more civilized, and dwell in large labyrinthine towns carved
into the sides of the impassable peaks. The rise in power of
the Archmage in Mampang split the tribes, and civil war rages
between them even now. Some sided with the sorcerer and
became his troops, even stealing the legendary Crown of
Kings from Analand for their evil new master. Others,
however, declined to serve the magician, and now hide in
well-defended settlements, mounting raids on the other tribes
in planned guerilla actions. They can use crude spears and
swords, and even fly in tight aerial formation.
They have been known to help adventurers by providing
information or a lift over the inhospitable terrain, in return
for news from the outlands or aid in the war against their
enemies. If crossed by an ally of the evil Bird Men, however,
their response will be swift and merciless. Their favourite
punishment is to grab their prey by the limbs, climb high into
the sky and then allow it to drop to its death on the rocks
below.
