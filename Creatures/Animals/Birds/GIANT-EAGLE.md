## Description

Giant Eagles are only ever found in the most desolate places, well away from humans who would hunt and kill them, and steal their eggs and young to tame. They stand as tall as a man, with a wingspan approaching eight metres when fully outstretched, and their talons are like curved daggers. They live on any creatures they can catch, and are not averse to attacking humans. Like their smaller cousins, they will initially attack in a powerful dive. If a Giant Eagle scores two hits in succession, it will grasp its prey in its talons and fly off back to its huge nest high in the mountains, with a tasty morsel for its young.
