## Description

GIANT OWLS are rare creatures, because they avoid
harassment by inhabiting very remote areas. In the past, many
princes and lords kept the birds for hunting and as status
symbols, and as a result few are now left in the wild. These
magnificent birds stand up to one and a half metres tall, with
a wingspan of almost double that. Like their smaller cousins,
they are usually nocturnal, emerging at sundown to hunt for
food in the twilight. Giant Owls usually feed upon sheep and
goats, preferring herd animals to humanoids who might fight
back.
These birds make their homes at the tops of large trees, and
occasionally in ruined towers and the like. Their nests are like
those of any bird, built from twigs and branches, woven
together and lined with feathers and down. A pair of Giant
Owls will produce a clutch of one or two eggs only once a
year. Their eggs and chicks fetch exorbitant prices from
noblemen, as the young can with care be trained like hawks,
some even to be ridden! The parents tend to be wary to the
point of aggressiveness, if they feel that their brood is being
threatened. Giant Owls attack in high-speed dives which add
4 to their SKILL for their first attack. Their talons are cruelly
sharp, and can easily slice through helmets and shields.
