## Description

The Phororhacos is a huge, meat-eating, flightless bird, taller than a man, with a powerful blade-like beak and muscular legs that end in curved talons. It has a feathery crest and tiny wings used for balance. It preys on deer and small antelope. Its habitat is isolated parts of Khul, including the foothills of the Mountains of the Giants and the marginal steppes that form the Battlegrounds near Corda.

Amazons of northern Khul raise the Phororhacos from hatchlings to become formidable battle-steeds, and they are intelligent enough to understand commands. Phororhacos eggs are valuable (over 100 Gold Pieces) but the birds defend their nests fiercely.
