## Description

Giant Stormbirds are avian creatures related to albatrosses and petrels, with a wingspan of six to eight metres, a broad yellow beak, and yellow-tipped black talons. They take residence on isolated sea-stacks or cliff-top eyries, building nests of dry kelp and driftwood. Their nests contain 1-3 eggs that hatch into flightless chicks. They primarily feed on large fish and smaller seabirds' eggs and chicks, but are known to attack ships and boats, attempting to carry off sailors.
