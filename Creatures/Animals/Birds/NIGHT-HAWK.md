## Description

There are times when a message must be sent more quickly than a horse can ride or into a normally inaccessible area. For these reasons many people keep Hawks, especially trained to carry messages tied to their legs and to fight off any attackers.

The large Night Hawks are more clever, and are able to fly and attack in formation. When a line of the large black birds begins to dive out of the sky, one after the other in perfect order, only the bravest of opponents will stand his ground! These creatures are the favourite pets of a number of evil men, for they make superb guards, since they are able to patrol a wide area of land much more easily than a foot patrol, and with their keen eyes pick out intruders from as much as a kilometre away before swooping down to attack.
