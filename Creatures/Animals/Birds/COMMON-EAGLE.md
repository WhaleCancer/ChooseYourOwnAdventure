## Description

Eagles may be encountered in rocky, mountainous areas across the whole of Allansia and beyond, where they make their nests at the top of high trees or perched on sheer cliffs. They are predatory birds, living on rabbits, fish, rats and other small creatures, though stories abound of Eagles taking sheep and even children. Usually they will not attack humans unless they appear to be threatening the Eagle's nest or chicks. Their first attack will be a great swooping dive, which will add 3 points to their SKILL as they come screeching down, talons outstretched. After this first swoop their SKILL will revert to normal.

Eagles are fairly difficult to train, even for hunting, for they are the wildest of all the birds of prey. Nevertheless, their eggs may fetch as much as 200 Gold Pieces each from a nobleman or bird-trainer.
