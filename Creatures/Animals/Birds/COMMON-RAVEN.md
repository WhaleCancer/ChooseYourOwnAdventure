## Description

Ravens are large, black-feathered birds, related to crows and jackdaws but with thick heavy beaks that are blade-like in shape.

The Common Raven is found across Titan, in small flocks, or, to use the technical term 'An Unkindness of Ravens'. They will attack as a group to defend a food source such as a rotting carcass, so for every extra Raven add 1 SKILL, 2 STAMINA and 1 ATTACK to the scores listed above. They are considered birds of ill-omen, particularly at funerals where superstition holds that they will fly away with the soul of the dead person, denying it its final resting place. Conversely, they are also admired for their imposing appearance and obsidian-coloured beak and claws, and many a knight or warlord, such as Lord Varen of Ruddlestone, has used the Raven as a symbol on their shield or armour. They are also used as familiars by witches and hedge-wizards, where their intelligence and flying ability make them especially useful.
