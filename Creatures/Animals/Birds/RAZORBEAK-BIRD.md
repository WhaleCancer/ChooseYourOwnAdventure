## Description

The Razorbeak Bird is a type of carnivorous avian found throughout Titan, though it is thankfully rare. They are not especially big birds, perhaps being around the size of a large hawk, with black wings and a white-feathered body. However, they are so-named for their dagger-like bills, which are long, cruelly pointed, and razor-sharp. The birds use these beaks for both killing their prey and noisily tearing it apart to eat, usually in such a manner that scatters blood and gore everywhere! They are impossible to escape from because they are such fast fliers.
