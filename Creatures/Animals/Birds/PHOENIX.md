## Description

The Phoenix is a near-mythical bird that hails from the Magical Plane of Fire but is sometimes found haunting isolated corners of Titan, such as desert rock-spires or lonely mountain peaks. It is a magnificent creature, larger than most eagles, with red glowing eyes and a long, curved beak that utters a harsh, ear-splitting cry. The fine plumage of the Phoenix is comprised of metallic-looking feathers that are gold in colour, and its strangest feature is a halo of yellow flame that plays lightly all over its body without consuming it.

The Phoenix will make an initial warning attack against those that disturb it, swooping close and exploding in flame that causes 2 STAMINA points of damage to its opponent. If this fails to deter its enemies, it will attack, immolating itself every round which bathes its victims in flames that cause zero to five STAMINA points of damage (roll one die and minus 1) per round.

This ability to both tolerate and use fire in such spectacular fashion has seen the Phoenix worshipped as a symbol of reincarnation for being both born and consumed by flames, as well as carrying lost souls back to the lands of the living. The Healer of the Moonstone Hills, for example, has taken the Phoenix as his totem symbol, and a stylized rock carving of the bird marks the entrance to his cave in the Allansian highlands. Further south, in the ruined city of Vatos, disciples of Priestess Leesha wear headdresses in the shape of the Phoenix and venerate tapestries depicting the fabulous bird rising from the ashes. Across the sea, in Khul, possession of a sparkling red ruby carved into the shape of a Phoenix will allow the bearer to extract one favour from any Phoenix he encounters.

## Special Abilities
