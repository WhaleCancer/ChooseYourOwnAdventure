## Description

The Pterolin is a large condor-like bird of the rugged uplands of north-eastern Khul, thought to be related to Grypvultures and their scavenging ilk. They are spectacular raptors, with feathers as black as night that glow with a blue sheen in the sun, and a bright red bare-skinned head. Unlike vultures and other carrion birds, Pterolins are active hunters, and are always hungry for more food, no matter if their talons are still dripping with gore from a recent kill. With their four-metre wingspan they will patrol the skies, attacking nearly anything that enters their territory. If two Pterolins are encountered, they will be a mated pair, and the second bird will be a female.
