## Description

Ravens are large, black-feathered birds, related to crows and jackdaws but with thick heavy beaks that are blade-like in shape.

Giant Ravens are huge birds, with wingspans up to two metres, and found on the plains of Lendleland and Analand, as well as the foothills of Mauristatia. Here they can be seen soaring through the sky, searching out carrion or other food to feast upon. Giant Ravens are dangerous and wily enemies, always attempting to strike an opponent's face and peck out their eyes. If a victim is wounded at least once by the bird in combat they must Test for Skill. If they are unsuccessful, the Giant Raven has pecked out one of their eyes and they must immediately lose 2 SKILL points; this also inflicts the Curse of the Raven (see Heroes Companion, p. 74). They are intelligent birds and can be trained relatively easily, so for this reason the eggs and young of Giant Ravens will sell for fifty to one hundred Gold Pieces in the market-place of any large city.
