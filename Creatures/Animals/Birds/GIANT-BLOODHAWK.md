## Description

The Giant Bloodhawk is the largest hawk species on Titan, with a wingspan exceeding four metres and flame-red feathers that lighten on its head and breast. It is an impressive aerial raptor found over grasslands, known for its sharp eyesight and attacking with razor-sharp talons. Giant Bloodhawks are intelligent creatures, knowledgeable about their territories. They will patiently wait for prey that disappears (e.g., through invisibility) to reappear before striking again, making them desirable for kings. They are capable of bargaining for freedom with promises of treasure, but beware that these promises might lead to a Blog ambush.
