## Description

Goldcrest Eagles are found only in the hills of Analand in southern Kakhabad. They are larger than most Eagles, with a wingspan of well over three metres, and have a brilliant patch of gold on their heads which gives them their name. Unlike most species, they have been extensively trained for many centuries by the people of Analand, and are now reared in captivity. They are sometimes used for fighting and hunting, but they are most effective as messengers, carrying urgent news and orders as fast as the wind, and hidden from the eyes of enemies under a cloak of invisibility. For Goldcrest Eagles need only concentrate and they will disappear, to fly on their mission in safety. If they ever need to fight, however, they will lose their concentration and become visible, but the huge birds have been trained well and they are skilful fighters.
