## Description

There are times when a message must be sent more quickly than a horse can ride or into a normally inaccessible area. For these reasons many people keep Hawks, especially trained to carry messages tied to their legs and to fight off any attackers.

Death Hawks, so called because in primitive times they were thought to be the message-carriers of the Gods themselves, are jet-black in colour with reddened eyes and large talons. With a wingspan approaching a metre across, they are not small birds, though they are sometimes mistaken for crows or ravens when seen from a distance. They are not very clever, about as smart as homing-pigeons, but they are plucky fighters.
