## Description

Giant Rats are a menace to all those who would search for treasure in ancient ruins or tombs. They are just like normal rats, but much larger – about a metre long, with sharp claws and teeth that can gnaw through plate armour. They tend to hunt in small packs, of which one Giant Rat will usually be the leader. Larger and stronger than the others (add 1 point to both SKILL and STAMINA), it will appear to be giving orders to them via a complicated language of squeaks. If the leader is killed – a difficult task since it will try to remain at the rear in any fight – the other Giant Rats will retreat in disorganized panic, allowing their opponents to escape safely.
