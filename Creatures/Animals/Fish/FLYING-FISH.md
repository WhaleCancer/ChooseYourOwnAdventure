## Description

There are FLYING FISH in the warm southern oceans, but
none are as dangerous or aggressive as those found in Lake
Ilklala in Kakhabad. They are only as long as a man's hand,
but their wide mouths brim with teeth which can tear
through flesh and bone alike. They can fly for a few minutes
at a time, flapping thin, oversized fins like wings. Their long,
feathery tails enable them to turn and swoop quite aerobati-
cally, and they can bite while flying. The Flying Fish will
attack as a group (treated as a single creature), flapping
around their opponent for a maximum of seven Attack
Rounds before they must land in the water again. If they land
on the ground, they will quickly die, weakly flapping in a
vain attempt to reach the lake and safety.
Should anyone be foolish enough to eat one, they will find
that its meat tastes foul and causes intense stomach pains for
several hours, for one die of STAMINA damage.
