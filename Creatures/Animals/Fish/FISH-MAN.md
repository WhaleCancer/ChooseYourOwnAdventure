## Description

Originally the result of some grisly experiments by an evil
sorcerer in the Cloudcap Mountains, FISH MEN are strange
hybrids between men and fish. They have spindly legs,
which support a wide torso. Their heads are fish-like, with
huge bulbous eyes and a broad mouth, joining straight on to
their bodies without a neck. They are covered completely
with small yellow-green scales which drip with water and
slime.
The strange creatures have both a fish's gills and a human's
lungs, and can thus breathe both air and water. Their scaly
nature, however, requires them to keep themselves damp;
should they dry out, their skins would crack and they would
die. For this reason they will only ever be encountered in or
near a large body of water, often a pool inside a shady cave,
well away from the sun. Fish Men are solitary beings, full of
hatred for the world that shuns them as freaks. However,
once a year, at the time of the Spring Equinox, they will
gather in an ancient lake in the mountains to spawn, croak-
ing and gurgling at the moon in their husky voices.
Fish Men are not very intelligent, though they have learnt to
use spears and javelins stolen from past opponents. They are
prodigious meat-eaters, always hungry, and will attack most
creatures. They are attracted, almost like magpies, to bright
sparkling items, with which they will sometimes decorate
the floor of their pool – laying coins, gems and other trinkets
in a bizarre underwater mosaic!
