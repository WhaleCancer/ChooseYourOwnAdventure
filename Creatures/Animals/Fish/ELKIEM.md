## Description

The Elkiem is a solitary aquatic hunter with blue-green scaly skin, webbed, claw-tipped hands and feet, a human-like head with glaring yellow eyes, a wide mouth full of sharp teeth, bony ridges down its back, and slit-like nostrils and neck-gills for breathing both on land and in water.

The Elkiem uses an abandoned fishing pole as a trap. Victims must pass a Skill Test or be ensnared, then pulled into the water where they fight with an -8 penalty and risk drowning on a double 1 Attack Strength roll.

The "Deep Red Pool of Elkiem" in the Caves of Minosaddurr is reputedly crawling with these creatures, where the scarlet waters hide their deadly traps.
