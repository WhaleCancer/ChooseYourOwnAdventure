## Description

Swordfish are bizarre, blade-wielding piscine humanoids, not to be confused with the actual fish. They are man-like creatures with fish heads, dressed in fine clothes including plumed hats and knee-high boots. They carry razor-sharp rapiers and flasks of healing potion (restoring 2 STAMINA or to 10).

They are often found alone in shipwrecks or sunken cities, acting as sword-masters, but can also live in tidal areas and tolerate short periods out of water. Small communities with children exist in coral reefs. They are secretive and often kidnapped by warlike races like Sea Trolls to serve as mercenaries against Merfolk and Sea Elves.

Famous Swordfish include Cyrano (finest swordsman, dwells in a ruined cathedral in Atlantis) and Merkurio (roving ambassador, dwelt in the Croaking Caves of Daddu-Yadu). Their origins are unknown, with speculation ranging from being related to Fish Men or Elkiem, to being men from Femphrey cursed by a Sea Hag.
