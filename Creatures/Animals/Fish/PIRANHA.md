## Description

Piranhas are found in the rivers and lakes of the hot southern jungles, where they are greatly feared. They are voracious feeders, and can strip a horse to the bone with their teeth in a few minutes! Each fish is between twenty and thirty centimetres long, but they always swim and feed in a pack. The first sign most swimmers have of their presence is a turbulence in the water, as though it were boiling and bubbling, before they are jostled and buffeted as the Piranhas fight one another to be the first to feed. The pack can be treated as having a single SKILL, with each fish having a STAMINA of 1. There are few tactics one can use against Piranhas: having a piece of fresh meat to distract them is useful, but few swimmers will be carrying such a thing!
