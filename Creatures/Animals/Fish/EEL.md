## Description

All EELS are long and extremely thin in proportion to their
length; they may be found in a variety of places from open
sea to swamp. Most are harmless, but a few species can
prove dangerous to an adventurer.
BLOOD EELS grow up to a metre long, and live in fresh
water. They are savage predators, occasionally even attack-
ing and killing pike, with which they have a great rivalry for
prey. They have also been known to attack humans wading
or swimming in their river. They will glide silently up to
their prey and bite with needle-like teeth, automatically
doing 2 points of damage. After their first attack they can be
fought normally, but their opponent will have his SKILL
temporarily reduced by 2 points for trying to fight in the
water.
ELECTRIC EELS are only found in warm coastal waters.
They are fairly small, and rarely grow to more than half a
metre long. They have developed the ability to emit a strong
burst of electricity, which is usually enough to stun or kill the
small fish they live on. The charge can be emitted only twice
a day before it is depleted, each burst doing 4 points of
damage. They can also attack normally, though if their elec-
tricity is not enough to kill potential prey, they may decide
to leave it well alone!
Most dangerous of all are GIANT EELS, as they can grow up
to eight metres long and thirty centimetres thick. They are
very strong and well equipped for hunting – their teeth are
like small daggers – and are capable of catching and killing
crocodiles and other large creatures. If an adventurer is
attacked by a Giant Eel in water more than a metre deep, he
must defeat the monster in less Attack Rounds than his
current SKILL score or he will be entangled in its crushing
coils and drowned.
