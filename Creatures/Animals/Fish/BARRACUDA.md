## Description

Barracudas are fearsome snaggle-toothed silvery fish, up to two metres long, with slender, fine-scaled, arrow-like bodies, madly staring eyes, and long jaws full of curved fangs. They inhabit warm tropical oceans, congregating in packs around rocky sea mounts, coral reefs, and sunken cities to hunt smaller fish, and occasionally Mermen or Sea Elves. They are fast-swimming opportunistic hunters, making escape impossible underwater. They are fished in Arantis as an edible delicacy called "sarul." The largest numbers are found near Keladon on Stayng Island in the Arrowhead Archipelago, specifically in "Barracuda Bay," where they gather to breed, spawn, and die.
