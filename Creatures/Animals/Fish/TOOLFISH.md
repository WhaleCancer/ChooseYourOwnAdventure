## Description

Living underwater presents many problems for the various aquatic races that populate the seas of Titan, such as making tools for craftwork and construction. The Merfolk have solved this by breeding fish for specific purposes, creating "Toolfish." These are found in Merfolk workshops, can be bought, and are enchanted to grow in size when used.

Sawfish are the only Toolfish that fight independently, with the statistics listed above. Other Toolfish (except Glowfish) have SKILL 6 and STAMINA 2. Five types are presented here, with more possible.

**Axefish:** A metre-long fish with a heavy, horned beak, originally bred for crushing coral. It is now used as a chopping tool and can be a weapon (damage equal to a Battle Axe, but with a -2 penalty to the wielder's Attack Strength).

**Borerfish:** A small, stout fish with a corkscrew nose, used for drilling holes in various materials, including ship hulls.
