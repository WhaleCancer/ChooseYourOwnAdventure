## Description

**Merfolk** are, quite simply, the people of the sea. They may once have been human, but their bodies are now perfectly adapted to life under the waves.

Their upper halves are as normal humans, except that they have a pale blue-green tint. They have air-breathing lungs, but there are also gill-slits in the sides of their neck, usually hidden by their long flowing hair. From the waist downwards, though, each has a tail like a fish, covered in scales. They can swim very fast using their tails, yet still carry weapons or objects in their hands. They make their homes in caves and sheltered corners on the ocean floor, where they grow crops of seaweed, algae and other food.

### Mermen

The **Mermen** are the warriors of the race. Proud and haughty, they may sometimes be seen patrolling the depths with dolphins, on the look-out for sharks or other predators. They will usually be carrying spears or tridents, and sometimes shields. They have no time for the affairs of the surface world, and will treat the infrequent humans they encounter with disdain.

### Mermaids

The females of the species, the **Mermaids**, have a different view of the world beyond the waters. A lone Mermaid may sometimes be met basking on a rock in a secluded part of the sea-shore, singing to herself. The song of a Mermaid is so enchanting that all males who hear it will immediately fall in love with her. She will choose one of them, and beckon him into the water with her. The chosen person will desperately want to do this, but may Test for Luck to see if all his resistance is overcome. In this case, if he is Unlucky, he will resist the Mermaid's song, her spell will be broken and she will swim away alone. If her victim has been charmed, and no one tries to stop him, they will dive beneath the waves together to live under the sea. In time, his body will adapt until he becomes a Merman, and the Mermaid will come looking for another human.
