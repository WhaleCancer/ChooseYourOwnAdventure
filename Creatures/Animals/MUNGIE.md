## Description

Similar in appearance to Wraith Apes, but somewhat smaller,
MUNGIES appear in packs of three to five. They move with
lightning-quick reactions.
They attack in packs and must be fought as a single creature,
adding 1 SKILL and 3 STAMINA for each additional Mungie
in the pack. The creatures have glowing red eyes and have
the advantage of night vision.
As plants are attracted towards the sun, Mungies are
uncontrollably drawn towards Gold. They are the ultimate
natural pickpockets, using their nimble reactions to pilfer
Gold from the packs or even the pockets of any adventurers
whose concentration wanders. They prefer to steal at night,
when there is less chance that they will be spotted. Anyone
asleep in a Mungie area will without doubt fall foul of their
thievery. In fact, anyone walking through Mungie territory
even in broad daylight will have to Test for Luck to see
whether the Mungies are successful.
But apart from this lust for Gold, Mungies are quite harmless
and will attack only in self-defence. An adventurer may only
attack them (i.e. will only be able to follow their quick
movements) if he has a SKILL of 10+ at night or 9+ during the
day. Anyone with a lesser SKILL will just not be able to catch
the little creatures.
More unscrupulous adventurers have often wondered
whether it would be possible to train a Mungie to steal Gold
for their own purposes. In fact this is possible, but no one has
so far succeeded. Only a wizard would be able to capture one
of the little creatures and then cast a Control Creature spell.
