## Description

Common Bats are found in most places across central and southern Allansia and Kakhabad. Typically coloured somewhere between light brown and dark grey, they look like nothing so much as flying mice, with a pair of leathery wings stretched out between their elongated front legs. Their ears are large in comparison to the rest of their heads, and help them fly in darkness by picking up echoes off solid objects around them.

Common Bats usually avoid creatures larger than themselves. They feed on mice, voles, insects and sometimes berries and fruit. They can be a hazard to an adventurer who suddenly disturbs a large number of them and finds himself being battered on all sides by a whole frightened flock! The whole flock can be treated as a single opponent: the Bats buffet with their wings, get tangled in hair or clothes, and so on. When their STAMINA score reaches zero, this indicates that the Bats have flown away and are no longer a threat, rather than that the adventurer has killed every single one of them!
