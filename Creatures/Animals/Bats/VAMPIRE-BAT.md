## Description

Vampire Bats are found in most places across central and southern Allansia and Kakhabad. Typically coloured somewhere between light brown and dark grey, they look like nothing so much as flying mice, with a pair of leathery wings stretched out between their elongated front legs. Their ears are large in comparison to the rest of their heads, and help them fly in darkness by picking up echoes off solid objects around them.

Vampire Bats are far more dangerous than Common Bats, for they are predatory creatures that live by sucking the blood of living things. They look much like normal Bats, though they are larger. They have greatly enlarged front teeth, which they will use to pierce the flesh of their victims. If there is more than one Vampire Bat involved in an attack, the other(s) will land on their opponent and automatically begin sucking 1 STAMINA point each per round, until he is killed.
