## Description

Giant Bats are only found in the warmer climate of the southern jungles, where they feed on monkeys, small deer and other similar creatures. Their wings span about two metres when fully extended, as the Bats soar high in the night sky. They are not afraid to attack humans, though fire will keep them at bay. Once they have killed their prey, they will carry it in their strong claws back to their caves to be eaten.
