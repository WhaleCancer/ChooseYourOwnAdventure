## Description

This vicious beast is the largest type of Vampire Bat known to man. Up to two metres in length with a five-metre wingspan, the CAVE VAMPIRE is found only in the deepest, darkest caverns, mostly in mountainous regions where local geology provides caverns large enough to house it.

The Cave Vampire differs in several respects from the common bat, other than its size. It has very large and light-sensitive eyes, which it uses instead of sonar waves. It also has a very keen sense of smell, and when in its own cave system can pick up the scent of its quarry from up to a kilometre away. It is particularly voracious and will attack and feed on any living thing.

Although it is not that intelligent, it does have a natural cunning and will avoid difficult fights or overwhelming odds. They typically live in extensive cavern systems and rarely venture outside, though some forage at night, attacking livestock, human beings, and any potential prey.

The Cave Vampire attacks with its claws (three on each wing and two clawed feet) and teeth, specifically two large sabre-like canines. Its tactic is to wrap its wings around the victim and sink its teeth into the neck. It is incredibly strong, making escape difficult. Adventurers caught must Test for Luck, with a penalty for pointed objects. Unlucky victims suffer Large Bite STAMINA damage until they die or break free.

**Weakness:** The Cave Vampire's eyesight is so sensitive to light that it avoids bright light and its own reflection. Warriors in shining plate armour can often avoid attack by reflecting light—it pays to keep your armour clean!
