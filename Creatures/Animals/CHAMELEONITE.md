Often a victim's first sighting of a CHAMELEONITE is
also their last, as these stone-hued creatures use their
colour-changing abilities to apparently materialize out of
thin air and attack with surprise (see Advanced Fighting
Fantasy, p. 64). They are vaguely humanoid and distantly
related to Lizard Men and Calacorms, walking about on
two legs with strange, jerky movements. Chameleonites
have scaly skin and coiled, prehensile tails, with bulbous
eyes and long tongues that protrude from their mouths.
They favour simple weapons in combat such as stone
clubs and flint-tipped spears. Chameleonites are found in
isolated rugged or forested areas, such as the Moonstone
Hills of Allansia, the jungles of southern Arantis, and the
tropical isles of the Western Ocean, such as Bone Island
or Skull Island.
Fresh or dried Chameleonite blood is much sought after
as a component to various magical adjuncts, especially
Potions of Transformation, and is imbued with colour-
changing properties (see Advanced Fighting Fantasy, p. 145
for further details). It sometimes has an adverse effect
when used fresh however. If an adventurer ever smears
fresh Chameleonite blood on their skin then roll a die and
consult the following table to see what happens:
Roll Effect
One arm becomes numb. Lose 2 SKILL points.

Cannot use shield or two-handed weapons.
Suffer from fever. Lose 1 SKILL and 4 STAMINA

points. These can be healed later.
3-6  Immune to side-effects. Add 1 LUCK point!
Finally, rumours abound of a more intelligent variety
known as the CHAMELEON MAN who dwells only in
the most remote jungles. These creatures live high up in
houses carved within the living trunks of great trees, and
use more advanced weaponry, such as swords and
daggers. Some are even capable of casting magic spells!
Supposedly, there are Chameleon Men living on the
mysterious and volcanic isle of Orcmoot, off the northern
coast of Khul, but little else is known about them at this
point in time.
