## Description

Bears may be encountered by adventurers in many wild areas across the northern lands. Even in the ice-bound coastal regions north of the Icefinger Mountains, snow-white Polar Bears dwell. Most bears are omnivores – eating meat, fish, berries, plants and fruit, depending upon what they can find.

If a Bear feels threatened, it will put on a very aggressive show of strength. Rising up on its hind legs, it will advance, growling warily, before attacking with teeth and claws. If more than one Bear is encountered, the others will be cubs, miniature replicas of their parent. The parent will make distinctly threatening noises towards anyone encountered, and may well attack immediately. Bears are very protective of their cubs, and will not wait to see whether they really are in danger before they attack.

Good-quality bearskins will fetch a high price in most towns and larger villages, for they are used to make all sorts of fine clothes.
