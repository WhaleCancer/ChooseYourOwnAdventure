## Description

The huge snow-white Polar Bear is the largest bear to be found on Titan, excluding certain weird and rare hybrids such as the Arctolyce and the Nandibear. It is found across the polar northern regions, from the endless Ice Wastes of Allansia, to frozen islands such as the Diamond and Cragspider archipelagos, and all of the pack-ice that covers the ocean in between. In coastal regions Polar Bears prey on fish, seals, and walrus, while further inland they have been known to hunt snow deer, moose and young Mammoth calves. They are hunted in turn by Frost Giants, who value their pelts above all others for its thickness and warmth. Northern Barbarians, by contrast, venerate them as emissaries of Gurrang the Bear God, and keep carved ivory statues of Polar Bears as a protection against their attacks. Some Barbarians are even known to be infected with a form of Lycanthropy that turns them into ravening white-furred Werebears when the full moon shines down upon the frozen tundra!
