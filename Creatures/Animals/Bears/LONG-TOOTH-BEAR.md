## Description

The Long-Tooth Bear is a smaller creature, albeit armed with a pair of curved sabre-like fangs that give it its name. It is a subterranean animal, found in caves and caverns across southern Khul, such as the extensive Chasms of Malice that exist beneath the Kingdom of Gorak. Long-Tooth Bears usually eat small underground mammals, although they are not averse to preying on Goblins or Orcs if the need so arises. They will lair in a shallow cave or fissure from which they can patrol the surrounding tunnels in their constant hunt for food.

## Special Abilities

Long-Tooth Bears are highly territorial, and will defend their lair to the death!
