## Description

Like its name suggests, the Grizzly Bear is a hungry brute with a nasty temper that is found across Titan, from the foothills of Allansia's Frozen Plateau, to the forested highlands of both Mauristatia and the Mountains of the Giants, and even on the more isolated islands of the Arrowhead Archipelago. They are perhaps the second largest bear after the Polar Bear and when they rear up to attack, stand over three metres tall on their tree-trunk thick hind legs. Grizzly Bears are inevitably battle-scarred veterans of the wilderness, and their raking talons and brute power are enough to see off most adversaries.

## Special Abilities

It is possible to distract Grizzly Bears with food, and at least 6 Provisions worth of meals are needed to successfully do so! Alternatively, one may climb a tree to escape the predations of a Grizzly Bear, for they are too large to follow, but they are also patient and have been known to wait for days for their prey to descend or fall.
