## Description

CROCODILES may be found lining the banks of rivers and
lakes throughout the warm southern lands, though they have
been reported much further north. These huge reptiles, often
as much as six metres long, are known for their voracious
appetites, and they spend much of their day swimming in
search of fish, or larger prey if they are lucky, visible only as
a pair of eyes peeking out above the surface. 'The rest of the
time, they will be basking on the shore in the sun. Crocodiles
may be tremendously aggressive, and are not afraid to attack
men or other creatures which disturb them. They are not so
skilled when fighting on land (their SKILL being reduced by
2 points), but if they can lure or drag their prey into the water
to fight, they will prove deadly opponents.
