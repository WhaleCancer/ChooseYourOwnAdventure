## Description

MAMMOTHS are huge shaggy-haired beasts, similar to ele-
phants, but dwelling chiefly in cooler climes. They are rare
creatures, encountered most frequently on the barren north-
ern plains around the Icefinger Mountains, but a few scat-
tered herds have been reported in other icy areas. They are
usually coloured a deep brown, with large curving tusks
extending out in front of them. They are fairly docile, and
wander in small herds in search of vegetation to feed upon.
Mammoths are also rather stupid, and a whole herd can take
fright from the threatening movements of a much smaller
creature. There will be a larger male Mammoth with most
herds, however, who will valiantly attack to defend his cows
and calves. In an attack, a bull Mammoth will rear on its back
legs, brandishing its tusks threateningly, and attempt to
knock over and trample its enemy.
Mammoths are hunted by many of the northern tribes, both
humans and Toa-Suo, for their meat, ivory and warm shaggy
pelts. Folk-legends told by the shamans of such tribes tell of
when the plains were greener and the Mammoth roamed
everywhere. Such times are long gone, for the plains are now
desolate and grey, and the Mammoth are being hunted into
extinction.
