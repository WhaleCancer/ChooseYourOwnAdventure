## Description

The KORVEN are a race of reclusive forest-dwellers

from Khul, being found in a wide arc across that

continent

from

the

wooded

foothills

of

the

Cloudhigh Mountains in the west to the dark

depths of the Forest of Shadows in the east. They

are

small

humanoids,

resembling

evil-faced

Goblins, but with claws instead of feet and black-

feathered

wings
