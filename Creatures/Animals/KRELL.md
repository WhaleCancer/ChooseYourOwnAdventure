## Description

Wild — Forests, Jungles
Tame — Towns, anywhere men are
Originally found in the steamy jungle of the east, KRELL are
six-armed ape-like creatures. Covered in thick mats of brown
hair, they are incredibly nimble, and swing dextrously
through the trees at great speeds. In the wild, Krell are very
hard to find, since they are very shy creatures, who blend
into the thick jungle foliage. They live in small family
groups, hunting and eating parrots, rats and other small
creatures, as well as fruit and roots.
The quick wits of the Krell make them ideal as pets or magi-
cal familiars for wizards and other characters. They are high-
ly suited to sneaking, spying and thieving, as much at home
clambering up walls and over roof _tops as they are swing-
ing through trees. In a fight they can be quite vicious, hang-
ing on to their foe with as many limbs as possible, and then
biting with sharp, pointed teeth.
Occasionally, their masters will teach them simple tricks,
such as juggling or tumbling, and some Krell are dressed in

miniature suits of clothes and taught to bow and be courte-
ous. In their natural habitats, Krell communicate in a compli-
cated language of clicks and chatters. A few of their owners
learn this language, but none can match the achievement of
the Arch-wizard Belandros, who taught his Krell to speak
the language of men.
