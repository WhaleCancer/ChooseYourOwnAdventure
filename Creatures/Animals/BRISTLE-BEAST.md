## Description

BRISTLE BEASTS are most commonly encountered as pets,
belonging to well-travelled or rich city-dwellers in Blacksand
or Khare. They are lizard-like creatures, growing to the size
of a large dog, and covered in thousands of short, sharp
spines. They originally come from the warm plains of the
southern lands, where they live in burrows dug in the

sandy earth. They eat small mammals and insects, which they
will often play with before killing, just like a cat. They can be
domesticated, if training starts early enough, and will prove
loyal and obedient, provided they are fed and cared for. They
will never permit themselves to be leashed, though they can
be trained to walk close at heel when accompanying their
owner in the street. They are especially useful as guard-
animals, for they will ferociously attack any intruder - their
spines erect, hissing through their teeth, pacing warily before
an opponent before striking with their claws. If necessary,
they will fight to the death for their master, though their
owner will usually try to stop the fight before that happens,
for they are rare and expensive beasts.
