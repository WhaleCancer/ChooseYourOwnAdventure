## Description

WILD BOAR are hunted for their choice meat and pelts in
many areas across northern Allansia. They look like huge
pigs, covered in tangled clumps of short brown hair. They are
brutish, aggressive beasts, and will stand and fight with their
tusks, if threatened, with an almost berserk fury.
Occasionally, those encountered will be a single male and a
number of smaller sows. In this case, the male will stand its
ground, holding off danger while the others escape into the
undergrowth. The pelt and meat of a fair-sized Boar can fetch
a few Gold Pieces in the market-place of any village or town.
