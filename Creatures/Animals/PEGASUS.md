## Description

The Pegasus is a magical winged horse, always the purest white in colour, which is seen only rarely in this world. It dwells mostly on the Magical Plane of Air, though it will sometimes be encountered in the remotest of mountains high above the clouds, where it can live without disturbance. Shy creatures, they can be summoned by someone with a good heart by the promise of silver. For such a gift, they will carry a passenger anywhere he wishes to go. They are very strong and can fly at great speed. They are also highly intelligent, but speak only the languages of aerial creatures. If danger threatens, they can fight with their hoofs if necessary, but will normally just blink back to the Magical Plane and safety.
