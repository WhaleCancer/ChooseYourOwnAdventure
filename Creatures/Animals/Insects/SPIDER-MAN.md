## Description

The strange creatures known as SPIDER MEN are the result
of a particularly cruel joke played by a Demon Prince upon
a coven of its acolytes. They had asked their master to change
them into Death Spiders, so that they might ensnare more
souls for it. On a sadistic whim, it decided to show these
puny humans what a curse a spider's body could be.
Spider Men look much like a Death Spider, with a human
head on top of a spider's hairy body. However, where the
Death Spider's body grew to match the size of its head, the
Spider Men's heads diminished to match their bodies, leav-
ing them about ten centimetres across! Since they were loyal
servants, though, their Demon Prince master endowed them
with a fatal poisonous bite, before leaving them to scuttle
about the world.
They are foul-tempered little things, for they begrudge ev-
erything that draws breath, and they will attack anything
they encounter with a berserk fury that would be laughable
in something their size were it not so serious. Should they
manage to bite their opponent, their venomous fangs will
inject a fatal poison that will incapacitate him in a few brief
moments, and kill him quickly but painfully a little while
later.
