## Description

Taking their name from the Baddu-Bak Plains of Kakhabad
where they were first encountered, BADDU-BEETLES are

ferocious predatory insects which can grow up to four metres
long. It is the way they obtain their food that can be most
alarming, however. These solitary hunters bury themselves
in the earth and drag loose soil over themselves until no trace
remains on the surface to betray their presence. When they
hear the vibrations caused by another creature passing by,
they burst out and grab at their prey with their huge serrated
claws.
Once they have emerged from their burrow, they may be
fought normally. However, whenever the creature is hit, it
will angrily spit a virulent acid at its opponent. On a roll of
1-4 on one die, it will hit and burn away 2 STAMINA points.
Once the Beetle has killed its prey, it will drag the corpse back
into its burrow to be slowly digested.
