## Description

Deep below the surface, monstrous insects chew their way
through rock and stone. ROCK GRUBS are enormous
creatures, looking like beetle-headed worms. They bore vast
tunnels, eating everything in their path with enormously
powerful mandibles, and leaving only a sticky trail of slime
behind them. They are completely blind, but they appear to
be able to sense the heat of living creatures. They are attracted
to warmth, and will attempt to eat any living things they
encounter, grasping them in their jaws and crushing them
before digesting them. Dwarfs sometimes follow Rock Grubs
as they burrow through the ground, for they know that the
creatures can uncover seams of precious metals, ready to be
mined.
