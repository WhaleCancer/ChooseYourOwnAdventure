## Description

WATER SPIDERS are gangly-legged creatures that

have taken up an aquatic existence in rivers,

streams, lakes and large tracts of wetland. They are

especially plentiful

in the

Mizokumo Fens

the Giant Water Spiders have been trained by the

villages and their inhabitants while the warriors are
