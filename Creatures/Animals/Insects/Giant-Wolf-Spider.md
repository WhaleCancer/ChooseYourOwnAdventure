## Description

The GIANT WOLF SPIDER is a type of carnivorous

arachnid that has forsaken the webs and snares of

its relatives and instead opted for sheer speed and

brute ferocity. Fiercer than the wolf it is named

after, the Giant Wolf Spider will use its excellent

eyesight to hunt prey, pouncing on a victim from

cover, or even chasing it over short distances. This

huge spider has a body well over a metre long, with

the spread of the immense legs more than double

that.

Giant Wolf Spiders are found in wooded habitats

such as the Forest of Night or the foothills of

Mauristatia. In the la;er locale they have been

afflicted with the warp of Chaos, with their heads

becoming some grotesque amalgam of wolf and

spider, their muzzles forced out of shape by huge

clacking mandibles and truly becoming lupine

arachnids.
