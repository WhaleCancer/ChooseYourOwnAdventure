## Description

The most common of the species of GIANT BEETLE

is also one of the biggest, a gigantic creature up to

four metres long with a jet black armoured carapace

and huge curved cla;ering mandibles. They are

carnivorous insects that prefer fresh meat, though

they will quite happily scavenge on carrion as well.

Giant Beetles are not especially intelligent and can

usually be distracted with food quite easily. Dark

Elves and Troglodytes have both been known to

domesticate Giant Beetles; the former use them as

transport, carrying passengers through the long

tunnels between the baroque se;lements of the

Darkside Elves, whereas for the la;er they are

enormous ba;le-steeds and usually fi;ed with a

howdah containing

two to

twelve Troglodyte

warriors armed with bows and flint-tipped arrows.
