## Description

The GIANT STAG BEETLE is a huge insect up to

two

metres

long,

with

an

enormous,

black

antlers – but it is much more ferocious than any

stag. They are highly aggressive and will charge

anything that strays into their territory. However

they are also rather slow, and as the Giant Stag

Beetle lumbers towards its intended victim, they

will have enough time to either Test their Skill and

jump out of the way or fire up to three arrows at the

gargantuan insect before it closes for combat. Giant

Stag
