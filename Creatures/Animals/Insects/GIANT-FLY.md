## Description

The various species of GIANT FLY are normally found only
in warm regions, where they will be encountered flying
around looking for suitable food for themselves and their
young. COMMON FLIES can reach one and a half metres in
length, with a wingspan twice that. They are disgusting
creatures, with huge eyes, black bodies covered with stiff
hairs, and a long, sharp proboscis for eating with. They will
attack any creature up to and including the size of humans.
If it wins an Attack Round, instead of causing damage the
Giant Fly will try to fly off with its prey. Unless he can
successfully Test for Luck, its victim will be dragged up into
the air and dropped, causing 1 die worth of STAMINA dam-
age.
GIANT FIREFLIES are only a third of the size of a Common
Fly, but they are just as aggressive. They are only encoun-
tered at night, when the rear of their bodies glows in the
darkness. If they hit their prey, there is a 3 in 6 chance that
they will also deliver a discharge of electricity, causing 2
points of STAMINA damage. NEEDLEFLIES look like enor-
mous hornets, about a metre in length, with a long, sharp
sting poking from their tails. They attack with their abdo-
mens curled under them, so that this sting is pointing for-
wards, and swoop back and forth, trying to stab their prey
before carrying it off to eat.
