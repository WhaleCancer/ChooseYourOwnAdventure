## Description

GIANT CENTIPEDES can be found in many dank, desolate
places. Up to four metres long, these monsters are covered in
tough, bony plates of black, chitinous armour. They scuttle
around at high speed on many tiny legs, which enable them
to cope with all kinds of rough terrain. They are scavengers,
feeding on dead meat and rotting vegetation, but will also
chase and catch live food. The first indication of the presence
of a Giant Centipede is a strange clicking noise, which is
caused by the scales of its armour rubbing together as it
rushes along. In an attack, if room permits, it will dart
forward, raise itself on its hind legs and bite with its large,
strong mandibles. Some jungle-dwelling species have
poisonous bites, which will deliver an extra 2 points of
damage to a successful bite. Such creatures are rare,
thankfully, and dwell only in the far eastern lands, so that
they are encountered only infrequently by man.
