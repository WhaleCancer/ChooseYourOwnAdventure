## Description

GIANT SCORPIONS are fearsome creatures found in many
parts of the world, from temperate wastelands to the burning
hot sands of deserts. They are aggressive predators, and are
not afraid of attacking humans. Around three metres in
length, they are covered in shiny black or brown armour.
Their huge claws extend out on strong limbs, and above their
backs hangs their deadly sting, as large as a man's head.
Their typical tactic is to grasp their victim with a dextrous
claw and lash him with their sting. Each claw can attack
independently; if it is taking on a lone prey, it will attack with
both of them at once. If a Giant Scorpion gets a strong grip on
its opponent (if 22 is rolled for its Attack Strength or, in the
case of two opponents, if both Attacks are successful), its sting
will whip forward and inject a fatal poison that will take scant
seconds to kill the victim(s). Once its prey is dead, the Giant
Scorpion will drag the fresh corpse into its bone-littered cave
or a shady corner, and eat it.
