## Description

Warriors — 1-6

The XOROA are a strange race of mutated ant men, with the
head and torso of a human and the lower body and legs of a
giant ant, almost like an 'ant-centaur'. They stand about two
metres tall, and are a deep red-brown colour all over. The
human parts appear quite normal, but a Xoroa has no outer
ears, and two flexible ant-like feelers extend forward from
the top of its head. Their eyes are silver, and can see in the
dark, and their sense of smell is very acute. They communi-
cate with one another, and with the giant ants they some-
times herd, in a language made up of strange clicks and
hums. The ant parts join their bodies just below the waist,
allowing the Xoroa to walk on four legs, and negotiate quite
rough and steep terrain with ease.
The Xoroa live in large underground colonies, visible from
the surface only as a small hill of fresh earth with a large
opening in the summit. The area around the colony is pa-
trolled at all times by Xoroa Warriors, who watch over small
groups of Workers, which forage for food for the whole
colony. Workers are slightly smaller in height and build than
the Warriors, as well as being lighter in colour and less
intelligent. Warriors on guard-duty will often carry short
spears and javelins, and occasionally slings. Some will also
carry carved bone horns, to warn one another of approach-
ing danger.
In their colonies there are many small, hollowed-out cham-
bers. Some are used for storing food and equipment; others
are living-quarters for the inhabitants - large, communal,
straw-covered dormitories for the Workers, individual
chambers for the Warriors. Most, however, are nurseries for
the strange Xoroa larvae. Born from a large, bloated Queen
as soft-skinned eggs, they hatch within a few hours into
small, but very helpless, versions of the adult Xoroa. The
queen has a dozen or so 'nursemaids' who feed and rear the
young until they are able to fend for themselves. A colony
can support anything up to two hundred Xoroa, of whom
perhaps half will be young, and two thirds of the remaining
number will be Workers.
