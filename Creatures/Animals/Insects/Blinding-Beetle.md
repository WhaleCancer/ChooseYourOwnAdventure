## Description

BLINDING BEETLES are smaller relatives of the

Giant Fire Beetle (see below) that prefer to dwell

underground where possible. Here they can be

found living in small groups, usually grazing on

mould and lichen, making high-pitched clicking

noises

to

communicate

with

one

another.

If

disturbed, these noises will increase in pitch and

become more and more frantic, until the Blinding

Beetles are harassed to the flash-point that gives

them their name. These large insects have the

power to emit extremely bright bursts of light,

which are

powerful enough
