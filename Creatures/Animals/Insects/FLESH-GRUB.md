## Description

Mooching about in old tombs or dungeons may be the best
way for an adventurer to gain fame and fortune, but it is not
without its hazards. As well as the larger creatures there are
many smaller dangers, such as FLESH GRUBS. These dis-
gusting maggot-like worms lurk writhing in rotting debris
and other hidden corners, waiting for the tell-tale scent of
human flesh to waft by. They are blind, but can easily smell
out their target before latching on to it with barbed teeth.
Each Flesh Grub will automatically inflict 1 point of STAMI-
NA damage as it nibbles away at the fresh meat. The nasty
little creatures can be pulled off and crushed easily, but only
six can be removed in one round.
