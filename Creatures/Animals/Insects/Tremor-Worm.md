## Description

Thought to be related to the subterranean Rock

Grub, the TREMOR WORM is a gigantic insect

known from the grassy plains and barren flatlands

of the Old World. They are monstrous worm-like

creatures, hence their appellation, about the size of

a hay-cart or even larger and looking like a cross

between a white caterpillar and a maggot. Tremor

dome-like olfactory organs on their eyeless heads,

and their snapping mandibles are strong enough to

bite through plate armour. They hunt in small

packs, burrowing through the dirt and soil beneath

the surface of the lowland plains. When suitable

prey is detected, whether it be a herd of wild horses

or a merchant’s mule-train, the Tremor Worms will

shoot up to the surface, causing the ground to

shudder underfoot, as if an earthquake had struck
