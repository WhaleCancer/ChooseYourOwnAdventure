## Description

ness, Deserts
Found in many parts of the world, from the hottest desert to
the dampest swamp, GIANT SPIDERS are frightening pred-
ators. Constantly on the look-out for food, these huge black
monsters grow to prodigious sizes, with bodies sometimes
over a metre across. Some hunt their prey by stalking them
silently before striking. Others build webs, vast sticky nets
designed to entangle any creature that comes too near. Any-
one caught in a Giant Spider's web must roll his current
SKILL score or below on two dice twice, to escape its tangles.
While he is struggling free, the Spider can make an automat-
ic attack, biting deeply for 2 points of damage. Webs burn
easily, though anyone caught in a blazing web will take 2
dice of STAMINA damage, unless they can escape in time.
