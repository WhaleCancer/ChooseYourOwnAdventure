## Description

Skimming at high speed just above the reeds on the hunt for
a suitable meal, GIANT DRAGONFLIES are dazzling but
dangerous creatures. They prey on any warm-blooded crea-
tures they can catch, even men, swooping down and biting
with their large mandibles. A Giant Dragonfly will hover
threateningly over a potential victim for a long while before
striking, its delicate wings a blur of movement as it hangs
motionless. Then they will drop on to their prey, grab and
restrain it with their legs, and bite deeply. The skin of a Giant
Dragonfly is exquisitely patterned and coloured, and can
fetch a good price from a high-class tailor in a large city, by
whom it is used to make fine cloaks or tunics for princes and
noblemen.
