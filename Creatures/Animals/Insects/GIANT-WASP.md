## Description

GIANT WASPS are rare but deadly insects, found in desert-
ed sites, well away from civilization. They will attack almost
anything they encounter, to feed both themselves and the
larvae in their gigantic nests. They are almost two metres
long from antennae to sting, with wings three metres across;
they can fly at great speed, and often use a fast dive to attack.
When assailing large prey, they will try to grasp it with their
legs and then sting it. If an attack succeeds, they will do
damage as normal, but also leave the barbed, arrow-like
sting impaled in their victim. The sting's coating of poison
will cause loss of a further 2 points of STAMINA and 1 point
of SKILL. The insects are very afraid of fire, however, which
can damage the thin membranes of their wings, and a Giant
Wasp can often be driven away by nothing more than a
blazing torch.
