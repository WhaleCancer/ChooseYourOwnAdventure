## Description

Elverines are ferocious fresh-water serpents from southern Khul, capable of eating humans. They are curiously blind with bulging blank eyes, tracking prey by smell and water disturbances. They attack by tearing chunks of flesh with powerful bites from their fang-lined jaws. Their habitat is muddy, slow-moving water like the Kishian Delta or River Parine.

The exiled sage Asahara of Lagash controversially considers them "young of Sea Serpents," dwelling in fresh-water until they grow and develop eyesight before returning to the ocean.
