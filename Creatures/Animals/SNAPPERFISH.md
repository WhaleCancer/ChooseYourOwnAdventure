## Description

The SNAPPERFISH is an infrequent hazard found in a num-
ber of locations across Allansia and beyond. Little larger than
a man's hand, it is nevertheless equipped with amazingly

powerful jaws and teeth like a row of fine needles. Snapper-
fish are savage carnivores, despite their size, and can always
detect potential food when it is in the same body of water as
them. Their bite is even worse than that of a Piranha, both
doing physical damage and causing a great shock to their
victim's nervous system: it does 3 points of STAMINA dam-
age and 1 point of SKILL damage. Once the prey is dead,
they will strip the flesh from it in a few minutes, leaving only
the bare bones to drift to the bottom...
