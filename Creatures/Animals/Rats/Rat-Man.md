## Description

Alchemists and sorcerers have long laboured to create hybrid creatures to serve them as warriors and slaves. Many such experiments have been in cross-breeding men with hardier species. Some have worked well, but others have produced weak, regressive breeds like the **Rat Men**.

A little over one and a half metres tall, they have the bodies of humans, but the heads of rats, with big eyes and ears, sensitive whiskers and large front teeth. They are covered in short, soft fur, and they have long rat-like tails. Rat Men dress in humans' clothing, and can speak their language, but are otherwise shunned, made outcasts by their appearance. They have long been banished to sewers and old ruins in the wastelands, where they dwell in small groups, catching and eating anything they can.

Despite their weakness, Rat Men are dextrous and have become skilled with snares, traps and slings. They can track well, sniffing the air to pick up a scent. They will try to strike from a distance, for they are not so skilled with their shortswords, preferring to use them only when finishing off a trapped prey prior to eating it.
