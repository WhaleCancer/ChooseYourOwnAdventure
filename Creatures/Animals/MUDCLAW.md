## Description

MUDCLAWS are small, two-legged amphibians which dwell
in small colonies among the thickets of reeds and rushes on
the fringes of marshes and river-banks. Standing only half a
metre or so tall, they are coloured in mottled patterns of green
and brown blotches, which provide them with good
camouflage against larger predators. They have powerful legs
with wide, webbed toes, allowing them to both run and swim
at high speed. They have a high ridge of bony spikes across
their backs, and a short tail which helps them steer when
swimming. Their short arms finish in surprisingly strong
prehensile hands, which are equipped with short, sharp claws.
Mudclaws will eat almost anything they can find, including
fish, insects and plants, but are most fond of warm-blooded
meat. They will take rats, voles and stray herd animals, and
will occasionally gang together to assail lone adventurers.
Many an unwary traveller has suddenly found himself being
assaulted on all sides by the ravenous little beasts, slashing
and rending with dagger-sharp claws, trying to drag him into
the water before tearing off strips to eat. In such a coordinated
attack, they can be more deadly than Piranhas, though smaller
groups tend to be less blatant and more selective in their
choice of meals.
The creatures live in dens similar to those built by beavers,
small hut-like structures of woven reeds covered with mud
and grass. Their young cannot provide for themselves until
almost fully grown, relying instead on the food brought by
their intriguingly loyal parents.
