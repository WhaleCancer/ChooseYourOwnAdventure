## Description

Rarely seen during the day, WRAITH APES are a fiercely
territorial species of large monkey. They hunt at night, usu-
ally in packs of three or four. Left to themselves, they will
avoid humans, but if they find any sort of bipedal creature
trespassing on their territory while they are patrolling at
night, they will attack without warning.
Their short-haired fur is as black as coal, which serves to
camouflage them at night, while they stalk their territory. A
sharp-eyed observer (with a SKILL of 9+) will be able to spot
them just before they approach, but only by their glowing
red eyes. Wraith Apes have night vision and, when they
attack at night, will add 2 to their Attack Strength against any
creature without night vision.
However, such an observer must be looking for them high in
the trees. Wraith Apes are so called because of their method
of attack. A large fold of skin under each arm allows these
creatures limited powers of flight. Throwing themselves
from a high perch, they are able to glide deftly down upon
their victims and land accurately in front of them. To anyone
who has never come across a Wraith Ape before, this fright-
ening spectre appears as a frenzied Wraith, silhouetted
against the night sky.
Wraith Apes have another dangerous ability: they have
learned to use the leaves of the Blade Tree as a weapon.
Blade Trees have sharp, broad-bladed leaves which grow at
the ends of strong branches. The leaves themselves are as
hard as rock, so these makeshift weapons are equivalent to a
sharpened stone axe, and will add 1 point to the Wraith
Apes' SKILL.
