## Description

The CAVE CRAWLER is a large, hairy creature about the size of a bear that roams caves and tunnels, clinging to the ceiling. It is virtually blind and relies on its exceptional sense of smell and wide, sensitive ears. It emits a shrill scream to pinpoint prey using echolocation.

If adventurers press themselves against the cavern wall and Test for Luck, they may escape detection. If located, the Cave Crawler attacks by slashing out with its clawed paws while hanging from the ceiling. Its deafening screech causes opponents to lose STAMINA points on a roll of 1. The Cave Crawler feeds on dead prey while still clinging to the ceiling.
