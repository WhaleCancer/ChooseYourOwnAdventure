## Description

SABRE-TOOTHED TIGERS are highly dangerous but luckily
rare predatory cats, which dwell in warm, hilly regions. They
live on just about any fresh meat they can catch, usually deer
and wild boar, attacking with claws and the long fangs which
give the beasts their name. Despite their voracious appetites
and violent manner, Sabre-toothed Tigers are highly sought
after by human hunters, as well as cavemen and other
humanoids, for their magnificent pelts, which can fetch as
much as 1,000 Gold Pieces in a large town. Among many of
the primitive hill-tribes, a chief is chosen by a contest
involving the single-handed capture, killing and skinning of
a Sabre-toothed Tiger. The pelt is then proudly worn by the
new chief, as an unmistakable badge of his office.
