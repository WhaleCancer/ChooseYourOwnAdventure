## Description

BURROWBEARS are strange, subterranean creatures, so-called because they resemble bears to some extent, though they do not appear to be related. Indeed, certain scholars of natural history claim these animals are giant underground relatives of the Sloths one finds in the jungles and rainforests of Titan.

Burrowbears are large, hairy beasts, covered in sleek black or brown hair except for their long pink snouts. These are very sensitive, and used for smelling out the location of tasty roots or underground fungi which they live on. When such food is in short supply, a Burrowbear will venture much further afield, hunting out small underground settlements of Dwarfs, Orcs, or Goblins.

Burrowbears are formidable fighters, with retractable claws capable of tunneling through rock and slicing through armor. They occasionally venture to the surface, but are sensitive to sunlight and prefer to remain in darkness. They are solitary creatures, making their lairs in excavated caverns. Burrowbears don't value treasure, but their pelts can be sold for gold, and Dwarven tribes pay bounties for their skins.
