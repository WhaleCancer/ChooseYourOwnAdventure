## Description

The Bakk-Ruman is a creature that lurks in subterranean darkness, known as the "Wailer in the Depths" by Dwarfs due to its piercing screeches used to locate prey. It is over a metre tall, covered in thick black fur, with four limbs ending in taloned paws, short stocky legs, and elongated multi-jointed arms supporting sail-like membranous wings similar to those of a Pterodactyl. It has a large, vaguely human-shaped head with blind staring eyes, bat-like ears, and a small mouth full of sharp teeth.

## Special Abilities

The Bakk-Ruman's high-pitched shrieking call is physically painful, causing anyone fighting it in combat to deduct 2 points from their SKILL score.
