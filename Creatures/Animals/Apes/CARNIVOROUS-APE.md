## Description

Carnivorous Apes are large, intelligent primates that have adapted to a predatory lifestyle. Unlike their herbivorous cousins, these apes actively hunt for meat, using their powerful claws and sharp teeth to bring down prey. They are highly intelligent creatures, capable of planning hunts and working in pairs to corner their victims. Their light armour comes from their tough hide and thick fur, which provides some protection while allowing them to remain agile in their forest and jungle habitats.
