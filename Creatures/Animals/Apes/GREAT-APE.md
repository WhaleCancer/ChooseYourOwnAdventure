## Description

Great Apes look very much like huge hairy Gorillas, about two and a half metres tall and almost as broad. They are not confined to tropical regions, and may be encountered in all kinds of wild terrain. They are carnivorous beasts, delighting particularly in eating the tender flesh of humans. They attack with their huge fists, which are so strong that they can punch through armour! Great Apes typically make their lairs in old caves, or at the top of large trees, from where they swing out through the branches each day in search of food.

Although most Great Apes are unintelligent, aggressive brutes, there are a few remarkable species which have developed in isolation in a remote corner of Kakhabad. For more details of the Apes of Mauristatia, see the appropriate sections on Champaque, Howl Cat, Mungie and Wraith Ape.
