Possibly one of the most dread and hideous beasts to ever
swim the seas of Titan is the legendary KRAKEN, a
gargantuan squid-like monster big enough to sink a ship.
With its ten huge suckered tentacles, enormous staring
ink-black eyes, and a great, serrated beak-like mouth, the
Kraken is truly a nightmarish foe. As well as feeding on
sharks and small whales, it is not averse to attacking ships
and boats, plucking unfortunate sailors from the decks
with its long tentacles. In this case the combat scores given
above for individual tentacles will be used to represent
up to six tentacles attacking different victims, and if all the
tentacles are defeated the Kraken will be driven off. If a
victim is unfortunate enough to encounter the creature
underwater, then the creature’s whole combat score is
used, along with any penalties for underwater combat.
The alchemist Plidor, infamous for his research into
various tentacled molluscoid creatures, theorised that the
Kraken spawns at sea, though its young travel upstream
into fresh-water rivers and lakes, particularly in colder
climates, where they feed on salmon and schoolfish. Here
they lurk, often in flooded caves and deep pools, until
around half-grown, and are known as MOTTLED
KRAKEN for their blotched and warty appearance.
Separate combat scores for Mottled Kraken are given
above. They then return to the sea to attain their full size,
striking terror in all creatures as they glide through the
dark ocean waters of Titan.
Sometimes however, a Kraken may not make it back to its
salt-water domain and instead lair in a large inland lake
or tarn. It is known for example that a Kraken dwells in
the Spider Fens of Hachiman, where it pulls victims from
the Giant’s Causeway that crosses its mist-shrouded mere.
An equally mighty creature lives in the foul water of Lake
Nekros in northern Khul, and is rumoured to have
slaughtered Galrin’s Company, an entire band of
mercenaries that once camped on the lakeshore. Finally,
from the Inland Sea come tales of Reef Lurkers, a type of
Kraken with sulphurous yellow tentacles that lie in wait
in rocky undersea areas such as the Shoals of Trysta,
where they are a menace to the local shipping.
