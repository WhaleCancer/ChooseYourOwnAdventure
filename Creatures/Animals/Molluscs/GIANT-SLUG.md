## Description

Pale grey in colour, but spattered with foul-smelling green
slime, GIANT SLUGS roam through the fetid swamps in
search of suitable food, their huge bloated bodies dragging
slowly through the mire. Growing to almost eight metres
long and three metres across, they are vile, repulsive crea-
tures, their boneless bodies rippling disgustingly as they
slither along. They prefer to roam after sundown, for they
dislike bright light, and spend their days half-submerged in
mud in the shelter of the reeds.
Giant Slugs eat virtually anything edible, for they need large
amounts of food to keep their huge bodies alive. When it
comes to catching living things, however, they are rather too
slow and ponderous. So they have developed poisonous

saliva, which they are able to spit for quite a distance. The
stuff will hit its victim and cause 5 points of damage to his
STAMINA, unless he can dodge it by rolling his SKILL or
less on two dice. A Giant Slug can only spit once every hour,
so once it has done so it must close with its prey and fight by
trying to catch him in its huge mouth and swallowing him
whole.
