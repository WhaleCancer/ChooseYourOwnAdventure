## Description

Over cups of strong rum in the taverns of ports the length of
the land, wizened old sea-dogs tell tales of gigantic sea-
monsters which have attacked all sorts of ships from fishing

smacks to war-galleys. Closer to the land, such creatures are
smaller, but just as perilous. Lurking in caves and pools along
the coast, GIANT OCTOPUSES can sometimes be
encountered. Growing to quite alarming sizes, the creatures
are cunning predators, with strong, dextrous bodies. They
will attack and feed upon most living creatures, typically
anchoring themselves on a rock with two sucker-lined
tentacles and lashing out with the others.
Their favourite tactic is to grasp a creature, gradually enfold
it in their tentacles and crush the life out of it. Should a Giant
Octopus score two successful hits in succession, without
taking any in return, it will have grasped its opponent tightly
and will squeeze him for a further point of damage. Unless
its victim can break the hold by scoring a successful hit on the
creature in return, the crushing damage will increase by a
further point each time. Should the hold be loosened, the
Giant Octopus can start trying to score two successive hits
again, and so on, until one of the combatants is dead. Should
the Octopus find itself the victor, it will drag the corpse of its
victim beneath the water to be dismembered and eaten at
leisure.
