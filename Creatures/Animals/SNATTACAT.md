## Description

'As surprising as a SNATTACAT!' is an oft-used phrase
across the Baklands of central Kakhabad, for the powers of a
Snattacat are infamous. The beasts in question are man-eat-
ing predators, about the size of a large dog. They are covered
in short black fur slashed with yellow stripes, which camou-
flages them in the thick undergrowth of the depths of the
Forest of Snatta where they live. Their heads are like that of
a tiger, but with a snub, squat snout that gives them a rather
ugly appearance. Many unfortunate men and women –
hunters, farmers and adventurers – can attest to the sharp-
ness of their teeth and claws, and more.. .
Snattacats can turn themselves invisible at will, simply by
closing their eyes and concentrating. They can then attack
their prey without fear, hitting it automatically for 2 points
of damage. Trying to hit an invisible opponent is like fight-
ing in the dark, and will reduce an adventurer's SKILL by 2
points.
If he manages to hit a Snattacat, the beast will be dazed for a
while, lose concentration and reappear. In the next round, it
can be attacked normally, but unless the Snattacat is injured
further it will blink out of sight again the round after and
attack again. Once their prey has been killed, the whole pack
will feast– remaining invisible to do so, a most alarming
sight! – before a slight rustling in the long grass indicates that
they have moved on in search of more food.
