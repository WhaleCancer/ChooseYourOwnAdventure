## Description

The oceans of Titan are home to many kinds of Whales, which are cousins to Dolphins, from gigantic plankton-sifting baleen-bearing hulks, to spiral-horned narwhals, to tusked and beaked whales that dive deep into the sea's abyssal depths hunting for squid and octopi. In the beast-haunted waters of the Eelsea, Onyx, and Diamond Seas, lurks the most aggressive species, the brutish Bullwhale.

These are huge creatures, with powerful flukes and two curved horns emerging from either side of their wide, ram-like skull. Bullwhales are carnivores and their preferred prey is usually shoals of Schoolfish and the occasional Giant Squid. They live in pods of two to seven individuals, patrolling the seas for food.

While usually harmless, Bullwhales have learned to attack small whaling boats due to being hunted for their valuable ivory horns and oily deposits. A specific, gargantuan individual known as "the Black Whale" was slain by Captain Akab and his crew; this creature was much more powerful than a typical Bullwhale and resembled a Behemoth in size.
