## Description

Dolphins are marine mammals related to whales, found in all seas and oceans of Titan. They feed on fish and squid, and are hostile towards sharks and Sea Trolls, attacking them on sight by ramming with their strong snout and reinforced skull.

Dolphins are highly intelligent, possessing their own language of clicks, whistles, and calls, with each having a unique name (e.g., Keeekweet). They are friendly creatures, willing to help, and are important for Merfolk and Sea Elves as steeds, companions, and guards against evil undersea races. They are also friendly with Sea Giants, though communication can be slow.

They are typically found in small pods of one to six animals, but occasionally gather in larger groups of three to eighteen for food or defense. A "Dolphin Island" exists for large gatherings to feed.
