## Description

These strange six-legged reptilian creatures are

found in underground areas in all parts of Titan

except the coldest northern regions.

Their insect-

like features and beaks give them a very odd look,

but they

are strong

and dangerous

creatures.

Should an adventurer wander too close to a cave

inhabited by a SECTILE, it will a;empt to ward

them off with much hissing and spi;ing. If this

fails, the large creature will a;ack, pecking with its

horny beak and slashing with its taloned feet. If the

Sectile’s A;ack Strength totals 21 or more in any

given A;ack Round, it has successfully stabbed it

opponent with its barbed venomous tail, causing a

further 4 points of STAMINA damage.
