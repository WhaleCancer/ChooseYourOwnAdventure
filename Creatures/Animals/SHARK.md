## Description

SHARKS of all types may be found in the warm waters of the
southern half of the Western Ocean, where they roam con-
stantly in search of food. They can prove a great hazard to
swimmers and sailors, and are able to hear movement in the
water from over a mile away. Once blood is spilled, the
water will soon be full of hungry Sharks, hoping for an easy
kill. For every wound inflicted, either on a Shark or its oppo-
nent, there is a 1 in 6 chance that another will arrive and
attack the creature that was injured. Fighting underwater is
difficult, and will temporarily remove 2 points from a land-
dweller's Attack Strength. There is also the danger of drown-
ing. Unless an opponent can defeat the Shark(s) in less
rounds than his current SKILL, he will drown and become a
meal for the Sharks anyway.
Although Sharks are normally found in the sea, they may
also be encountered as part of a nasty trap in a dungeon or

tomb. They will be much the same as ocean-dwelling Sharks,
but in this case others will not be attracted by the smell of
spilled blood.
