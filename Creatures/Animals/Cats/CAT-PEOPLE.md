## Description

The CAT PEOPLE of central Allansia are a strange race of
primitive humanoids related to felines. Their heads are
cat-shaped, with human features offset by slanting green eyes,
long teeth and whiskers. They have paws instead of hands
and feet, which are equipped with sharp, retractable claws.
They are covered in a smooth pelt of short black fur. They are
very dextrous, and may sometimes be seen springing between
the branches of trees at twilight, on the trail of their prey. They
live on the small creatures they can catch, though they are not
afraid of taking on larger beings, even humans.
The origins of the Cat People are lost in the far distant past.
Their own legends, told to curious scholars in their strange
growling and mewing language, speak of a curse laid upon
a race of cats by a malevolent sorcerer, a curse that has forced
them to inhabit human bodies ever since. It is thought that
their race was more populous in earlier times; nowadays only
a handful of tribes remain, split into hundreds of small family
groups across the land. Their numbers are threatened even
more in recent times, for they are hunted for their pelts by
unscrupulous poachers.
