## Description

Pumas are large predatory cats found in mountainous and forested regions across Titan. They are solitary hunters, preying on deer, smaller mammals, and other creatures. Pumas are known for their agility and stealth, able to stalk their prey silently before launching a powerful attack. They typically avoid humans but will defend themselves or their territory if threatened.
