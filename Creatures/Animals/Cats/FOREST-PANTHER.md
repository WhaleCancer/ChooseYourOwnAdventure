## Description

The Forest Panther is found across southern Khul, from Kazan, where both it and the Fangtigers are the symbols of the city of Yigenik, to Hachiman, where it is known as the shako-gurubi. Forest Panthers are smaller than Black Panthers, and even Jaguars, and are often found hunting in pairs. Their pelts can be black, but also ash-grey and deep brown in colour. The mysterious beings known as the Necromancers of Kazan are known to transform into Forest Panthers at times, though their abilities will be several points higher than the combat scores given above. One ancient Hachiman legend holds that if you find yourself snared by a trap in the woods, and a Forest Panther approaches, your only choice is between hacking off your own leg to escape, or, flailing about with your weapon in the hope of driving the creature away. Confusing the matter is the fact that hyenas are known to imitate the snuffling roar of the Forest Panther, so one should always try to confirm the true identity of an approaching beast before commencing impromptu amputation!
