## Description

Jaguars are ferocious predatory cats found chiefly in the jungles of the south. They live on smaller creatures such as boar, monkeys and deer, though when they are hungry they will take on creatures much larger than themselves. They will attack any creature they believe is a threat to them – especially man. They are hunted extensively by the primitive jungle tribes for their marvellous pelts, and are very wary of all humanoids as a result. Sometimes, a Jaguar cub will be taken from its jungle home and reared and trained as a pet for someone rich enough to pay the exorbitant price. Like all the big cats, they are difficult to handle, and can never be truly domesticated. Kept fed with a lot of fresh meat and fit with a lot of exercise, though, they make excellent guards, though their loyalty is never as strong as a Dog's, and they have been known to turn on their masters at the slightest whim.
