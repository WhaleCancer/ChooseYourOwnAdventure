## Description

The Black Panther of southern Allansia is a formidable creature, as befits a beast thought to be an ancestor of the equally feared Black Lion. Unlike that great cat however, the Black Panther dwells exclusively within the jungles that border the Gulf of Shamuz, from Arantis to Silur Cha. Here, its night-black fur gives it excellent camouflage as it hunts forest deer and antelope in the shadows of the great trees that is its home. They are also venerated by the Panther Warriors of the Nightshriek Jungle who consider them incarnations of Sku-Rachi the Panther God, and whose priests are rumoured to be Werepanthers (with SKILL 10 STAMINA 10 in panther form).
