## Description

It is not known whether Black Lions are the result of a wizard's experiment or natural crossbreeding in the wild. What is certain, however, is that they are a cross between a black panther and a lion, a mix that makes them the most savage of all the hunting cats. These deadly predators are found where the grasses of hot plains meet the thick vegetation of jungles. They usually sleep all day, languishing in the crook of a branch high above the ground. Come twilight, they will descend from their lofty perch to hunt wild boar, deer and other nocturnal creatures. They can run, leap and climb well, and are consequently very dangerous to all creatures. Once a Black Lion is on the trail of its prey, there is little the hapless quarry can do to escape the beast's claws and teeth.

Some have tried to tame Black Lions, but with little success, for the creatures are as wild as enraged tigers. Occasionally, however, men have been able to separate some cubs from their mother, steal them and domesticate them for use as guards and pets. But Black Lions never remain loyal to any master for very long, and sooner or later turn on him and extract their revenge for their imprisonment.
