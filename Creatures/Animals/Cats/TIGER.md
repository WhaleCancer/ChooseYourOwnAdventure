## Description

Tigers are among the largest predatory cats on Titan: huge orange and black-striped felids related to Lions but living in wooded areas with plenty of undergrowth. Here, their colouration provides excellent camouflage while hunting deer, antelope, and other prey. Tigers are native to the southern jungles of Allansia, and in the Old World they can be found in the forested areas of the Anvils of the Gods, Far Analand, and the cloud forests of Mauristatia. On Khul, they live in Scorpion Swamp, for they are surprisingly water-loving for cats, to the jungles beyond Shurrupak, and the kingdom of Hachiman. Rare White Tigers are even known from the islands of the Arrowhead Archipelago. Tigers have long history on Titan. They fought on the side of Good, alongside Magir the Tiger Goddess during the First Battle, and it is said that a gigantic golden Tiger guards the accursed ruins of the lost city of Kharnek, somewhere in southern Allansia.

## Fangtiger

Looking like a cross between a normal Tiger and a Sabre-Toothed Tiger, but smaller than either of them, are the Fangtigers of south-western Khul. With their orange and black pelts, and the enormous curved fangs that give them their name, they are impressive beasts and much intertwined with the cultures of the small kingdoms of this area, such as Kazan, where they are the totem of the clan and city of Yigenik, and Zamarra. Indeed, Fangtigers can be domesticated to an extent and used as battle-mounts, typically reined in pairs, with their rider placing one foot on the back of each animal. Noted warriors who ride a pair of Fangtigers into battle include the notorious Beshbalik, leader of the Kazanid mercenaries known as Beshbalik's Marauders, and the commander of a group of renegade Amazons operating in the vicinity of the city-state of Zamarra.

## Snow Tiger

The Snow Tiger is a hunter of the northern Ice Wastes of Allansia, ranging as far south as the foothills of the Icefinger and Freezeblood Mountains. Although it has a grey-white pelt adorned with jagged black stripes, its long curved fangs and stub of a tail show that it is more closely related to the Sabre-Toothed Tiger of warmer southern lands. The Snow Tiger preys on deer and moose, tracking them tirelessly across the tundra, but it will resort to scavenging and eating carrion when times are hard. They are hunted by Frost Giants, Barbarians, and the Toa-Suo, and as a consequence are rare throughout their range.
