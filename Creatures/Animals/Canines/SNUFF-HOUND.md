## Description

Snuff Hounds are curious-looking creatures from Khul, used by nomadic tribes for tracking. They have low-slung distended bellies, white hairless skin, and a short, almost human-like face, except for its elongated nose that terminates in a snuffling, trumpet-shaped orifice. This elongated nose is the source of their name, as they are excellent trackers.

They are quite aggressive and will attack if not restrained, using their clawed forepaws as weapons because they lack a strong bite. They are expensive and usually kept leashed to prevent them from attacking more powerful foes.
