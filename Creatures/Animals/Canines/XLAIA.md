## Description

Also known as the Devil Dog, the XLAIA is a much-feared though extremely rare breed of canine monster with not one but two heads! Some foolish scholars even consider it to be extinct, though it patently is not. One, for example, draws the chariot of the Doom Demon, Prince of the Undead, while another was locked up in Baron Sukhumvit's nefarious Deathtrap Dungeon. Yet another was encountered in a Black Elf-controlled series of holy catacombs known as the Dungeon of Justice; this creature was even rumoured to have golden claws (worth 2-12 Gold Pieces) on its giant paws.

Regardless of their rarity, the Xlaia is a huge horrible dog-like creature, with a muscular body covered in short black fur. Beneath the red eyes on both heads are slavering jaws, from whose curling lips protrude savage yellow fangs, often still stained with the blood of previous victims.
