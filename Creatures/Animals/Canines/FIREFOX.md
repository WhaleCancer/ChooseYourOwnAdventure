## Description

Foxes are fairly common predators throughout northern
Allansia and Kakhabad. Most are content to leave men alone,
for they know they are no match for them. To the FIREFOX-
ES of the Forests of Snatta, however, an adventurer is just
like a boar or a chicken — food! These beasts are as large as
Wolves, covered in a rich fiery-red fur and with a magnifi-
cent brush of a tail. They are savage hunters, thinking only
of their next meal, which they can sniff out and track with
great cunning. Their strength, together with the sharpness of
their teeth and claws, is enough to cope with most prey.
Should a Firefox find itself losing a fight, it also has other
powers to draw upon.
If a Firefox is wounded at any time, in the next round it will
suddenly burst into flames and leap on its opponent. If its
attack is successful, it will burn them for 5 points of s STAM
INA damage; if not, the creature will be wounded as usual.
This 'flame on' is not without cost to the Firefox, for it will
lose 1 SKILL and 1 STAMINA point for the tremendous
energy it burns up. After its attack it will return to normal,
but every time it is wounded again it will attack in flames the
round after, until either the Firefox or its opponent is dead.
The fiery-red pelt of a Firefox is very valuable, especially to
sorcerers, for it is an essential ingredient in all manner of
fire-producing spells and potions.
