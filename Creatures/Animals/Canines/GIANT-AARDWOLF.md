## Description

Giant Aardwolves are found only on the warm southern plains, where they roam in small groups. Related to hyenas, they are about the size of a large Wolf, but much leaner. Their short coats are yellow-grey, with irregular black stripes that help them hide in the long grasses. They normally eat insects, but they will defend themselves when threatened by large creatures. If more than three are encountered, the others will be cubs (SKILL 4, STAMINA 3). The adults will be more vigilant and protective, and will attack to guard their young.
