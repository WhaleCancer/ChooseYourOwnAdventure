## Description

Easily  recognizable  by  its  long  green  fur, which serves to
camouflage  it  well  in  the  higher  branches  of  Pango Trees,
the  CHAMPAQUE  is a  beast  to  be avoided at all costs.   It
is a moderately intelligent creature, with a face like an ageing
sorcerer  and  long,  powerful  limbs.      The Champaque is a
voracious carnivore which spends much of its time well
hidden in the upper branches of its favourite tree, watching
for prospective prey. It is a solitary creature and has the
uncanny ability to mimic the voices of any animal it studies.
Having such a close resemblance to humans, it can not only
imitate a human voice, but can also mimic human
mannerisms. For those who have never come across a
Champaque before, it at first appears to be a curious hybrid
of man and ape.
Its behaviour will be friendly, as it attempts to catch its victim
off guard by continuing a conversation (but never giving
much information away), until it seizes its chance to attack.
The purpose of its attack is always for food and it will drag
its victim away as quickly as possible into the undergrowth
where it will feast on the warm brain. After having eaten, the
beast becomes even more dangerous. For the Champaque has
the ability to digest parts of its victim's brain intact, thus
absorbing some of the intelligence of its hapless prey. For each
gruesome meal that a Champaque has eaten within the
previous twenty-four hours, its SKILL increases by 1 point
up to a maximum of 5, when it will be full. Thus a fully fed
Champaque will be SKILL 12, STAMINA 10. The only advice
that can be offered to adventurers who come across a
Champaque is simple: it must be killed immediately!
