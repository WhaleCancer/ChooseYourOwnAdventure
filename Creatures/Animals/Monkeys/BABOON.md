## Description

BABOONS are some of the largest monkeys on Titan, growing to be almost as big as a man. They dwell in a variety of habitats from hilly desert uplands to steamy tropical jungles. Baboons are covered in bristly fur ranging from yellow through brown to grey in colour, and their dog-like muzzles contain vicious-looking sharp teeth. They eat anything they can get their clawed hands on, including fruit and tubers, but they prefer fresh meat where possible.

Baboons are intelligent, troop-dwelling social creatures, communicating with each other in a language of grunts and yelps, which become screams, snarls and howls when confronted with an enemy. They have been known to hurl rocks as missile weapons and set ambushes for lone travellers that they consider easy prey.

If six or more Baboons are encountered, one of them will be a **GREAT BABOON** with SKILL 8 STAMINA 7, which is the largest and most dominant male. The ancient Djaratians of Irritaria were known to venerate the Baboon as sacred, and there is a legend of a ruined city in southern Arantis populated by these creatures, ruled by a king.
