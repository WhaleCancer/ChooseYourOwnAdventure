Thought to be related to Sewer Snakes, the CESUOSHE is
a gargantuan serpent with a mottled brown scaly hide that
grows up to thirty metres long! It is found only in natural
caverns, and the catacombs and sewers that tunnel
beneath the cities of exotic southern lands such as
Hachiman, the Isles of the Dawn and the shores of the
Inland Sea. Typically, the Cesuoshe will lie patiently
within a tunnel, with its mouth wide open and waiting
for prey to literally walk straight down its throat.
Anything that puts up a fight will be subdued by the
thrashing coils of the creature’s purple tongue, which is
both thick and muscular as well as exuding an acidic slime
through its pores. Should its tongue be hacked apart, the
Cesuoshe will close its mouth and flee deeper
underground, waiting for its tongue to regenerate.
However, if the creature is encountered in a large cavern
or chamber where it can attack normally, it will rise up
and strike its enemies with its great fanged jaws. Anyone
hit twice in succession by a Cesuoshe will be swallowed
by the serpent and dissolved in the powerful digestive
juices of its gullet. Rumours abound that Baron Sukhumvit
of Fang once tried to capture a Cesuoshe for his infamous
Deathtrap Dungeon. Unfortunately it died once the
galleon transporting it ventured into colder northern
waters. Only parts of the tongue of the great beast could

be saved, and this was duly resurrected by the grand
wizard Lexus of Blacksand, who implanted it inside the
mouth of a carven stone face, deep within the dungeon.
