## Description

The FELINAURS of the eastern plains are similar to Cen-
taurs, but whereas the latter are man and horse combined,
these creatures are part man and part lion. From the waist
upwards, a Felinaur looks much like a normal person,
though with a golden-brown, heavily tanned skin and an
unkempt mane-like mass of darker brown hair flowing
down its back. From the waist downwards, they have the
strong, lithe bodies of lions, coloured a sandy golden-brown
like their upper halves.
Packs of Felinaurs may be found roaming wide areas of
warm grassland, hunting deer and antelope just like their
leonine forebears, though using radically more advanced
methods! They are expert with bow and javelin, being able to
hit a fleeing antelope while galloping along behind it. They
also usually carry a shortsword in a scabbard strapped
across their backs, next to their quiver. The creatures live in
small family groups, clustered together in their own patch of
grassland. Both males and females hunt for food, except
when the latter have young to rear. Each Felinaur family is
part of an extended tribe, ruled over by the strongest male,
elected each season after many mock battles and tourna-
ments. It is he who decides which areas to hunt in during the
next season, and also has the duty of sacrificing the tribe's
first prey of each year to the great Lion God Kurawu, of
whom the Felinaurs believe themselves to be the sin-defiled
offspring.
Young Felinaurs are very similar to their parents, except that
their hindquarters are lightly mottled with spots of darker
brown. Felinaurs speak their own language, and also that of
lions, with whom they occasionally converse.
