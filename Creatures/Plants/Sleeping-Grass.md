## Description

SLEEPING GRASS is not an actively carnivorous plant, but
it can nevertheless greatly affect anyone encountering it. It is
a fiery-red colour (a large patch of it gives Firetop Mountain
its name), and produces many small flowers among its
blades. The flowers emit a very sweet smell when disturbed,
and fill the air with a cloud of pollen. Anyone who disturbs
the grass will suddenly feel very relaxed and tired, and will
stop to sit among the flowers and rest. He will feel his eyelids
growing heavy, and then fall into a deep sleep full of vivid
dreams for several hours. Predators sometimes wait near
patches of Sleeping Grass, knowing that there is a chance of
some easy prey. Unless they are very quick in dragging their
victim off the patch, though, they will fall asleep themselves.
It can be truly alarming to wake up surrounded by a pack of
lions, Ores and Snattacats, all fast asleep!
