## Description

Each jaw - 5
Body -10
Deep in the heart of the most forgotten parts of the eastern
jungles, everything appears to have mutated. In their lush
surroundings, exotic plants have grown huge, evolving
gradually into specimens many times their normal size. The
GIANT VENUS FLY-TRAP is very much like a standard
plant, but much, much larger. They often lie close to clumps
of fragrant flowers or well-used pools, where they can count
on a regular supply of fresh meat.
The plant consists of a thick trunk-like body about seven
metres tall, from which two to seven (1 die plus 1) tendrils
sprout and lie scattered around its base. At the end of each
tendril, lying hidden among the undergrowth, is an im-
mense jaw-like leaf. Any creature, man-sized or less, coming
close to one of these must successfully Test for Luck, or be
caught as the jaws snap shut; this will do 3 points of STAMI-
NA damage. Once inside the jaws, which will have locked so
tightly they cannot be prised open, a creature's only hope of
escape is to attack the fleshy insides with claws or a short
dagger. Unless the victim kills the particular jaw, he will
quickly die from the plant's powerful digestive acids.
Any attack on the outside of a jaw can be delivered automat-
ically, but will deliver the damage equally to the jaw and its
captive (hence, for a captive to be freed, he must lose 5
STAMINA points). Should the main body of the plant be
killed, however, the jaws will go limp and release any cap-
tives they contain. Striking at the body may be difficult, if
there are still jaws open and ready to attack. The remains of
past victims may be found scattered among the tangled
creepers that surround the plant, and there may well be
metal treasures that will have been dropped from the jaws,
as they are indigestible.
