## Description

Forests don't just 'grow': they have to be tended and cared for
if they are to survive to become strong and tall with trees.
The Elves, forest-dwellers themselves, have long known this,
but men have only recently encountered the gardeners of the
forests – the TREE MEN.
At first sight, they are all but indistinguishable from the trees
that surround them. They have tall trunks, with two large
branches that they use as arms, surrounded by smaller ones.
Hidden in their thick, cracked bark are a mouth and a pair of
small, incredibly ancient eyes. The Tree Men move slowly
among their trees on large splayed roots. They are very
protective of their trees, and may attack anyone harming
them, or even just trespassing in the forest. In an attack they
will flay about with their two main branches. Each branch
can attack separately and has 8 STAMINA points. The Tree
Man itself will prove far too strong to kill, but disabling both
of its arms will cause it to retreat, severely injured. Just like
trees, the strange humanoids are very vulnerable to fire, and
they will concentrate all their efforts on putting it out, allow-
ing their opponents to escape their clutches.
