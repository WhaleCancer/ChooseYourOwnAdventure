## Description

TANGLEWEED, also known as Bloodgrass or Devil's
Tongue, is a strange type of blood-sucking grass found in
isolated places, often intermingled with more normal plants.
It grows to almost a metre in height and is difficult to distin-
guish from the other grasses it grows alongside. Unlike its
fellow species, however, it can control the movements of the
long, blade-like leaves which it uses to catch its food. The
weird plants live by entangling small animals in their leaves
and sucking their blood through hundreds of tiny needle-
like hairs. They are not averse to attacking larger creatures
either, though a particular clump can only do a maximum of
3 points of damage before it is full up.
The leaves will usually surround their prey before the latter
is aware that anything is wrong, and so the damage is auto-
matic. If other clumps are near enough, however, they will
join in the feast and may be fought as normal; if the Tangle-
weed wins, it will latch on and drink its fill, for 3 points of
damage. Once it has drunk as much as it can, the plant will
loosen its hold and sink limply to the ground, its leaves a
dull red colour. Fire brandished threateningly at a plant will
keep it away (it is too moist to be burnt successfully), but
while one plant is shrinking from the flames others may be
gently approaching behind their prey, ready for their next
meal of
