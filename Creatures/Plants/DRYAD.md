## Description

DRYAD
       Handmaiden  Queen
 
 
    0 (see below)
 
Whereas Wood Elves and Fairies are children of the plant
goddess Galana, DRYADS are true spirits of the trees,
tasked to protect the woods and forests from the ravages
of more war-like races. The most common form of Dryad
46       DRAGONMAN

are called HANDMAIDENS, and appear as tall young
women or female Elves, with dark brown skin, green hair,
and clothing made entirely of leaves. If ten or more Dryads
are encountered, one will be a Queen; very tall and thin,
with wrinkled brown skin, brown hair, and festooned in
simple clothes made from brown leaves. They live deep
within the oldest of forests, in enchanted glades guarded
by watch-posts accessible only via magical rope-ladders.
If an intruder chances upon such a place, the Dryads will
wordlessly gesture for them to leave; those that do not
will be attacked by the Handmaidens.
The DRYAD QUEEN however, has no knowledge of
combat, and will offer no resistance to being attacked. She
will be defended though by the guardian tree that forms
her guard-post: at the end of every Attack Round, roll a
die, and on a 6 the branches of her guardian tree have
grabbed her assailants and torn them apart! Should the
Dryad Queen be slain, her tree will also fall still, although
this is only a temporary setback and she will soon
regenerate. The only way to slay the Dryads is to set fire
to their entire garden but this is of course a reprehensibly
evil act. Instead, Dryads often aid those who help them
rebuild their gardens and replant their woods, providing
gifts such as thorn-swords crafted entirely from wood and
the like. Anyone so helping the Dryads must abandon
their weapons at the entrance of the garden, for the
tree-spirits hate metal with a vengeance and seek to
destroy it wherever possible.  Dryad Queens are even
known to weave simple magical charms that cause all
metal in the vicinity to rust instantly, consuming weapons,
gold coins, and even magical rings and charms. Truly
these deceptively delicate and graceful tree-spirits should
be approached carefully and with great respect!
