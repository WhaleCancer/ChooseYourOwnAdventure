## Description

Standing almost three metres tall, the GIANT PITCHER-
PLANT looks very much like an enormous vase, covered in
vines and creepers. Like many other plants around it in the

depths of the jungle, it has evolved to many times the size of
normal pitcher-plants. These particular plants are quite rare,
but can prove a hazard to anyone exploring deep in the jungle.
Pitcher-Plants are carnivorous, living off any large creature
they can capture. A strong, whiplike tendril, almost seven
metres long, extends from the lip of the vase. Should any
creature disturb the sensitive carpet of vines around the vase's
base, the tendril will attack. If it scores a successful hit, it will
wrap itself around the target and lift it into the vase to be
digested. Unless the victim can finish off the tendril in the
very next strike, he will find himself down inside the plant,
in a metre of stagnant rainwater.
The inside of the plant is covered with sharp spines to prevent
anything climbing out again. Should a creature try to escape,
it will suffer 15 points of STAMINA damage before reaching
the lip. Once the plant has deposited its food into the vase, it
will secrete digestive acids into the water that will do 1 point
of damage every minute until the food is dissolved. These
acids are not strong enough to harm most metals, so the inside
of a vase may contain quite a hoard of treasure. The inside
walls of the plant are toughened, to withstand the acid, and
cannot be damaged. Anyone attacking the outside, however,
can free a victim once the body of the plant has been killed.
Hits on the vase are automatic, but only if the tendril has been
destroyed. Every three blows will take one minute; once the
vase is destroyed, the acid will flow away, and the victim can
be rescued – if he is still alive!
