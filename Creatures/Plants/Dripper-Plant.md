## Description

The DRIPPER PLANT (or Death Dripper, as [forest lore](../../../../RULES/Skills/MENTAL/Outdoorsman/Forest-Lore.md) sometimes has it) is a very strange carnivorous shrub, which ensnares its food with deadly poison. Standing about three metres tall, the plant has a wide, thick-barked trunk, which only branches into palm-like fronds at the top. Scattered among the leaves are star-shaped yellow flowers which bloom all year round. These flowers hang out over the mat of spindly roots that gather around the base of the plant.

Should any creature disturb these roots, the flowers will release a glutinous, honey-like poison. The fluid will hit its intended victims unless they Test for Luck successfully. Otherwise, the fast-acting contact poison will kill them within a few agonizing moments. A victim's body will be encircled by the roots, which break up the plant's food so that it can decompose and be ingested quickly.

Dripper Plants can sometimes be spotted by tell-tale piles of metal items gathered around their bases; many a victim has been caught in a shower of deadly poison while trying to recover treasure from among the hair-trigger roots. It is thought that Dripper Plants may be somehow related to [Stranglebush](./STRANGLEBUSH.md), another carnivorous trapper plant.
