## Description

STRANGLE WEED occurs in many overgrown areas, but it
is most commonly found hidden among the dense thickets at
the heart of Darkwood Forest. Although it looks much like
the trees that surround it, it is in fact a large, vine-like creep-
er, and a most voracious one at that.
The main body of the plant grows up to four metres high,
and can easily be mistaken for a real tree-trunk, with its
rough, bark-like surface. From around the top of this thick
stem as many as fifty thin tendrils droop to the ground. The
Strangle Weed uses them as a fisherman would, to trap the
small creatures it usually lives off.
Each tendril is about six metres long, and ends in a cluster of
bright, pungent-smelling flowers. When an unsuspecting
creature stops to nibble, or disturbs the tendrils in any way,
the rest of the creepers lash around it. Squeezing with prodi-
gious strength, they choke the prey to death, and then raise
it to the top of the stem and squash its juices out into a
shallow hollow, where they are slowly digested over the
next few hours.
Strangle Weed isn't averse to snatching at anything that
disturbs its creepers, and that includes humans! If an unwary
adventurer should activate the tendrils, they will immediate-
ly whip around him.
While he may make the normal attack, the Strangle Weed
will also automatically strangle 1 point of his STAMINA
every round. If the adventurer dies, it will raise the corpse
up, and slowly crush his flesh and extract his juices, leaving
the skeleton hanging high above the ground. It can be very
disconcerting to take a stroll through the forest and stumble
on such horrific aerial graveyards!
