## Description

At the heart of the Forest of Snatta in northern Kakhabad, the
STRANGLEBUSHES grow, feeding off the creatures they
catch in their long, tentacle-like branches. Similar in many
ways to Tangle-weed, they can control their branches, using
them to entwine around limbs and drag their prey into the
heart of the bush where their bodies will be absorbed. The
strange plant will attack as normal, but its attempts will not
appear to be doing any damage. Instead, it will just tighten
its grip a little more. If its opponent has not escaped the
clutches of the Stranglebush after five Attack Rounds, he will
be completely immobilized and can only wait to be choked
to death by the plant before his juices are squeezed out of him.
