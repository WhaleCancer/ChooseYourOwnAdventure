## Description

The WODEWOSE, or Green Men, are strange

creatures – primal spirits of the forest itself. They

appear as plant-like people, clothed entirely in

leaves, moss, bark, bracken and fungus, though

these are not their clothes but their actual physical

form. Wodewose can be male or female, and the

la;er often have long green hair plaited with ivy

and other plants. So well are they disguised and

camouflaged that Wodewose will always surprise

whoever

they

encounter.

What

though depends on what this person will do. If they
