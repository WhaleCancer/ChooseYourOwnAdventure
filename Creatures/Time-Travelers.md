# Time Travelers

**Type:** Human / Future refugees  
**Origin:** Far future (post-nuclear war)  
**Era:** Present in 1985

## Overview

**Time Travelers** are women sent into the past (specifically the 1980s) to seduce healthy men and become pregnant. The women then return to the far future to repopulate the Earth. This is because in the future, nuclear fallout has rendered humans unable to reproduce.

## The Future

Their world was destroyed by a nuclear war initiated by defense computers. This war also resulted in the cataclysmic destruction of the [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Elohim]] in a final, devastating conflict. Most of the current population is in poor health, but the time travelers—all women—are relatively healthy and are given the best food and care to pass for 20th-century humans.

## Physical Adaptations

- **Present-day air is too clean** for the time travelers to process; they smoke cigarettes to mimic their own timeline's atmosphere.
- They appear healthy and well-cared-for, standing out from the general population of their time.
- They may exhibit subtle signs of being from a different era or environment.

## Mission

- Travel to the 1980s
- Seduce healthy men
- Become pregnant
- Return to the far future with the children
- Repopulate Earth with healthy offspring

## In Play

Time Travelers serve as:

- **Mystery elements** - Women with strange behaviors and knowledge
- **Plot devices** - Their presence may indicate temporal anomalies
- **Investigation hooks** - Why are these women so healthy? Why do they smoke constantly?
- **Temporal paradox elements** - Their actions may have unforeseen consequences
- **Connection to other phenomena** - May be related to thin veil events or other supernatural phenomena

### Game Considerations

- Time Travelers should be mysterious and potentially tragic figures
- Their mission is desperate but necessary for their timeline
- They may be confused or disoriented by 1980s culture
- Their presence may attract unwanted attention from various factions
- The children they bear may have unusual characteristics
