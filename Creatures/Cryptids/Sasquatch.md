# Sasquatch

**Type:** Cryptid / Genetically engineered creature  
**Territory:** Great Bear Rainforest, British Columbia (primary population center)  
**Era:** Present since ancient times, increased encounters in 1985

## Overview

Sasquatch (also known as Bigfoot) is another creature on the planet that defends its home, only turning violent when encroached upon. In truth, Sasquatch was actually genetically engineered and released by Visitors (Greys) a long time ago.

**This is the era of encroachment** - as logging and development expand into the Great Bear Rainforest, Sasquatch encounters are becoming more frequent and more dangerous.

The Great Bear Rainforest serves as the center of the sasquatch population, and the political struggle to protect it is also a struggle to protect the sasquatch.

## Physiology

Sasquatch are large, bipedal hominids standing 7-9 feet tall, covered in thick fur ranging from dark brown to reddish-brown. They possess immense strength and are capable of moving silently through dense forest terrain.

## Behavior

Sasquatch are territorial creatures that defend their homes. They only turn violent when their territory is encroached upon by:

- Logging equipment and operations
- Campers and hikers in remote areas
- Development and infrastructure projects
- Hunters and poachers

### Encounter Progression

#### First Encounter: Evidence Only

The first encounter with Sasquatch will only be with evidence of their existence:

- **Footprints** - Large, human-like tracks that need to be cast and analyzed
- **Hair samples** - Collected from tree branches and other surfaces
- **Knocking sounds** - When Sasquatch knock rocks against wood (distinctive audio pattern)

Players must investigate these signs, gathering evidence before any direct contact.

#### Second Encounter: Relocation

The second encounter with Sasquatch will be with a single individual who is coming too close to human habitation (maybe a small town like Prince Rupert). The agents will have to:

- Tranquilize the Sasquatch
- Relocate it to join the rest of its family
- This introduces the concept of Sasquatch families/packs

This encounter may also include a **Bigfoot hunter** (UFO fanatic, conspiracy theorist, or parallel civilian investigator) who is trying to catch Sasquatch. The agents don't want that - they want to protect the creature and relocate it safely.

#### Third Encounter: Fence Cocker (Malicious Sasquatch)

The third encounter with Sasquatch will be with a "fence cocker" - a Sasquatch that is explicitly malicious and is probably attacking:

- Campers
- Hikers
- Loggers
- Similar people in the wild

This Sasquatch may have access to a specific magical item like a **Bigfoot skull** (a cursed item). The Bigfoot hunter from the second encounter might cooperate with the agents, but may not understand that the Sasquatch has access to this cursed item.

## NPC: Grant Hadwin

**Grant Hadwin** is an eco-terrorist who plays himself. He may be involved in Sasquatch-related scenarios, particularly those involving logging and environmental protection.

## Relationship with Other Elements

- **Logging Industry:** Sasquatch encounters increase as logging encroaches on their territory
- **Environmental Protection:** The struggle to protect the Great Bear Rainforest is also a struggle to protect Sasquatch
- **Greys/Visitors:** Sasquatch were created by the Visitors, creating a connection to alien genetic engineering
- **Magical Items:** Some Sasquatch may have access to cursed items like Bigfoot skulls

## In Play

Sasquatch encounters provide opportunities for:

- **Environmental themes** - Protection of wilderness and native species
- **Investigation scenarios** - Gathering evidence and understanding the creatures
- **Moral choices** - Balancing human safety with creature protection
- **Action sequences** - Tranquilizing and relocating creatures, or dealing with aggressive individuals
- **Conspiracy elements** - The connection to Grey genetic engineering

### Game Considerations

- Sasquatch encounters should progress from mysterious evidence to direct contact to dangerous situations
- The connection to Grey genetic engineering adds a science-fiction element to a classic cryptid
- The environmental protection angle ties into 1985 British Columbia's logging industry
- The cursed items and Bigfoot hunter elements add supernatural and conspiracy layers
