# Lake Monster (Ogopogo / Water Orm)

**Type:** Cryptid / Aquatic creature  
**Territory:** Inland lakes throughout British Columbia (primarily Okanagan Lake)  
**Era:** Present since ancient times, protected by law in 1985

## Overview

**Lake Monsters** (also called "Water Orms") are elusive water creatures that populate lakes throughout British Columbia. The Outsiders populate lakes with these for inscrutable reasons.

The most famous example in British Columbia is **Ogopogo** of Okanagan Lake, which has been granted legal protection under the Wildlife Act.

## Physical Description

"Water orm"—or the far more general "lake monster"—is a title given to a host of freshwater beasts that conform to a similar type and behavior. They are almost always huge, extremely long-lived monsters that dwell in lakes, but they may have a number of physical variations. Many water orms resemble large serpents or snake-necked dinosaurs, similar in appearance to sea serpents or linnorms, with which they share a common ancestry.

## Behavior

Water orms' considerable lifespans and ability to seemingly vanish when in danger make them almost seem to be features of the lake they inhabit, rather than mere animals. Nearby land-dwellers propagate the lore of water orms to legendary status. From commoners to nobles, people from all over the land might journey to a given body of water if only to catch a glimpse of these massive yet subtle creatures.

Many claim to have seen one, and nearly every sailor has heard tell of one, but few people ever actually encounter this most elusive magical beast.

## Ogopogo (Okanagan Lake)

**Okanagan Lake** is home to the most well-documented and legally protected lake monster in British Columbia.

See [Ogopogo: The Lake Serpent](./Creatures/Cryptids/Ogopogo-Statblock.md) for detailed information, abilities, and adventure hooks.

### Legal Protection

**Bruce Strachan**, Minister of Environment (Social Credit), wrote an amendment protecting "A vertebrate, over three meters in length, resident in Lake Okanagan and which is not a White Sturgeon." It worked—they got it by legislative counsel and into the Wildlife Act.

The population in Okanagan Lake is well managed, though wild ogopogo exist throughout the province.

### Cryptid Management

**Jim Walker**, Deputy Assistant Minister of Environment (in charge of Cryptids), oversees the management of cryptid populations including Ogopogo.

## Relationship with Other Elements

- **Outsiders:** The Outsiders populate lakes with these creatures for inscrutable reasons
- **Government:** The Wildlife Act provides legal protection for Ogopogo
- **Tourism:** Lake monsters attract visitors hoping to catch a glimpse
- **Local Legends:** Each lake with a monster develops its own folklore and traditions

## In Play

Lake monsters can serve as:

- **Investigation targets** - Cases involving sightings, attacks, or strange occurrences on lakes
- **Environmental themes** - Protection of cryptid populations and their habitats
- **Mystery elements** - Unexplained phenomena that may connect to larger conspiracies
- **Local color** - Regional flavor and local legends
- **Action scenarios** - Encounters on or near water

### Game Considerations

- Lake monsters are elusive and rarely seen directly
- The legal protection of Ogopogo adds a unique 1985 British Columbia element
- The connection to Outsiders suggests larger cosmic forces at work
- Encounters should feel mysterious and potentially dangerous
- The X-Files episode "Quagmire" provides inspiration for lake monster scenarios
