## Description

Angarocs are long serpent-like Demons serving the "Snake Demon Sith," existing in the Demonic Plane and dream worlds, occasionally summoned to Titan, and sometimes kept as pets by other Demon princes. They have a "snake-like" basic shape but with "legs at regular intervals along its body," which are "incredibly strong" allowing them to "scuttle along the ground or leap surprising distances."

## Special Abilities

- **Life Drain:** The very presence of an Angaroc is enough to drain the life force of nearby mortals. All enemies within 10' of this Demon must roll 2D6 every round. On a result of 2-7, the victim will lose 2 STAMINA. On a roll of 8-12, there is no loss. This power cannot be switched off.
- **Pounce and Smother:** Although the Angaroc has little in the way of natural weapons, its many legs do allow it to leap up to 20' and pounce on enemies. On a successful "hit" in combat, the target is smothered by the Angaroc. The target cannot move and suffers a -2 penalty to all tests until free. If a full round is spent wriggling free (requiring a successful SKILL test), the target may again act normally.
