## Description

The SOUL STEALER is a creature born from the

hellish depths of the Pit, its sole purpose being to

consume the souls from living beings. In taking

another’s life this foul beast not only absorbs the

victim’s soul, but also inherits his skills. From the

waist up the Soul Stealer resembles a decaying

human body; except that it has no mouth, and its

fingers are tipped with suckers which it fixes to its

victim and through which it drains life forces. The

lower part of its body is a serpent’s tail. Some very

powerful Soul Stealers have hypnotic powers: an

adventurer must Test their Luck and, if Unlucky,

they are mesmerized by the creature and it at its

mercy.

During combat, STAMINA is deducted normally from

whomever is wounded, but with every two A;ack

Rounds of combat lost by an adventurer, 1 point of

their SKILL is transferred from him to the Soul

Stealer, which thus become progressively tougher
