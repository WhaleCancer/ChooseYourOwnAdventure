## Description

These strange creatures are formed from a solid accumulation of vapour and are often found naturally in mist-shrouded forests, screaming and swooping. They seem to be able to find their way from the Demonic plane to Titan on their own, but only under certain circumstances. Fog Devils have a muscular man-like upper body with a twisted parody of a human face. Their lower bodies are mere trails of vapour that fade away at the edges into nothingness.

## Special Abilities

- When attacking an enemy, a Fog Devil will swirl around and around their target, causing confusion and uncertainty. The target will suffer a -2 penalty to their Attack Total whilst under attack.
- A Fog Devil moves by flying, although they cannot generally get more than 20 feet or so off the ground.
