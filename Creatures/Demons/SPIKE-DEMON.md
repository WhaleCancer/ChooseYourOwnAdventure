## Description

Spike Demons are used as shock troops by Demon Princes, occasionally summoned to Titan to cause havoc, and are fast, strong, and lethal in combat. They are a 10-foot tall ape-like creature, green-furred with warts, bright yellow eyes, fangs, claws, and a single spike on top of their head.

## Special Abilities

- The Spike Demon has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Spike Demon may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- These Demons are strong and have a +1 bonus to damage rolls made in hand to hand combat.
- Spike Demons are so fast that enemies cannot escape from combat with them.
