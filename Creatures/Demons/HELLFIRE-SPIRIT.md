## Description

These demons are brought from the Demonic plane to inhabit the bodies of "poor unfortunates," animating them to cause havoc. They are generally summoned for this task but sometimes find their own way. A Hellfire Spirit takes the form of whatever nearby corpse it manifested in. "Dancing flames can often be seen in their eyes to the careful observer."

## Special Abilities

- The Hellfire Spirit may, by taking a full round, conjure a flaming nine-tailed whip to their hand. This weapon counts as a morning star but without the associated attack penalty. It fades if picked up by another being. A Hellfire Spirit may only have one such whip in existence at a time.
- Every Hellfire Spirit knows one innate wizardry spell that they can cast at will. When this form first manifests, one of: Darkness, Ignite, Wall, Fire Bolt, Fly or Explode should be chosen. Using this spell takes a full round but does not require a roll.
- The Hellfire Spirit has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies at the same time. The Hellfire Spirit may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
