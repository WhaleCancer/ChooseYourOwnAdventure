## Description

The ACCURSED are undying guardians used as sentinels by the Demon Princes to watch over their prized possessions that remain hidden in forgotten shrines across Titan, and are similar to the much-feared Ishkarim. However, while the latter are part humanoid and part spider, the Accursed have the upper bodies of men and the lower bodies of gigantic scorpions! They will attack all intruders with polearms and their claw-like pincers.

If an Accursed hits an opponent in combat, roll one die. On a roll of 1 or 2, their victim is wounded by the demon's claws; on a 3 or 4 they are wounded by the polearm; and on a 5 or 6 they have been struck by the poison sting at the end of the Accursed's long segmented tail. Each successful hit from the poison sting causes 4 STAMINA points damage.

These demons are so big that in the cramped confines of the dungeons in which they are often found, they can only attack one at a time. The Accursed are known from the Desert of Skulls, where the ancient civilization of Djarat was thought to have summoned them at the behest of Rikat the Scorpion God, to serve as tomb guardians for all eternity.
