## Description

Horned Demons, also known as Yachar, are creatures drawn to Titan on "dark and stormy nights" to collect souls. They are rarely summoned, considered "too foul even for hardened Demonologists." They appear as a walking human corpse, clad in mildewed clothes and with the rotting but animate head of a horned ram on each shoulder. Their "eyes glow dark red" and they "lurch when they walk."

## Special Abilities

- A Horned Demon can fly using magic, although they cannot reach any great elevation or fly with any great speed. If they can swoop down on an enemy undetected, they can slash at the throat of a target, who has a -3 penalty to their Attack total for that round.
- The appearance of a Horned Demon is so disgusting that someone seeing one for the first time will immediately lose 2 points of STAMINA.
- A Horned Demon can use the Darkness spell (AFF2e p73) at will, although using it takes a full round.
