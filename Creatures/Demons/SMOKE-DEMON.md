## Description

Smoke Demons are popular summonings for evil wizards, used as assassins and champions, but rarely as guards due to their bad smell. They appear very much like a human fatally burnt in a fire, charred and blackened, surrounded by a miasma of smoke and foul smells (brimstone, burned flesh, and soot mixed together).

## Special Abilities

- The foul-smelling smoke constantly surrounding a Smoke Demon means that all non-Demons in the near vicinity suffer a -1 penalty to tests, including combat and spellcasting.
- The Smoke Demon has two Attacks and can fight two enemies simultaneously, but may only attack an individual enemy once per round.
