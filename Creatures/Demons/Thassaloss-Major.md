## Description

These demons are similar to their lesser (Type IV) brethren but require more power to summon. They are also used as guards by evil wizards. They have the same shape and appearance as the Lesser version but are up to ten feet tall.

## Special Abilities

- The Major Thassaloss has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Major Thassaloss may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- Attacks made against a Thassaloss with edged or pointed weapons have a -2 modifier to the damage roll. Blunt weapons do normal damage.
- The Thassaloss can shoot a green Cold Ray from its eyes during combat. This ray hits on a 1-5 on a D6 and inflicts one point of STAMINA damage, ignoring armour.
