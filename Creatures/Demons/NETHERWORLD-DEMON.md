## Description

The Netherworld Demon is a powerful, risky summoning, eight feet tall, roughly humanoid, covered in patchy black hair, with cloven hooves and a bull's head. Its nostrils and mouth leak flames and smoke, and it smells of brimstone.

## Special Abilities

- A +1 bonus to damage rolls in hand-to-hand combat.
- Two attacks, able to fight two enemies simultaneously, but only attacking an individual enemy once per round.
- A -2 penalty on damage rolls from non-magical weapons. Spells cannot inflict more than 4 points of damage (after armour).
- Can breathe fire every combat round, causing 1-3 STAMINA damage automatically, ignoring armour.
- Can take on a human form (takes a full round to change), but damage in human form causes involuntary reversion.
