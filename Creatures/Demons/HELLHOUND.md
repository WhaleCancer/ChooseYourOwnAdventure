## Description

These are huge dog-like Demons, at least 4' tall, heavily built, bad-tempered, aggressive, and popular for conjurers, used by Demon Princes for the Wild Hunt. They are pitch black with black teeth and tongue and glowing red eyes. They smoke gently and smell of sulphur and brimstone, and prefer a "direct fast dash" over stealth.

## Special Abilities

- The Hellhound has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Hellhound may only attack an individual enemy once in a round.
- The Hellhound may breathe fire at any enemy within 10' each round in addition to its normal attacks. This breath hits on a 1-2 on a D6 and causes 1 STAMINA point of damage. Armour does not apply.
- The powerful jaws of the Hellhound allow it to add +1 to damage rolls made.
