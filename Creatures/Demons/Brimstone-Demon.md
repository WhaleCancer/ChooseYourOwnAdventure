## Description

The BRIMSTONE DEMON is a classic example of the rank-and-file Lesser Demons that make up the majority of the Tertius Tier in the hierarchy of the Demonic Pit. Powerful but not especially intelligent, it is typically summoned to Titan by demonologists keen on using its strength and forcefulness to make a point, rather than participating in complex schemes.

The Brimstone Demon is a monstrous creature, covered in green scales, with fang-filled jaws and curved talons. It has a mighty and muscular torso and arms, and evil red eyes set deep within its skull. Sulphurous steam rises from its mouth, reeking of the sharp, acrid smell of brimstone, which gives it its name.

**Combat Effect:** Anyone fighting a Brimstone Demon must reduce their Attack Strength by 1 point due to the sulphur-stench.
