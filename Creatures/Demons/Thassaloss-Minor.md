## Description

These demons are summoned by Demonologists to serve as guards or sentries, commanded to attack anyone other than their summoner. They typically appear holding a black scythe (polearm) for attacking victims. They are animated human skeletons with four arms, a yellowed and aged appearance, and glowing green eye sockets.

## Special Abilities

- The Minor Thassaloss has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Minor Thassaloss may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- Attacks made against a Thassaloss with edged or pointed weapons have a -2 modifier to the damage roll. Blunt weapons do normal damage.
- The Thassaloss can shoot a green Cold Ray from its eyes during combat. This ray hits on a 1-3 on a D6 and inflicts one point of STAMINA damage, ignoring armour.
