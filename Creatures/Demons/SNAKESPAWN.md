## Description

The u;erly vile Demon Princes who rule over the

Infernal Abyss are a vindictive bunch who rarely

fight fair. If one of their more important servants on

the Earthly Plane is unfortunately killed by some

brave adventurer out righting wrongs, they don’t

just tear up their plans and throw them on the

demonic equivalent of a refuse pile. Instead, they

become violently vengeful, demand that ‘justice’ be

done, and send forth a SNAKESPAWN.

These grisly beings are horrific in appearance,

having a snake’s body and tail, and a four-armed

human

upper

half,

and

typically

carrying

a

terrifying array of spiked or jagged-edged weapons.
