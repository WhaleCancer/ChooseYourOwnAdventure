## Description

These Demons are heavily infused with chaos, making each one unique. Their base form is a man-sized humanoid with scaly skin and a short tail. However, every Chaos Demon has more than one mutation, such as crab claws, multiple eyes, extra limbs, or heads. They are used as shock troops in demonic legions or sent to Titan to cause chaos. Their physical forms and minds are unstable; they are described as unhinged and unpredictable.

## Special Abilities

This Demon form has two Mutations that should be rolled on the table in Chapter 1. Each time a Demon reforms in this form, the mutations should be rolled afresh.
