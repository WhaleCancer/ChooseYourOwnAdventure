## Description

These are demonic assassins who leave a trail of letters (D-E-A-T-H) that, when read, cause "instant death and damnation to Hell." They appear as a cadaverous human wearing a tattered black shroud. Their eye sockets and mouths are full of sticky green mucus, and they make a "horrible gurgling noise" when speaking.

## Special Abilities

- If the Messenger of Death is able to touch a target, it can mark it for death. The Messenger must carve, paint, or otherwise write D-E-A-T-H where it can be seen by the target and if all five letters are read in order (at least an hour apart) the target will die.
- Attacks on a Messenger of Death with a non-magical weapon suffer a -2 penalty on the damage roll.
