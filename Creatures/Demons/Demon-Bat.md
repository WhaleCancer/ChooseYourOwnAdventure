## Description

These creatures are found on both the Magical and Demonic planes. They are common summonings to serve as guards on Titan. They are strong-willed, delight in violence, and are not easily controlled. They take the shape of a large (3' wingspan) ethereal bat wreathed in dancing flame, but have a physical form. They communicate by squeaks but can speak if they choose. They possess small rear claws for grasping and manipulating, but cannot wield weapons.

## Special Abilities

- If a Demon Bat hits the same target for two successive combat rounds, it unleashes a burst of flame, causing an additional 5 points of STAMINA damage (armour applies).
- When "killed," it explodes into flame instead of disintegrating, causing 1D6 STAMINA damage to everyone nearby (armour does not apply to this damage).
