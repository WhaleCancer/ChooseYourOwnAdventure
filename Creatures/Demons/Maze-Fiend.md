## Description

Maze Fiends are similar to common Fiends but are not as heavily built and have grey leathery skin instead of red. They are found in abundance in the labyrinths of the Kazan city of Korkut, are very partial to man flesh, and are kept under strict control by their summoners.

## Special Abilities

- A Maze Fiend can breathe fire at one opponent within hand-to-hand combat range every round, in addition to its normal attack. The fire hits on a roll of 1-2 on a D6 and inflicts 1 STAMINA damage, to which armour does not apply.
- If offered flowers, a Maze Fiend will be powerless to attack the giver unless attacked by them. This effect lasts until the two meet again.
