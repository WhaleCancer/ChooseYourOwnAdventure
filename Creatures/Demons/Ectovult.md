## Description

These creatures are native to the Demonic Planes that feed on lesser demons. They are sometimes summoned by evil wizards to collect items, but some have "gone wild" and now live freely in the mountains. They have a "bulbous head with a large and vicious beak," a long neck, a body, a whiplike tail, and two large wings. Their body has no other limbs and is translucent. They are used on Demonic planes to tow chariots or as mounts, screech incessantly, can land but only wriggle on the ground, and manipulate objects with their beak.

## Special Abilities

- An Ectovult can pick up an item as large as a man by crashing into it. This collision breaks the Ectovult into a million glass-like pieces...only for it to reform a few seconds later with the item inside it. The Ectovult can only carry one item this way (which is itself not harmed but is immobilised) and can regurgitate it at any time.
- Anyone attacking an Ectovult with a non-magical weapon applies a -3 penalty to the damage roll.
- Cold and Ice spells have a great effect on an Ectovult, doubling the rolled damage.
- The Ectovult can fly as well as a bird.
