## Description

Also known as the K’rllk, the MANTIS DEMON

takes the form of a giant insect, resembling a

grotesquely huge praying mantis, in plated armour

of chitin with lethally sharp, spiny forearms. Their

head is dominated by insane staring eyes, long

wavy antennae and horribly cla;ering mandibles.

Sensing prey by both eyesight and smell, the Mantis

Demon will scu;le forwards to a;ack with fast,

darting a;acks from its claws and its biting jaws.

The chitinous armour of the Mantis Demon is

difficult to penetrate. Anyone wounding it will only
