## Description

Some Demons pass the time by roasting the souls of the
damned over steaming pits of brimstone and sulphur. Others
enjoy trying to tempt holy men, as they fast in the wilderness,
with the delights of being evil, just once. And some stalk the
Earth as DEATH SPIDERS, luring adventurers to Hell as a
spider lures a fly. These diabolic creatures appear as massive
grey-black spiders, but instead of normal arachnid heads they
have demonic heads, with a malevolent travesty of a human
face. Almost five metres across, they lurk in dungeons and
ruins, ready to trap an unwary explorer.
When encountered, they will usually be in the centre of, or at
least close by, a large web. This near-invisible tangle of sticky,
silver strands is the Demon's link with the Realms of the
Damned, and is used to capture its victims. When it attacks,
the Death Spider tries to bite its opponent, both to inflict
damage and to inject a paralysing poison. If its attack
succeeds, the adventurer must Test for Luck. If he fails, he is
paralysed by the venom, and will be dragged on to the web
and bitten until he dies.
Once stuck to the web, the corpse of the dead adventurer,
together with the Death Spider and its ghostly web, will start
to dematerialise, and return to the Demon's plane, where the
soul of the victim can be extracted at its pleasure, and tortured
for the rest of eternity!
