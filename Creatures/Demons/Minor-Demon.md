## Description

These Demons are the standard Demon minion, not particularly powerful, and lacking special abilities. They are used as soldiers, guards, and servants by more powerful Demons of Hell. Minor Demons are roughly man-sized and humanoid, with red scaly skin, small horns of various types on their heads, and glowing red eyes. They can, with care, pass as human if appropriately cowled and swathed in cloaks and gloves, making them often used as servants by Demonologists and other summoners.

## Special Abilities

None.
