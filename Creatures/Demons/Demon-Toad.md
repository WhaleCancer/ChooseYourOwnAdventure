## Description

These foul creatures resemble giant toads, covered in reeking slime and tiny wriggling worms. They have a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth and large side-set glowing yellow eyes. They can talk and can grasp and manipulate with their front "hands" but cannot use a weapon in combat. They are around three feet long and weigh almost as much as a man. They swim well and are found in swamps and marshes, lurking below the oily surface of stagnant ponds.

## Special Abilities

Demon Toads can use a Great Leap attack where they can move up to 20' before gaining a +2 bonus on the attack total. However, this attack can only be used if the Demon Toad is not currently engaged in combat.
