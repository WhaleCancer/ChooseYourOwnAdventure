## Description

Ice Demons are Type IV, feared in high mountains and icy wastes of Titan, sometimes summoned by shamen or appearing spontaneously, always leaving destruction. They appear as a three-meter tall, fleshy humanoid, seemingly carved from ice, with a bestial face, huge ram horns curling around its head, and bat wings (also made of ice) that allow limited flight.

## Special Abilities

- An Ice Demon can breathe freezing vapor onto one engaged enemy every round, hitting on a roll of 1-3 on a D6. This attack ignores armor and causes 1 point of damage.
- The Ice Demon has three Attacks and can fight three enemies simultaneously, but may only attack an individual enemy once per round.
- It is ferociously strong and has a bonus of +2 to hand-to-hand damage rolls.
- It can communicate with fellow Pact Demons and significant mortals via telepathy, regardless of distance.
- It can fly, though it rarely gets more than 20 feet from the ground, has a slow flight speed, and cannot fly for long.
