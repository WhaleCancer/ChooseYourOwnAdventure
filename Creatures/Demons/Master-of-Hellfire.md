## Description

These demons are a more powerful version of the Hellfire Spirit, rarely summoned but rumored to be controlled by powerful evil wizards. It initially appears as a demonic humanoid with horns, steel claws, flaming eyes, and a hooded robe. When "killed" by non-magical weapons, it transforms into its "true form": a decaying human zombie with blazing fiery eyes.

## Special Abilities

- An attack on a Master of Hellfire has a -2 penalty on all damage rolls made by non-magical weapons.
- The Master of Hellfire has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Master of Hellfire may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- Every Master of Hellfire knows two innate wizardry spells that they can cast at will. When this form first manifests, two of: Darkness, Ignite, Wall, Fire Bolt, Fly or Explode should be chosen. Using this spell takes a full round but does not require a roll.
- When a Master of Hellfire is "killed" by non-magical weapons, it spends a round morphing into its true form with half of its initial STAMINA (round up). This form does not have the above powers but can shoot bolts of hellfire from its eyes at enemies within sight. This bolt hits automatically and inflicts 1D6 points of STAMINA damage with no protection from armour. When this form reaches full STAMINA, the Demon reforms into the robed form and regains the above abilities.
