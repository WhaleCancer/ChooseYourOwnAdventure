## Description

These are piscine Demons found in isolated regions of the Isles of the Dawn. They prey on lone travellers and are said to "collapse back into a pool of water when killed," with "tiny golden fish leap out of the stream when the Yuemo is killed." They are vaguely humanoid and human sized with a fish-like head. They are covered in glittering gold or silver scales and have razor sharp fins instead of hands, meaning they cannot manipulate items or wield a weapon.

## Special Abilities

None.
