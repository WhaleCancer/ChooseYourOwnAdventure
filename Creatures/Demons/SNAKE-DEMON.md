## Description

These are servants of three Snake Demon Princes, occasionally sent to the world of Titan, but never summoned by mortals. They are a 10-foot tall humanoid with greenish-black skin, huge bat wings, four arms, and a snake-like head.

## Special Abilities

- The Aura of Evil that surrounds a Snake Demon causes all mortals who come near to immediately lose 1 point of SKILL and 2 points of LUCK.
- An attack on a Snake Demon has a -2 penalty on all damage rolls made by non-magical weapons.
