## Description

The Quag-Shugguth is a demon summoned by powerful summoners, fifteen meters tall, moving on four thickset legs with suckered hands, grey-green skin with red veins, tiny eyes, and a huge mouth filled with teeth from which six long tentacles protrude.

## Special Abilities

- Three attacks, able to fight three enemies simultaneously, but only attacking an individual enemy once per round.
- Constant writhing tentacles prevent enemies from getting close, allowing the demon to reduce the SKILL of enemies in hand-to-hand combat by a total of 4, which can be applied to one enemy or divided amongst close enemies.
