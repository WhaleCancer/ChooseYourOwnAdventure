## Description

The CASTLE IMP is a tiny, scrawny humanoid,

often found infesting old castles and crumbling

mansions, where it lives off rats, mice and other

vermin. They will arm themselves with a long

needle or skewering pin; this only does 1 STAMINA

point of damage if it hits. Castle Imps excavate a

series of crawlways throughout the stonework of

the building they inhabit, which lead to a hidden

lair where they keep their treasure. It is rumoured

some Castle Imps even have the power to move

through solid substances such as stone and wood

for short periods of time; popping out of a wall to

stab at someone with their sharp needle before

melting back into the stonework to hide in one of

their tunnels. These cramped passages may be

accessible to larger folk but are difficult to fight in,

and anyone who finds themselves in combat in

such a place must deduct 3 from their A;ack
