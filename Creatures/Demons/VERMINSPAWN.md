## Description

"The hissing sound grew louder and suddenly

was that its body was completely covered by

worms, lice, cockroaches, maggots, rats and

leeches that crawled in and out of every orifice,

crease and fold on its bloated form. A forked

tongue flicked out of its gaping mouth, which

housed rows of blackened teeth…"
