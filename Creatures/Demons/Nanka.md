## Description

Nanka are "direct servants of the Gods of Evil," sent to Titan to fulfill nefarious requirements and capture immortal souls by laying traps. They appear as a vague legless humanoid composed of dense black smoke with a pair of glinting eyes. Their form is fluid and changes as they move.

## Special Abilities

- An attack on a Nanka has a -2 penalty on all damage rolls made by non-magical weapons.
- Being formed of "condensed smoke," it can flow through small gaps and force itself into a small bottle.
