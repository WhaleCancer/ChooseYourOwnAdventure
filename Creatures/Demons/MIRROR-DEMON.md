## Description

These demons are usually summoned or appear in mundane mirrors, can leave their vicinity, reside on a lower Demonic plane, create their own reality, slide between worlds, and spontaneously appear on Titan. They have a normal human shape but with four arms, four faces, and clawed hands. They are described as quick movers and can slide into a mirror at will, appearing as part of the reflection.

## Special Abilities

- Their four arms allow two attacks against separate opponents (one attack per opponent per round). They can also use two shields, gaining extra protection against all opponents.
- If they win an Attack round, they can forgo damage to grab an opponent. If a mirror is nearby, they can, on the following successful Attack round, drag the enemy into the mirror, trapping them forever. Conversely, breaking the mirror while the Demon is inside will banish it back to the Demonic plane, effectively "killing" it.
