## Description

Nightgaunts are humanoid demons commonly used as servants by evil sorcerers. They lack mouths or ears but can see, hear, and speak. They are roughly man-shaped creatures with glistening black skin and no face, only a smooth curve. They wear hooded grey or black robes, said to be fashioned from solidified shadow.

## Special Abilities

- Any enemy fighting a Nightgaunt for the first time receives a -2 penalty to their Attack total due to its unnerving appearance.
- Nightgaunts have very keen hearing and get a +3 bonus on all sound-based Awareness tests.
