## Description

Fire Demons are "greatest of the Lesser Demons of Hell," dispatched to lead evil armies on Titan, and summoned by Demonologists as champions. They are 10' tall humanoids with red skin, leathery bat wings, horns and cloven hooves, normally "wreathed in flickering flames and curling smoke."

## Special Abilities

- The fiery weapons wielded by this Demon have a +2 bonus to the damage rolls. The whip inflicts damage as a morning star.
- A Fire Demon can shoot streams of fire from both nostrils. This fire will hit an enemy fighting the Demon on a roll of 1-4 on a D6 and will inflict 2 points of STAMINA damage. Armour provides no protection.
- The Fire Demon has three Attacks and so may fight three enemies simultaneously. The Fire Demon may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
