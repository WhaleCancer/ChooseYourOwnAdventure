## Description

These are humanoid Demons with leathery red skin and are well armed with claws, teeth and horns. They were summoned by ancient desert kingdoms as guardians and assassins and linger on in forgotten ruins and ancient tombs. Fiends are roughly human sized, but are heavier set and incredibly ugly. They usually rely on their natural weapons but can use normal weapons or even armour. They will often eat their victims, roasting them gently with their fiery breath.

## Special Abilities

A Fiend can breathe fire at one opponent within hand to hand range every round in addition to its normal attack. The fire hits on a roll of 1-2 on a D6 and inflicts 1 STAMINA damage. Armour does not apply to this damage.
