## Description

These demons are found in deep, lonely woodlands, either summoned or having found their way there. They show care for their environment and rage against those who defile their woodland. They are large humanoid forms made from bark, moss, and fungus, often infested with insects. They have a skull-like face with black sunken eyes and huge wooden claws.

## Special Abilities

- The Wood Demon has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Wood Demon may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- On the first round of a fight, a Wood Demon may lash out with long vines to try and capture an enemy. The target must test their SKILL, and on a failure are grabbed and held. The target may cut themself free if they have a knife or other blade, but this takes a full round and a successful test of SKILL. Until free, the target's movement is limited and all actions are at a penalty of -4.
