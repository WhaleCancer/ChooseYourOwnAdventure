## Description

These Demons are found in Scorpion Swamp and marshy areas on every continent, not often summoned by "civilised conjurers" as guards, but by "primitive tribes" as warriors. They are bigger than common Fiends, nearly seven feet tall, scaly and green and brown in colour with clawed hands and multiple horns on their heads. They are unable to breathe fire like their kin.

## Special Abilities

None.
