## Description

These Demons are used on the Demonic Planes as guards, housekeepers, impromptu snacks and indeed just about any role required by a greater Demon. They are normally pathetically eager to please their master, whatever the demand. These Demons appear as a human skeleton with red sparkling eyes. When they are directly controlled by a Conjurer or Demon Prince, the eyes glow brighter. Demonic Servants wear threadbare black hooded robes.

## Special Abilities

None.
