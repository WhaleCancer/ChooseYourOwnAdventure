## Description

The BLACK IMP is a treacherous creature, resembling a tiny man, no more than half a metre tall, wearing tight-fitting black clothes. They have pointed ears and a wispy grey beard. Black Imps are typically summoned by wizards for espionage and information gathering, excelling at sneaking and eavesdropping. They are also larcenous thieves, capable of stealing anything not secured.

Black Imps possess minor magic, usually one or two spells like Darkness, Illusion, or Sleep, which they can cast once a day. A common tactic is to feign helplessness to lure victims, then cast a Sleep spell to steal valuables. They fight with daggers if their magic is depleted, but are generally cowardly and will flee when possible.
