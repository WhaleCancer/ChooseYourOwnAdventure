## Description

Diabolus demons are rare, found as advisors to evil Archmages and Archpriests, or as commanders for demonic armies. They appear almost human but with a demonic face, dark grey skin, long black hair, small pointed horns, slender legs ending in hooves. They wear silks or armor and often have a cloak that appears to blow without wind.

## Special Abilities

- The Diabolus has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Diabolus may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- The Diabolus is able to issue commands to other Demons that must be obeyed. This command takes a full round and the target Demon must obey whatever the command is for that round only.
- A Diabolus is often used as an officer for the armies of Hell due to their tactical genius. On the first round of a combat, all allies of the Diabolus gain a bonus of +2 to all Attack totals.
