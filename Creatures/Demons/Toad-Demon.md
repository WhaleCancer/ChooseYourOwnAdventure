## Description

The TOAD DEMON is known by many names:

Graalsch, the Swamp Dweller, and the Consumer,

to state but a few. However, regardless of title, its

appearance is always the same; an enormous giant

toad-being, warty and slimy, with a mouth almost

as large as its head. Toad Demons a;ack by leaping

at their victims and biting at them with powerful

tooth-lined jaws. They are completely immune to

fire, and suffer no STAMINA damage from any fire-

based a;ack, magical or otherwise. On the Demonic

Plane they are found in dank pits on both the Plane

of Bile and the Plane of Ichor, whereas on Titan

they have been known to take up residence in a

tangled swamp, worshipped as a god by the local

creatures, whether they be Kokomokoa, Marsh

Goblins, or the Slykk. Priests who follow the ways

of the gods of the Animal Court claim there is much

antipathy and strife between Furlakk the Frog God
