## Description

These creatures inhabit a remote part of the Demonic plane, possessing a strong sense of independence from the Princes, and being rarely summoned by evil wizards or seen on Titan. They appear as a seven foot tall stick-thin humanoid with grey skin, large black eyes, no nose and a tiny slit for a mouth. They usually wear dark grey robes and move slowly when walking.

## Special Abilities

- A Time Demon may, at the start of the round, remove themselves from the stream of time. They no longer exist anywhere (for that round at least) and nothing can affect them. Whilst play continues around the table, the player must put their fingers in their ears and close their eyes. At the start of the following round, they must decide whether to re-enter time, without knowing what happened whilst they were away.
- The Time Demon can, by sacrificing some of their own strength, speed up time for them only. By sacrificing 2 STAMINA points, the Demon may take two full rounds whilst the rest of the world takes one. Enemies attacked during this extra round roll their attack total as normal, but if they win they simply avoid the attack and do not themselves inflict damage.
- The Time Demon has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Time Demon may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
