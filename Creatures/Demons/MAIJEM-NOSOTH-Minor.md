## Description

These are lesser form of the beings also known as the Lords of Gond. They have "tremendous hunger" and will eat "Demons, mortals, plants and indeed most things." They are "much feared on the mortal plane" and "sometimes summoned to act as assassins." They have a "foul ulcer-covered spherical body supported on jointed crab-like legs." It also has "a single crab claw and several tentacles." The demon is "surrounded by a sort of heat-haze, making it difficult to see details on its body."

## Special Abilities

- **Damage Resistance:** When a blow is landed on a Maijem-Nossoth, roll 1D6. On a 1-2, any damage is ignored. On a 3-4, reduce the damage (after armour) by 1 STAMINA point and on a 5-6 apply the damage as normal.
- **Damage Bonus:** The great strength of this Demon allows it a +1 bonus to damage rolls.
- **Multiple Attacks:** The Maijem-Nossoth has four Attacks and so may fight four enemies simultaneously. The Demon may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- **Weakness to Noise:** This Demon is very susceptible to high-pitched noises. If an enemy whistles during combat, the Maijem-Nossoth loses 1 point of STAMINA per round. An actual whistle, pipe or flute will inflict 3 points of STAMINA damage per round!
