## Description

These demons are larger, more powerful, and more feared than their lesser versions. They have a "foul ulcer-covered spherical body supported on jointed crab-like legs," a "single crab claw," and "several tentacles." They are surrounded by a "heat-haze," making details difficult to discern.

## Special Abilities

- **Damage Reduction:** When a blow is landed, roll 1D6. On a 1-2, damage is ignored. On a 3-5, damage (after armour) is reduced by 1 STAMINA point. On a 6, damage is applied normally.
- **Strength Bonus:** Gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls.
- **Attacks:** Has four attacks and can fight four enemies simultaneously, but can only attack an individual enemy once per round.
- **Susceptibility:** Highly susceptible to high-pitched noises. An enemy whistling causes 1 STAMINA loss per round. An actual whistle, pipe, or flute inflicts 3 points of STAMINA damage per round!
