## Description

Hell Demons are among the strongest servants dispatched from Hell, causing terror. They appear as 10' tall scaly humanoids surrounded by steam and sulphurous fumes, with huge misshapen heads, fangs, horns, and cloven hooves for feet.

## Special Abilities

- The Hell Demon has two Attacks and so may fight two enemies simultaneously. The Hell Demon may only attack an individual enemy once in any round.
- These Demons are strong and have a +2 bonus to damage rolls made in hand to hand combat.
- An attack on a Hell Demon has a -2 penalty on all damage rolls made by non-magical weapons.
- A Hell Demon may take the form of any human they personally kill, retaining that form until either the following dawn or until a round is spent assuming the Demon's real form. Whilst in human form, the Demon has their usual characteristics but not the abilities listed above.
