## Description

These are simple beings of hate and destruction, not great thinkers, summoned purely to destroy and kill. They are up to twelve feet tall, vaguely humanoid, made entirely of rock. Their legs appear submerged in the earth, as if they wade through undisturbed ground.

## Special Abilities

- They have two Attacks and can fight two enemies simultaneously, but can only attack an individual enemy once per round.
- They are very strong and have a +2 bonus to all damage rolls.
