## Description

MAIJEM-NOSOTH
     Major      Minor
 
summoner is, Demonic Plane
Thought to be named, in somewhat scrambled fashion,
after the first unfortunate scholar who summoned one and
was subsequently devoured, the MAIJEM-NOSOTH
belongs to an obscure race of demons known as the Lords
of Gond. They are usually called forth from the Pit to act
as guardians or assassins, but must be constrained with
powerful magic due to their insatiable appetites. Any error
in the summoning process will almost certainly result in
the creature running amok and consuming everyone in
the immediate vicinity! The Maijem-Nosoth has a
particularly horrendous appearance that is thankfully
difficult to focus on, owing to the shimmering haze that
surrounds the beast. Those who gaze beyond this will find
their eyes ache from looking at its foul ulcerous body,
supported by jointed legs, with a single large claw that
clacks against its slimy carapace, and bloated tentacles,
coated with ichor that lash out at its victims.
The major power of the Maijem-Nosoth is its near-
invincibility. Their carapace is proof against all but the
most potent and enchanted vorpal blades, and some of
the fleshy organs that comprise the rest of their body are
capable of instant regeneration. What is more, because the
form of the creature is so hard to focus on, adventurers
won’t be able to direct their blows effectively. Every time
an adventurer actually wounds the creature (and gets past
its armour), roll one die. On a 1 or a 2, no damage is
inflicted; on a 3 or a 4 they do 1 point of STAMINA damage;
on a 5 or a 6 they do 2 points of STAMINA damage. The one
vulnerability of the Maijem-Nosoth, known to very few
learned sages and cautious adventurers, is that it cannot
abide high-pitched noises. Anyone who can whistle
during combat will cause the creature to lose 1 STAMINA
point per round; and if they have an actual whistle or set
of pipes, will inflict 3 STAMINA points of damage on the
creature per round! Should they defeat the Maijem-
Nosoth, it will collapse in a twitching heap and dissolve
into a greenish slimy mess that hisses and steams.
