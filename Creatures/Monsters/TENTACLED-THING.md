## Description

In desolate areas, far away from the settlements of men, evil
lurks writhing and gibbering in blind hatred of light and life.
Unwary explorers sometimes stumble into its domain, heed-
less of its presence until strong, slimy tentacles lash out of the
murky water and wrap around their legs. The TENTACLED
THING is powerful and cunning, and will soon drag them
floundering into its pool. Even the hardiest warriors find it
difficult to fight for their lives when entangled in thick,
crushing tentacles under several metres of filthy water. Un-
less the victim can kill the monstrous creature in less Attack
Rounds than his current SKILL score, he will drown and be
devoured. Should he manage to kill the bloated monster, he
will be able to extricate himself from its lifeless coils and rise
to the surface coughing and choking, but otherwise alive and
safe . . . for the time being.
