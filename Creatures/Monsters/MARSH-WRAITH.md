## Description

In the dark, fetid creeks and backwaters of slow-moving
rivers and marshland, danger sometimes lurks, ready to catch
adventurers unawares. Man is not lord over every domain;
in some areas, older, darker beings hold sway. MARSH
WRAITHS are strange, primal creatures, related to Earth
Elementals, and dwell in the still waters among the head-high
reeds. They spend much of their time wallowing in the mud,
lazily sifting insects into their mouths. They are very
territorial creatures, and will tenaciously defend their patches
against any intruders who would disturb them.
Should they sense the vibrations of approaching creatures
through the water and rushes, Marsh Wraiths will rise from
the swamp as one. When solidifying for an attack, they form
themselves into a vaguely humanoid shape, dripping with
slime. They will try to warn off the trespassers in a sombre
moaning voice that has given many men the impression that
they are some strange form of undead being (hence their

name). If warnings do not deter the intruders, they will attack,
all at once, in a coordinated assault that belies their low
intelligence, and try to smother their opponent in mud.
Because of their insubstantial forms, hits on them will only
do 1 point of STAMINA damage. If a Marsh Wraith is very
severely injured, it will retreat by dropping back into the mud
and swimming away under the surface of the water.
Little is known about the life-cycle of a Marsh Wraith. Smaller
creatures have been encountered, but sages have been
divided over whether they were females, immature young,
or just smaller than normal. One theory is that the creatures
reproduce by dividing themselves into separate Marsh
Wraiths, each instantly able to carry on living as normal. It is
not thought that they keep any possessions; their slimy forms
would not be able to grasp any treasure long enough to
appreciate it.
