## Description

Thought possibly to be related to the fearsome Manticore, with which it has some similarities, the **NINE-TAILS** is an equally hideous beast. It looks like a huge, predatory cat with a fiery red coat and mane, a ridge of spikes growing from its spine, and huge fangs. Lashing behind the beast are several long, snake-like tails, each ending in a stinging barb. It truly is a cat-o'-nine-tails! This mutant cat will attack by trying to slash at its victim with its great claws and bite them with its sharp fangs.

However, when the Nine-Tails wins an Attack Round, roll one die. On a roll of five or six, it has wounded its opponent with its venomous barbed tails instead: the victim must roll one die and deduct the number rolled from their STAMINA score. A victim may not make an Armour Roll to negate this damage but they may Test their Luck if they wish to reduce it.

Nine-Tails are rare creatures, found in desolate tropical areas, such as lonely jungles and remote wilderness regions.
