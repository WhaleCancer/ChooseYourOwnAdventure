## Description

Lurking just below the surface of the ground, danger waits
to surprise unwary travellers in the form of EARTH
DEMONS. These enormous creatures are not true Demons,
but earned their name for the ferocious and alarming way
they attack. The huge beasts lie a few centimetres under the
ground, listening for the heavy tread of a suitable foe. When
they feel one approaching, they burst out of the ground,
dripping with mud and dragging roots and bushes with them.
They tower over three and a half metres tall, primitive arms
and tentacles reaching out to grab and crush their opponent.
An Earth Demon's strength is drawn from the soil itself. While
it is in contact with the ground, a wound against it will only
cause 1 point of STAMINA damage, instead of the usual 2.
However, if the monster can somehow be separated from the
source of its powers, it will be seriously wounded. After a
successful strike, instead of hitting the creature its opponent
can try to lift it, by rolling two dice. On the roll of a double,
he has managed to lift the struggling beast off the ground,
causing it immediately to suffer 6 points of STAMINA
damage.
Strangely enough, these belligerent creatures do not eat their
opponents. They are rumoured to be the result of a failed
experiment by a foolish sorcerer. A potion was spilled on the
ground, creating the first Earth Demon, and the creatures
have hated all mankind ever since.
