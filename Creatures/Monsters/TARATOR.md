## Description

TARATORS are huge, ugly beasts usually found wandering
around caverns underground. They stand almost two and a
half metres tall, and their fat, leathery bodies are humanoid
in shape and covered in folds of grey-green skin. Their huge
heads look like an unfortunate cross between a toad and a
gibbon, and they have enormous mouths to serve their main
occupation, which is eating.
Tarators are solitary creatures, mostly because of their foul
temperaments. They stamp around their domains, snarling
to themselves and cursing all existence. They will attack
almost anything they take a dislike to, from Dragons to
daisies, and they can be very dangerous adversaries. In a
fight, their enormous clawed fists allow them to do 3 points
of damage after a successful hit. However, a winning hit
against them in return will do 1 point less damage than

usual, because of their thick, blubbery skin. Tarators rarely
stay in one place very long, for obvious reasons, and they
never keep treasure, except to eat out of spite.
