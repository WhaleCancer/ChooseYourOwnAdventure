## Description

Somewhere between a bear and an ape, and larger than either,
the NANDIBEAR is a brutal, solitary beast found only in
isolated regions. It is carnivorous, its favourite food being
human flesh (especially the brains!). Despite its great size, it

can move very quietly, since soft pads on its great clawed feet
soften its tread. When it attacks from behind, it will surprise
its opponent, and automatically cause 2 points of s T A M I
N A damage with its powerful claws. After this first attack
the fight will proceed as usual.
A Nandibear will often make its lair in a cave or hollow in
the rocks, where it will return with food it has caught. The
lair will be full of bones and half-chewed meat, but little
treasure, for the Nandibear has no need of it and clears it from
its home regularly.
