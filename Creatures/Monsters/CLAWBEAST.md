## Description

Some species have evolved, in isolation in the wild, into
savage carnivorous killing machines. Lions and sharks are
prime examples; less common are the Gretch of the southern
deserts, and the CLAW-BEASTS of the north. Taller than a
man by almost a head, they are brutish killers, covered in long
shaggy clumps of thick hair, which gives them a mottled
colouring somewhere between green, grey and brown. They
have four arms, instead of two, and each ends in a vicious
curving hook which they use like scythes when attacking. In
the wild these predators are rarely found together, for their
vast appetites and prodigious hunting can clear an area of all

suitable food in a few weeks. As a result, Clawbeasts are
perpetually on the move, searching for fresh hunting-grounds
where they can feed for a short while before migrating
onwards.
It is whispered that a few of these creatures are kept by an
unknown nobleman in the southlands. The evil lord allows
them to roam his treasure-vaults, tossing down to them just
enough food each day to stop them eating one another, but
not enough to satisfy their hunger. As a result, the Clawbeasts
roam far and wide through their subterranean reaches,
sniffing for food as they wander.
