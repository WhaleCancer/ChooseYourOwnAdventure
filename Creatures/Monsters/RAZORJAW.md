## Description

The RAZORJAW makes its nest among the foul sulphur pools
and boiling mud around volcanoes; such a volatile and
nauseous habitat suits the vile creature admirably. Over four
metres long, they are slimy, reptilian monstrosities with
ungainly, leathery bodies and stubby limbs. Their long, scaly
necks support eyeless heads with great mouths lined with
sharp teeth. The beasts are not affected by their blindness at
all, for they have such an inbuilt hatred of all life that they
can attack unerringly. From the very moment it bursts out of
its huge, strangely shaped egg, a young Razorjaw knows only
that it is hungry, and that it hates! Thankfully, Razorjaws are
very rare, and will only ever be encountered in inaccessible
volcanic areas, where they can wallow and thrash in the foul
pools of mud, sulphur and steam.
