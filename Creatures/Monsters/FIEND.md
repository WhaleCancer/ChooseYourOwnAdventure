One of the many bestial races lurking around the fringes
of the Desert of Skulls is the red-skinned, fire-breathing
FIEND. Recent research by the Hamakei mystic Vulpa
Heartsfire has found that the Fiends were originally a type
of Demon that was summoned to Titan and bound here
by the ancient Djaratians. What is interesting is that Vulpa
also discovered this knowledge had spread throughout
several Irritarian nations as far south as the mercantile
state of Taralak in what is now western Khul. This perhaps
explains why we find several other types of Fiend
currently living in Khul today.
Firstly, and rather different from its relatives, is the
MARSH FIEND, which has been found from Minak Sikla,
the great swamp near the southern city-state of Zamarra,
all the way to Scorpion Swamp in the north, and beyond.
This creature is much bigger in size, though it lacks the
ability to breathe fire, with greenish brown scaly skin,
clawed hands, and an impressive row of curved horns that
runs down its back, providing some extra protection.
Marsh Fiends lurk near fords or stepping-stones, in groups
of two to twelve creatures, waiting for lone wayfarers to
ambush and feast upon. They are also known to prey on
both Swamp Orcs and Chrabats, though curiously they
leave the Elkiem well alone.
Much more similar to their Allansian counterparts are the
MAZE FIENDS of Kazan, so-called for their presence in
many of the great stone labyrinths that are attached to
each of the six tribal cities of that nation. These creatures
are especially abundant in the maze of the southern
city-port of Korkut, where it has been discovered they are
partial to gifts of flowers. Anyone bribing a Maze Fiend
with flowers will not have to fight them in combat! Maze
Fiends can also breathe fire at their opponents. Roll one
die every Attack Round, and on a roll of 1, they have
singed their enemy for 1 extra STAMINA point of damage.
