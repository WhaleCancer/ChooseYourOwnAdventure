## Description

Not even sages record a name for these creatures more
specific than simply LIFE-STEALERS. Certainly, for the
mountain tribes who live in constant fear of their attacks, no
other name is necessary. Flying out from their lairs high in
the peaks, they wreak havoc on isolated farmsteads and
small villages in their quest for human food.
Life-Stealers are tall, thin humanoids with sinewy, leathery
bodies. Their heads are long and thin, the skin stretched taut
across the skull. Their ears are wide and almost bat-like, and
they have short tusks which spill from a mouth brimming
with teeth.
Their eyes are milky white and apparently lifeless, but be-
hind them lies a wickedly cunning intelligence, always full
of plans for filling their gullets with fresh meat. Despite their
wiry forms and thin, dangling limbs, the Stealers are inhu-
manly strong. They fly with surprising elegance, using the
large pair of feathery wings that sprouts from their shoulders.
Life-Stealers live in large caves high in the mountains, in
groups of two or three. It is not known how they reproduce,
if at all. No young have ever been seen in a raid, and no one
has been able to get anywhere near their lofty homes and
return to tell of what they saw there! Some folk-tales, though,
say that the Life-Stealers are the warriors of the evil Storm
God Sukh, said to dwell in an enormous stone palace high in
the clouds above the mountains. Such stories are usually
nothing more than rumours, though many of them also point
out that some Life-Stealer corpses have been found, after
unsuccessful raids, wearing gold pendants in the form of
Sukh's traditional symbol – a skull with a circular mouth, as
if blowing the wind. Such pendants are extremely rare, and
considered highly valuable by many sages anxious to get
their hands on one. Most are unable ever to do so. Life-
Stealers may be rare, but dead ones are rarer still. When they
come soaring down on the thermals from their desolate
peaks, broad wings beating together in a rhythm of death,
they usually get what they desire – a feast of human flesh.
