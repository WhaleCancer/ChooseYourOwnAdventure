## Description

ARCRONS are peculiar jelly-like creatures covered in tentacles and suckers, and found wandering in a number of desolate parts across Khul. They are foul beasts, the result of an accident during an experiment to spawn a new creature centuries ago by the sorcerer Ransond, of the almost-forgotten land of Sorvok (possibly in the vicinity of modern-day Arkand). During his experiment something went drastically wrong and the laboratory exploded, killing Ransond but letting his new creation escape.

The badly mutated creature fled into the wilderness, and little was heard of it for many years. However, the Arcron reproduces by dividing into two perfect copies of itself, every twenty years or so. Now, over half a millennia later, there are many of the beasts scattered around Khul, wandering the wilds in search of food.
