## Description

Not all monsters encountered in the underground

caverns of Titan are large and ferocious; some are

small but equally deadly. An example of this is the

MIMIC STALACTITE, or as many subterranean

races know them, “Death From Above”. These are

usually found living in colonies of two to twelve

creatures on the ceiling of a cavern, clustered

amidst outcrops of real stalactites. Mimic Stalactites

may cast strange shadows by torch or lantern-light,

and even look like they are moving. A cautious

adventurer may be convinced that the stalactites

really are moving and look up – but by then it is too

late and the Mimic Stalactites are already raining

down upon their victim. Roll two dice to determine

how many Mimic Stalactites hit their target, though

the number cannot be more than the number of

creatures in the colony. The hits are spread evenly

among all victims present, and each successful

strike causes 2 STAMINA points of damage, though
