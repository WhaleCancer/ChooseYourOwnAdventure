## Description

Woe betides those who disturb the hairy fiend known across Allansia as the MANIC BEAST! This bulky, vaguely humanoid creature stands close to two metres tall on stocky legs, with a muscular torso covered in short, bristly fur. Its arms are long and end in splay-fingered hands whose job it is to drag prey and food within range of the creature's razor-fanged mouth. The wild-eyed Manic Beast's name and fearsome reputation however, come from its tremendous bursts of rage. When wounded in combat for example, its anger will rise, and during the next Attack Round it adds two to the dice roll for its Attack Strength. If it is wounded during this Attack Round, the bonus will be retained for the next Round, but if it is not wounded then its temper returns to normal (or as close to normal as a Manic Beast's temper can be).
