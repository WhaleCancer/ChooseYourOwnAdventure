## Description

The Xanthic Horror is a result of toxic magical effluence contaminating sewers or waterways. It is a shapeless, glowing yellow blob with numerous writhing tentacles, feelers, and tendrils. Its habitat is fouled streams and creeks, such as the Bilgewater in central Allansia.

The creature lurks in deep pools, shambling forth to attack prey, heaving itself out of water and slithering across the ground with waving tentacles. It is slow, allowing up to three missile weapon attacks before melee combat.
