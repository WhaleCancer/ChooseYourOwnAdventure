## Description

The NECROWORM is a bizarre construct; a weird

hybrid of reptile, worm and who knows what!

Many meters in length, it is a multi-legged, slimy,

yellow-green worm, with a skeletal reptilian head

that drips filth and ordure. Slithering towards its

victims in a sinuous wave, the Necroworm will

open its jaws wide, a;empting to savage its prey

with razor-sharp, knife-long teeth! Worse, if it bites

its victim even once, and they survive the ba;le,

then they have been infected with a vile wasting

disease. Unless a cure is found quickly, they will

lose 1 point from both their current and Initial

STAMINA

scores

each

day,

until

they

expire.
