## Description

Also known as the Shaggy Shambler, the **SHAUCA** is a much-feared beast of southern Allansia, from Arantis, through the lands of the Glimmering Sea, to Shabak. Similar in appearance in some respects to the Yeti of the frozen north, it makes its home in caves and lost valleys, from which it strides forth to prey upon the local populace. Indeed, creatures like the Shauca are but one of the reasons that many southern settlements, no matter what their size, are heavily fortified with walls and guard-towers. It is a large, ape-like creature, well over two metres tall, and covered in long thick fur that ranges in colour from sandy-yellow to a dark mottled brown. Its legs are like tree-trunks and its eyes like water-filled saucers. It has a small mouth with pointed teeth.
