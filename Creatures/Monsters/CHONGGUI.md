## Description

Manifold are the dangers of the mysterious East. Possibly one of the most horrific, from Hachiman and the Isles of the Dawn, is the foul parasitic arthropod known as the CHONGGUI. A distant relative of the Gonchong, it is a black spider-like beast, the size of a large melon. Attached to its sac-like body are many skittering legs, and a head with snapping insectoid jaws.

The full life cycle of the Chonggui is poorly understood, but what is known is that the adult creature lives within the body cavity of a human being, taking up most of the abdominal space below the victim's rib-cage. Here it will control the movements of its host, instructing the body to move around and appear "alive" in a sense; though sticking only to dark, damp places, for the creature detests the light. Once however the host body begins to rot and decay, the Chonggui will seek out a new victim. The host body will walk about searching for another human, with beady staring eyes, a fixed grin on their face, and arms outstretched to indicate they are unarmed. They wear clothing to conceal the parasite.

The Chonggui attacks with a surprise attack by its slavering jaws tearing a hole in the abdomen of a new victim. If successful, the old host body collapses, and the creature takes residence in the new host. If the Chonggui and its host are killed, it dissolves into acidic slime.

**Note:** The listed scores are for a Chonggui and its host body. If encountered alone (without a host), its scores are SKILL 4, STAMINA 5.
