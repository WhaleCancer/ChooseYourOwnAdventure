## Description

If there was ever a creature that should not live, it is the
GONCHONG. It is a cruel, evil parasite which takes control
of the brain of its victim and uses it to commit horrendous
atrocities. It looks rather like a huge bony spider or crab, with
a pair of small, staring eyes on stalks at the front of its body.
It is physically weak, and uses its evil intelligence instead to
achieve its gruesome ends.
The thing will choose a powerful leader – a king, general or
high sorcerer–and latch on to his head by skewering a long
proboscis through the top and into the brain. This thin tube
must be severed to kill the Gonchong. However, the creature
instils great physical powers in its host (adding 5 points to
both SKILL and STAMINA), so that as the host is defending
himself, he is defending the parasitic Gonchong too. The host
of a Gonchong cannot be harmed by normal weapons: only
an enchanted fire-sword will break the parasite's defences
and injure its host. As soon as the host has been killed, the
linking proboscis must be severed while it is still stuck in the
dead creature's head. Otherwise, the foul thing will with-
draw and attempt to leap on to a new victim. Avoiding such
a move requires the target to roll his SKILL or less on two
dice.
If the Gonchong misses, it will fall to the floor, and while it
readies itself for another attempt it can be dispatched easily.
Should the thing hit its target, however, its proboscis will
puncture the new host's head while it grips with its legs. The
victim will become a soulless host for the evil Gonchong
–strong beyond belief, but condemned to a deathly existence
as its slave.
