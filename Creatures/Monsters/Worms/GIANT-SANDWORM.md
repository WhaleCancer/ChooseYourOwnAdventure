## Description

Adults have 5 Attacks

Young have 3 Attacks
The sand rises in a long line as though something were
swimming just beneath the surface. Suddenly, the sand is
broken and the GIANT SAND-WORM rears in the air, poised
to strike. Adult Sandworms can grow to twenty metres long
(young ones perhaps half that); their bodies are divided into
hundreds of segments that gradually taper towards their tails.
Their rudimentary heads are made up of a gigantic oval
mouth, lined with a ring of spiky teeth and surrounded by a
number of scent glands which enable them to detect their
prey. If an adult Sandworm scores two hits in succession on
its target, it will swallow him and he will quickly die in the
powerful digestive acids in its stomach.
The desert nomads sometimes hunt the Giant Sandworm,
using harpoons just like a whaler, while perched astride a
horse. The meat from a Sandworm is fairly edible, its teeth
can be used to make strong ivory daggers and its skin is very
tough and ideal for making tents.
