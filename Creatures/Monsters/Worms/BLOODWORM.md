The BLOODWORM is a curious creature thought to be
related to both the Mudgrinder and the Giant Sandworm,
though somewhat smaller than either of those two
22       GIANT BLOODHAWK

behemoths. Still, it grows up to eight metres long and as
thick as a man’s torso, with a segmented body that is
coloured the dirty reddish-brown hue of clotted blood.
Their grotesque head lacks eyes and instead is dominated
by a large, star-shaped suckered mouth, surrounded by
rows of sharp hooks, resembling a gigantic tapeworm in
appearance. Its name comes from its appetite for blood,
and when encountered it will lunge quickly at its victim,
attracted to the heat of their body. Anyone who fails to
dodge the Bloodworm’s lunge (by an unsuccessful Test for
Skill), or who is subsequently wounded by the creature in
combat, will lose 2 STAMINA points per Attack Round
thereafter, whether or not they win that Attack Round, as
their blood is sucked away by the giant parasite!
Adult Bloodworms are found in flooded caverns, muddy
sinkholes, and the stinking sewers of cities, but young
Bloodworms are instead found in open water, such as
shallow seas or expansive lakes. Their overall appearance
is similar to the adult form, except they are much smaller,
at around a metre in length, as thick as a man’s arm, and
they are also a vivid red in colour. Young Bloodworms,
although always hungry, lack the blood-sucking ability of
the adults, and instead attack in large packs of three to
eighteen worms. For each extra worm, add 1 STAMINA
point and 1
ATTACK (so a pack of twelve young
Bloodworms would be SKILL 4, STAMINA 12, ATTACKS 12).
After a year or so, they will migrate out of open or running
water, and into the dank habitat favoured by the adults.
Both forms are equally at home underwater however, and
will add 2 to their SKILL when fighting in such an
environment.
