## Description

Related, it is thought, to the Giant Sandworms of the Desert
of Skulls, STING WORMS are vast predatory beasts found in
isolated places across the northern lands. Their huge, seg-
mented bodies grow up to seven metres long. Their tails are
tipped with the sharp poisonous stings that give them their
name. In a fight the Sting Worm will slash and stab with this;
should it hit, the poisoned tip will cause 3 points of damage,
instead of the usual 2.
Sting Worms trap their prey by digging large pits in the
ground, with sloping sides covered in slimy secretions. Pass-
ing creatures who venture too close to the edge may lose
their footing and slip down into the creature's lair, where the
thing will attack hungrily! There may be many remnants of
the beast's past victims at the bottom of its pit. Bones will
predominate, but there may also be a few items of equip-
ment, and maybe even some treasure.
