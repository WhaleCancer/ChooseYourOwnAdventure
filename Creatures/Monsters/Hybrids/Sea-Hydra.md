## Description

The Sea Hydra is an aquatic cousin of the land-dwelling Hydra, a many-headed sea serpent that terrorizes the oceans of Titan. Like its terrestrial relative, the Sea Hydra has multiple heads rising from a single body, though it is adapted for life in the water with a streamlined, serpentine form and powerful flippers. The number of heads varies, typically between three and seven, each with its own brain and capable of independent action.

Sea Hydras are formidable predators, using their multiple heads to attack from different angles simultaneously. They are highly aggressive and will attack ships, sea creatures, and anything that enters their territory. Their massive size and multiple attacks make them extremely dangerous opponents, and they are known to drag entire ships beneath the waves. Sea Hydras typically make their lairs in underwater caves or among sunken ruins, where they guard their territory with deadly ferocity.
