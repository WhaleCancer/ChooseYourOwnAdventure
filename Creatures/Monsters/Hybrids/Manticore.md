## Description

Manticores were created centuries ago by an insane
warlock from beyond the Western Ocean, fooling with
things that should have been left well alone. Using powerful
magic, he mixed a lion, scorpion and a bat together with a
human and created the first Manticore. He repeated the
experiment many times, until he was finally killed by one of
his creations. Since then the monstrosities have scattered into
the most inhospitable parts of the world, where their evil
natures fester with hatred for all life.
A Manticore has the head of an old, bearded man, which
flows into the mane and then the body of a huge lion. From
their powerful shoulders a pair of large, leathery bat's wings
sprout, and behind them rears a scorpion-like tail tipped
with a sting the size of a man's head! They will attack with
their claws or their sting, alternately slashing and striking at
their opponent. After a successful hit, a roll of 5 or 6 on one
die indicates a hit from its poisoned sting rather than its
claws, causing 6 points of damage, unless its opponent can
avoid it by a successful Test for Luck. Their slashes will
otherwise do the usual 2 points of damage.
In a Manticore's lair there will be innumerable bones, the
sorry relics of its past victims. There may also be some
weapons, equipment or treasure, for it cannot digest such
hard items.
