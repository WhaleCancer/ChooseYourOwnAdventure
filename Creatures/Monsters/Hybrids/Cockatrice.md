## Description

The Cockatrice is a rare mythological beast much feared
by even the bravest hero. Also known as the King of Serpents
in some lands, it is a curious amalgam of a number of different
creatures. It has the head and body of a large cockerel, the
large leathery wings of a bat, and a long snake-like tail. It can
fly short distances, but will usually strut about on the ground
flapping its wings. It is carnivorous, and will fearlessly attack
any large creature it encounters.
In an attack, a Cockatrice will attempt to peck with its beak,
which will do 2 points of damage in a successful strike.
However, the beast also has poisonous breath, which will
paralyse anything it comes into contact with. If the Cockatrice
hits with its beak, two dice should be rolled to indicate which
part of its opponent's body is affected.

Anyone caught by the Cockatrice's breath has a chance of
dodging the worst of it by a successful Test for Luck: the dice
may then be rolled again and the adventurer may choose
which of the two results to apply, the other roll being ignored.
Like the Basilisk, to which it is distantly related, the
Cockatrice has a major weakness. If it catches sight of its
reflection in a mirror or some other reflective surface it will
die. Persuading a hungry Cockatrice to stop and look into a
mirror requires its opponent to Test for Luck twice. If he fails
on either roll, the Cockatrice may decide to attack while he is
occupied, scoring an automatic hit. No one is sure why the
thing can be killed in this way, but this knowledge has proved
useful to a number of lucky adventurers through the years.
