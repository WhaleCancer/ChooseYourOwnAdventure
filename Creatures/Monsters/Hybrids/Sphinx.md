## Description

The Sphinx is a legendary creature, an agent of the gods who dwells on Titan for important and esoteric reasons. It is a gigantic beast with the body of an enormous lioness, and the head of a beautiful woman, and is found dwelling in desert lands, guarding ancient ruins or crumbling pyramids. The Sphinx was venerated by the ancient Irritarian nation of Djarat and also by later civilizations, such as the Lost City of Vatos. Its image is often found carved as statues, helmets, chairs, and other forms of ornamentation. When encountered (which is extremely rare!), a Sphinx will greet its visitors cordially, but in a growling voice ask them to answer several riddles correctly to prove their worthiness (the standard number of riddles is usually three, but more or less riddles may be posed by the creature depending on its own importance and that of which it is guarding).

Those who answer the Sphinx's riddles correctly may be granted passage, knowledge, or even treasure. However, those who fail to answer correctly will face the Sphinx's wrath, as it attacks with its massive claws. The Sphinx is highly intelligent and possesses ancient knowledge, making it both a dangerous guardian and a potential source of wisdom for those brave and clever enough to pass its tests.
