## Description

From a distance it could be a large lizard, two metres from
snout to tail, and coloured a mottled sandy-brown. Those
innocent or foolish adventurers who want to get closer will
notice that the creature's head is rather bird-like and is tilted
from side to side as it tentatively sniffs the air. For one brief
moment, they may take in the fact that its eyes are large and
yellow, almost like a frog's, before the gaze of the Basilisk
turns them to stone.
These legendary beasts kill by catching the gaze of their victim
and petrifying them. An opponent needs to Test for Luck
successfully in order to cover his eyes in time and avert his
gaze. Attacking the creature by slashing a weapon at it
without looking is just as perilous, for its poisonous breath
will kill instantly! However, a Basilisk's gaze is as harmful to
itself as it is to other living things. Should it catch sight of its
eyes in a mirror or some other reflective device, it will turn
itself to stone, hardening from living flesh to dead rock in an
instant.
