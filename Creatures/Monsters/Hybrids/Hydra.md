## Description

The Hydra is a many-headed creature which can unfortu-
nately be found in many different types of terrain. Though
they are rare, they often figure as the villains of heroic tales.
They are reptilian creatures, like fat-bodied snakes, with a
number of large heads rising on long necks from their bod-
ies. The number of heads can be found by rolling one die and
adding one, to give the beast between two and seven wide-
mouthed, fang-filled heads. A Hydra has as many Attacks as
it has heads. Covered in green-brown scales, but usually
dripping mud and slime, the nightmarish beasts can grow as
much as ten metres long.
Each head has its own brain and can attack separately. In a
fight, its opponent can engage one head while defending
against the others, each of which has a separate Attack Roll.
If its opponent wishes, he can concentrate on attacking the
thing's body to kill it outright. He can deliver one automatic
hit each round, while defending against all of the heads.
Once its body is dead, the heads will also die, flopping to the
ground on limp necks.
