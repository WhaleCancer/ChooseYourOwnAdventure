## Description

Should you meet the Manticore,
Of its tail beware.
Shield yourself against the spikes
Flying through the air.
- Ancient Khulian Nursery Rhyme
Unlike the scorpion-tailed Manticores of Allansia and the
Old World, the Chaos Manticore of Khul is a far
stranger adversary. While it has a lion's body with mottled
black fur, huge leathery dragon-like wings, and a
disturbingly human-like head, its tail is radically different,
being green and scaly, and covered in a profusion of long,
iron-hard spikes. These can be fired at the Chaos Manticore's opponents in a manner similar to crossbow
bolts; roll one die to determine the number of spikes that
have hit the creature’s victim and deduct two STAMINA
points for each spike that hits. If the victim has a shield,
they can roll a die to see how many spikes are blocked by
the shield (which will be destroyed in the attack); excess
spikes not blocked by the shield will strike the victim as
above. Should the victim survive this barrage of spikes,
the Chaos Manticore will then attack with claws and fangs,
seeking to rend its prey apart and feast upon the remains.
Chaos Manticores lurk in the desolate badlands of central
Khul such as the Wastes of Chaos, the Deadlands, and the
Scythera Desert. They will usually make their lair in a ruin
or cave and prey on travelling merchant caravans, herds
of goats and camels, and whatever else is unfortunate
enough to cross their territory. Despite their name, Chaos
Manticores were not created during the relatively recent
Great War Against Evil, but are thought to have origins
stretching back to just after the Splitting of the Lands. The
exact reason for why they are so different to Manticores
elsewhere in terms of tail anatomy is unknown however.
This of course didn’t stop Baron Sukumvit from capturing
and importing a Chaos Manticore for the first incarnation
of his Deathtrap Dungeon, to better surprise careless
adventurers more familiar with the rather different sting-
tailed Manticores that lurk in the wilds of Allansia!
