## Description

The Ophidiotaur is a strange hybrid creature found in the deep forests and jungles of Titan, combining features of a snake and a centaur. It has the upper body of a large serpent with a humanoid torso, and the lower body of a powerful snake-like tail. The creature's head is distinctly serpentine, with large fangs and intelligent eyes, while its upper body has two arms ending in sharp claws. Its heavy scales provide excellent protection, and it attacks with both its venomous bite and its powerful constricting tail.

Ophidiotaurs are typically neutral creatures, not immediately hostile unless threatened. They are intelligent enough to communicate, though they rarely choose to do so with non-serpentine races. These creatures are territorial and will defend their hunting grounds, but they are not inherently evil and may sometimes be reasoned with by those who approach them with respect and caution.
