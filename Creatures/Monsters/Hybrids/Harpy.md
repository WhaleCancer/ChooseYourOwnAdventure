## Description

Legends have long talked of the Harpies, foul winged
creatures that terrorize travellers in desolate lands. They are
roughly humanoid with ugly, over-large heads and thin
stunted bodies. Stretched between their limbs are vast leath-
ery wings which make them look like human bats! Their feet
are birdlike and end in large pointed claws. The vile things
delight in tormenting lone travellers and adventurers,
swooping down from the sky, cawing and screeching, to
buffet them with their wings and slash them with their
claws. They appear to have an almost limitless capacity for
tormenting their victims, but eventually they will tire of their
game and finish them off, before dividing up the bodies and
flying off to eat in their lairs (usually a cave or ledge high up
a cliff from where they can see a potential plaything kilome-
tres away).
