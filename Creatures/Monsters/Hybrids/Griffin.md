### Description

Sometimes spelled Griffon, or even Gryphon, the Griffin is a legendary beast with the head and wings of a great eagle and the body of lion. Thought to be the offspring of a son of Rogaar the Lion God and a daughter of the avian deity known as the Hawklord, they are rare but widely distributed across Titan.

Griffins usually nest in mountainous areas, making their eyrie atop a rocky crag from which they can spy out prey from far off. Horse flesh is their favoured food, but they will eat any kind of meat when hungry, diving down from the sky to tear their victim apart with razor-sharp claws and a savage, hooked beak.

Griffins are commonly depicted in statuary or heraldry (such as Ruddlestone's legendary Griffin Shield of the Templar Knights of Telak), and they are known to make loyal yet aggressive steeds if raised from the egg as a hatchling. People as diverse as the Barbarians of the Moonstone Hills and the mercenary warriors of the Giant overlord Kuperan of central Khul are all known to favour Griffins as battle-mounts. As a result, Griffin eggs may sell for several hundred Gold Pieces in the bazaar of a very large city, but actually stealing these eggs from the nest of such a beast is another matter altogether!

## War Griffin (Tooki)

### Statistics

- **SKILL:** 11 (estimated, larger and more powerful than standard Griffin)
- **STAMINA:** 12 (estimated, larger and more powerful than standard Griffin)
- **ATTACKS:** 2
- **WEAPON:** Large Claw and Large Bite

- **NUMBER ENCOUNTERED:** 1 or in groups (aerial forces)

- **INTELLIGENCE:** Average (but more aggressive)

### Description

In some parts of Allansia, Griffins have been bred into a special race known as the War Griffin or Tooki. These are much larger than their wild cousins and more powerful and ferocious as well. War Griffins are also somewhat darker in hue, with shorter feathers and fur to increase the speed with which they swoop through the air.

They were first thought to have been bred by an ancient Dwarf king of the stone cliff-city of Warpstone, for scouting out and dealing with the predations of Hill Trolls and Flatland Nomads. Although their intelligence and aggression makes training them a lengthy process, War Griffins can be sometimes found among the retinues of warlords and wizards across Allansia.

The evil sorcerer Xortan Throg was known to keep a War Griffin, which he used to kidnap the Princess Sarissa in a bid to foment war between the kingdoms of Salamonis and Chalice. Mightier still was the necromancer Zharradan Marr who personally commanded an aerial force of at least a dozen Tooki, all ridden by elite Blood Orc archers. Prior to the Trolltooth Wars, Marr used his War Griffins to capture the mighty flying ship known as the Galleykeep, though some say in doing so he sowed the seeds of his own eventual destruction.
