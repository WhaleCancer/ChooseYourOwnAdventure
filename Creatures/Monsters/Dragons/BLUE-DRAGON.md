BLUE DRAGONS are thought to have been a gift given
back in the Godtime from Kilanirax the Dragon King to
Sukh the Storm God. As a result, because these great
reptiles now pay fealty to Sukh, they can no longer be a
part of the Conclave of Dragons. They are mighty and
majestic creatures, being second only to the Gold Dragons
in size, and covered in a gleaming array of iridescent blue
scales. Blue Dragons are exceptionally rare beasts and only
found in the most isolated of places, from lonely
mountain-tops to crumbling ruins in the trackless depths
of arid deserts. Here they will brood atop a pile of gold
coins and jewels, nurturing a fierce hatred of all other
dragonkind for exiling them from the Conclave. Some
Blue Dragons even take things a step further, and ally
themselves with the local despot or warlord to further
emphasize their renegade nature; tales tell of the Giant
overlord Kuperan of central Khul who spectacularly rode
an adult Blue Dragon into battle against his foes!
In combat, Blue Dragons will usually use their cruel talons
and toothy jaws to tear their enemies apart. However, and
perhaps fittingly given they are boon companions to Sukh
the Storm God, Blue Dragons can breathe a lightning bolt
every other Attack Round, blasting a single foe with a
coruscating mass of electrical energy. This requires a
successful Test for Luck to avoid; Unlucky victims will
suffer 3 STAMINA points damage (or 6 STAMINA points
damage if hit by an adult Blue Dragon). In addition, if the
victim is wearing either chainmail or plate armour, then
all damage caused by the lightning bolt will be doubled,
as the metal armour strengthens the shock of the attack.
