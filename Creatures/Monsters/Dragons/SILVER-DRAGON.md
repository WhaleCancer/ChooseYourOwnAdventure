## Description

SILVER DRAGONS have long been the archenemies of their
Gold cousins, for they are very jealous of their status among
the rest of Dragon-kind. They seem to be perpetually plot-
ting against their noble relations, though events rarely get
violent. Silver Dragons live in desolate areas away from
other creatures, for they can be bad-tempered and aggressive.
In an attack a Silver Dragon can shoot out a chilling sheet of
cold that is wide enough to hit two opponents at once. Unless
its targets can roll their current SKILL score or less on two
dice, they will lose 2 STAMINA points (4 from an adult
Dragon). The creatures can breathe cold once every three
Attack Rounds. Silver Dragons fear fire, though, and would
rather give away part of their vast treasure-hoard than face

several creatures wielding it against them.
