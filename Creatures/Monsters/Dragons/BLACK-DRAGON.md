## Description

BLACK DRAGONS are usually encountered in rough, hilly
terrain, where they may be preying upon villages for their
livestock or people. Both young and adult Black Dragons
make their lairs in caverns, to which they will return after a
day's hunting. Younger creatures will have only a small,

cramped cave, but an adult may occupy a vast cavern com-
plex, housing a tribe of Goblins or Ores as well as various
other monsters, with several secret entrances for when dan-
ger threatens.
A Black Dragon's breath is unusual in that instead of the
typical jet of flame, it can create a huge stinking cloud of
poisonous gas. Young creatures can create one up to three
metres in diameter, an adult twice that. Anyone caught
within the cloud must successfully Test for Luck or lose 4
take a single point of damage. A young Black Dragon can
produce such a cloud only once every six Attack Rounds; an
adult once every four rounds.
