## Description

A young Green Dragon may be encountered amid the tangles at the centre of a large forest, where it will make its lair in an old ruin or a shallow cave in a hillside. An adult creature will only be encountered deep in a tropical jungle, well away from any settlements, where it can enjoy being the largest and most voracious predator in the region. Green Dragons are natural hunters, both quick and cunning, and make fearsome opponents.

## Special Abilities

**Fire Breath:** In combat they can breathe out a thin stream of fire once every three Attack Rounds. If their opponent fails to roll his current SKILL or under on two dice, he will be burnt for 2 STAMINA points of damage (4 points from an adult creature).
