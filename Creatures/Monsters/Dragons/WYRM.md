## Description

WYRMS (also called Worms in some parts of the world) are
solitary beasts thought to be related to Dragons. There are
many similarities between the two races. Both have lizard-
like heads and leathery wings. They can both live to a great
age and are highly intelligent. But Wyrms are thin and
snakelike, without legs and feet, and cannot actually fly.
These great white beasts dwell in icy regions where their
colouring allows them to blend with their background. Their
usual method of attack is to rear up on their coils, wings
outstretched for balance, and blast their victim with their icy
breath. This requires a successful Test for Luck, or the adven-
turer must suffer 5 points of damage. This breath can only be
used once every three Attack Rounds. They can also bite
their prey, but prefer to use their breath weapon as much as
possible. They are cumbersome beasts and move only clum-
sily in combat. Their great enemies are White Dragons, with
whom they often have to compete for food. Many fierce
battles, unknown to man, rage in the blizzards, as two great
beasts fight to the death over a scrap of food.
