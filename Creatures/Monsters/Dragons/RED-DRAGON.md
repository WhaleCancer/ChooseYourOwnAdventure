## Description

Red Dragons are hoarders who relish collecting coins, jewels and all other valuable items. When encountered, a Red Dragon will usually be in its cavern, sprawled across the top of a large pile of treasure. Red Dragons are automatically suspicious of anyone they encounter, believing them to be thieves intent on stealing their treasure, and will attack them immediately.

## Special Abilities

**Fire-Ball:** Red Dragons can shoot fire-balls from their mouths, which they send roaring through the air to explode on their target. These can be avoided by a successful Test for Luck; if they hit they will cause 2 STAMINA points of damage (4 from an adult Red Dragon). The creatures can produce one of these every other round, and can shoot them up to twenty-five metres with surprising accuracy.
