## Description

The largest and noblest of all their race, GOLD DRAGONS
are only rarely encountered by humans. They prefer to in-
habit large towers or castles in the middle of deserts or at the
top of mountains, well removed from most other creatures.
They are better disposed towards humans than other Drag-
ons, though they cannot understand that their short life-span
makes them seem impatient and rude. Gold Dragons tend to
be especially friendly with sages and sorcerers, who some-
times visit them with questions on ancient history or magic.
The Dragons dislike the more primitive and violent human-
oid races, though, and will normally attack them on sight.
Gold Dragons can breathe a wide jet of flame every other
Attack Round. This is broad enough to hit two opponents,
and requires a Test for Luck to avoid it. It will scorch away 2
STAMINA points if it hits (an adult's will cause 4 points of
damage). Creatures aged more than about seventy years
may also have magical spells to back up their claws and
teeth; they are particularly fond of illusions and tricks. The
armoured hide of a Gold Dragon is very tough, and blows
against it will only cause 1 point of damage to the huge
creature.
