## Description

Of all the desolate, inhospitable places that Dragons inhabit, nowhere is worse than that of the White Dragons. They can only survive in sub-zero temperatures, so they will only ever be encountered amid the snow and ice of the extreme northern lands, beyond the Icefinger Mountains. They dwell in vast caves or castles carved from the ice itself. They are the most unpredictable of all Dragons, and will normally eat any being they come across.

A White Dragon will not eat its dead prey straight away. Sometimes, especially when the long northern winter draws near, they will leave the bodies inside large blocks of ice, to keep until other food is scarce, when they will claw them out and eat them!

## Special Abilities

**Ice Breath:** In keeping with its frigid home, a White Dragon can breathe out a stream of ice that will freeze its opponent. This will hit its target on a roll of 1 or 2 on one die, causing an extra 3 points of damage (5 if the Dragon is an adult).
