## Description

Alongside the majestic Dragons, there is another race of
lesser flying creatures, known as WYVERNS. They grow at
the most to ten metres long, but otherwise look very similar
to Dragons, except that they have only two legs. This makes
them look more like scaly birds than winged lizards.
They are typically coloured green or brown, with lighter
undersides; their eyes are red, ever glinting with malevolent
cunning.
Like their larger cousins, Wyverns can breathe fire from their
mouths, though more as a short burst than a continuous
stream of flame. Anyone finding himself under attack from
a fire-breathing Wyvern must successfully Test for Luck, or
be singed for 4 STAMINA points of damage. The great beast
will then land and attack with its huge claws and fangs, and
drag the corpse into its lair to be consumed.
