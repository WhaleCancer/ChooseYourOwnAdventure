## Description

In the time of legends, Rogaar the Lord of Lions took as his
mate a beautiful Golden Dragon called Chrysolla. Their
offspring were numerous, and still exist today - the
DRACONS. The creatures are large, almost six metres long
and standing as tall as a man. They have the bodies of
enormous lions, with huge clawed feet. Their heads are large
and leonine, with the exquisite eyes and ferocious teeth of a

dragon. Their manes shimmer like a shower of molten gold,
and their bodies are sleek and powerful. They can fly short
distances with the help of the pair of small wings which
sprout from their shoulders.
Dracons are rarely seen by men, as they prefer to dwell in
desolate, forgotten places – old ruins, abandoned caves and
the like. They are proud, rather haughty beasts, as befits their
heritage, and are only too willing to expound all the intricate
details of their distant family trees to anyone willing to listen
to them. They are very fastidious about good manners, and
can quickly become irate if their guests turn out to be rude
and boorish in their behavior. In an attack they will either
slash with their claws or bite with their oversized teeth.
Throughout a fight, they will mock their opponents, derid-
ing their skill, abusing their parents and family, and cursing
any successful blows. Should they be overwhelmed, they
will attempt to escape rather than die. If flight proves impos-
sible, they may offer some items from their large but well-
hidden treasure-hoards in return for their lives. An honour-
able adventurer can often bargain his way to a choice trea-
sure; a greedy or dishonest man may be passed a cursed item
for his rudeness: Dracons are obsessed with manners, in
even the most desperate circumstances.
