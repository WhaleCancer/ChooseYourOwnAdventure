During the Godtime, Hydana the Sea God’s penchant for
abducting land beings and using them to populate his
undersea realm resulted in many aquatic races such as the
Sea Elves and Merfolk, but perhaps his greatest
achievement was creating the reptilian beasts known as
SEA DRAGONS. These are long, serpentine creatures,
covered in blue-green scales and serried spikes, with
gaping jaws and cannonball-sized eyes. Sea Dragons lack
both forelimbs and wings, having instead a pair of wide,
razor-sharp fins they use for swimming, along with
powerful back legs that bear ivory-coloured talons. They
are widespread across the seas and oceans of Titan; for
example, one is known to make its home among the
sunken ruins of Atlantis, and they are also found in the
monster-haunted Eelsea, off the western coast of
Femphrey and Gallantaria. There is even an enormous
statue of a Sea Dragon in the Enchanted Garden of the
Scarlet Pagoda, somewhere in the misty hinterland of
Hachiman, that is rumoured to occasionally come to life
and devour all around it!
It is erroneously believed that Sea Dragons do not have a
breath weapon like their land-based counterparts, but this
only applies if the beast is encountered underwater, where
the effects of its breath weapon are negligible. If however,
it is fought on the seashore, or above the surface, the Sea
Dragon will vomit forth a cascading wave of boiling sea
water at its opponents, once only, at the start of combat.
This steaming torrent can hit up to six opponents at the
same time and requires a Test for Skill to avoid;
unsuccessful victims will lose 3 STAMINA points (or 6
STAMINA points if breathed on by an adult Sea Dragon).
Unsurprisingly, this is the Dragon’s favoured attack when
preying on local shipping, for they are highly avaricious
creatures and delight in wrecking and looting the ships of
both merchants and pirates alike, to add to their ever-
growing treasure hoard. Sea Dragons typically make their
lair in a dark cavern on the sea floor, and it is rumoured
that enterprising adventurers who somehow reach the
creature’s home can make an agreement to summon the
Sea Dragon’s aid by clinking together 2 Gold Pieces three
times, and then three times again. Such pacts are not to be
entered into lightly however, for Sea Dragons are
treacherous monsters and think nothing of breaking an
agreement to devour their summoner should the
opportunity present itself.
