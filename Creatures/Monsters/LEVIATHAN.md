## Description

Largest of all the Sea Serpents and found dwelling

across the seas and oceans of Titan is the immense

brute known as the LEVIATHAN. This is a long

sinuous beast

over twenty

metres long,

with

reddish scaly skin and a serpentine body. The

Leviathan’s head is huge and dragon-like, with

wide jaws full of teeth. It prefers to feed on whales

and large sharks but is not averse to erupting from

the water to a;ack boats and ships, roaring at their

terrified sailors and covering them with drool and

bits of semi-digested fish. If the Leviathan rolls a

double six for its A;ack Strength in combat, it has

swallowed

its

victim

whole.
