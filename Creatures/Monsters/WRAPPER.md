## Description

The WRAPPER is a strange, dungeon-dwelling monster that
lurks in the shadows of the underworld waiting for foolhar-
dy adventurers and unwary creatures to stumble into its lair
for dinner. It is large and black, and resembles a cross be-
tween a cloak and a thick blanket. Its body is wide and
leathery; its head hangs between its shoulders, down inside
the span of its wings, and it has evil red eyes, a wide, fang-
filled mouth and skeletal claws.
Wrappers can fly, gliding almost silently through the dark-
ness, guided by echoes from the walls picked up by two
sensitive pits above their eyes, and balanced by their long,
thin tails. They can also crawl along floors and across walls
using their claws, but only very slowly. Wrappers have an
incredible sense of hearing, which picks up vibrations in the
ground and walls as well as audible sound. They wait mo-
tionless for their prey, often flattening themselves against the
ceiling or wall, so as to be all but undetectable. The Wrapper
then launches itself at its victim, enfolds it in its cloak-like
wings, and bites deeply into its back.
To avoid the initial attack, an adventurer must Test for Luck
twice (once to notice the Wrapper and a second time to avoid
it). If he fails, the Wrapper will gain one automatic hit (taking
the usual 2 STAMINA points). Once lodged on a victim's
back, the Wrapper is much harder to hit–reduce SKILL by 3
for the duration of the fight. However, hitting the beast with
fire, such as a burning torch, will cause it to relinquish its
hold and fall to the floor, where it can be dispatched by a
single successful hit.
A Wrapper's lair will contain the skeletons of many of its
previous victims, together with many fine items of treasure,
looted from the adventurers who have previously served as
dinner.
