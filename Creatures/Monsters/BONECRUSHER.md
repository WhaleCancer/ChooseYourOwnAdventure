Down in the subterranean depths lurk the hideous yet
immensely powerful beasts called BONECRUSHERS,
slowly shuffling through dark tunnels and caverns in their
eternal quest for victims. They are mighty creatures, taller
than a man and covered in thick, leathery, iron-hard hide,
with an incredibly muscular torso and strong forearms
that end in taloned paws. Its clawed legs look stunted in
comparison, though they balance the Bonecrusher with
the help of a thick tail that drags along the ground behind
the creature as it walks. The head is small and ugly, with
tiny near-blind eyes, a flat nose and a mass of writhing
tendrils that overhang its wide mouth. The tendrils are
the Bonecrusher’s main sensory organ, constantly sniffing
and tasting the air around it, and the scholar Aspartis
considers this evidence that the beast is related to the
similarly tentacled Brain Slayer, perhaps as an associated
guard or warrior race.
The creature’s fearsome reputation is due to its lethal
arms. Anyone who loses an Attack Round to a
Bonecrusher will be instantly killed as one clawed paw

grabs and breaks one or both of their arms while the other
snaps their neck! Instead, a better tactic is to catch the
creature in a weighted net and pull it to the ground,
whereupon its sense of balance is destroyed and it will be
unable to rise owing to its immense weight. To do this
requires a successful Test for Skill to see if the beast is
caught in the net; failure indicates the net-bearer must Test
for Skill again to avoid the Bonecrusher’s lethal attack,
before readying their net for another attempt. The
Bonecrusher makes for a spectacular addition to any
arena, and thus the wise gladiator should always consider
the weighted net and an accompanying trident as a
necessary part of his or her arsenal. Indeed, the Maze of
the Bogomil in the strange and wild kingdom of Kazan is
positively infested with Bonecrushers, though many of
these are immature young, who lack the killer forearms
of the adult form and will instead settle for raking their
opponent with their claws.
