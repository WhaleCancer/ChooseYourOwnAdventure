## Description

In apparent defiance of all natural laws, the EYE STINGER
floats up to a metre above the ground. It is large, spherical
and covered with long, poisonous spines. In the centre of its
dark green, scaly skin there is a huge staring eye. Anyone
encountering an Eye Stinger must successfully Test for Luck
or be entranced by the eye, and stand slackly as the thing
approaches to impale them on its spines. Its poison will not
kill them, but just paralyse, leaving the creature or person at
the mercy of other creatures. The Eye Stinger will then scav-
enge any scraps left over.
The hypnotic gaze of an Eye Stinger is very powerful, but it
can be disrupted by a pure black object, such as a piece of
polished onyx or jet. If it sees such an object, its eye will be
confused and will close, allowing its victim to escape.
Anyone striking the creature will be in for a surprise, for the
things are mostly full of a sticky liquid which gives off the
gas that enables them to 'fly'. When hit, they will burst and
splatter everyone fighting them with the acidic liquid, caus-
ing 2 points of damage to each person's STAMINA.
