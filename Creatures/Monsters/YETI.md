## Description

In the desolate mountainous wastes of northern Allansia,
where the snow falls thick and the wind cuts like an icy
dagger, hunters huddle around their campfires and speak in
hushed, fearful voices of the YETI. Their folk-tales say that
long ago they were the rulers of this craggy, inhospitable
land. With the coming of man and dreaded fire, the beasts
retired to the higher slopes, emerging only occasionally to
prey on men.
Standing more than four metres tall when rearing fully up-
right, these huge monsters are covered in masses of thick
white fur, a pelt most prized by native hunters. Like a cross
between the most savage of Apes and the most fearsome of
Bears, they are equipped for hunting with a mouth brim-
ming with sharp tusks and razor-like teeth, and paws fulls of
claws each as long as a man's hand! Furthermore, their touch
imparts a freezing chill that will do an additional die of
STAMINA damage each time it scores a successful hit. These
massive beasts are not very intelligent, but have an animal's
cunning in silently tracking their prey by scent alone. They
will follow an unwary man for days before choosing to
strike, and when the hunter becomes the hunted there is little
chance of escape! Unlike most of the mountain creatures,
Yeti hibernate for only the harshest of the winter months, for
they can stand all but the worst blizzards in their relentless
hunt for food. When even foolhardy man stays indoors and
only the inedible Toa-Suo roam abroad, they will take moun-
tain goats and deer, but when even these become scarce they
will descend the slopes and attack isolated huts. They are
feared by all men, even those who take their lives in their
hands to hunt these terrifying carnivores.
