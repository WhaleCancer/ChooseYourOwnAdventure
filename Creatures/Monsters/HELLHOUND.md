## Description

Many Demon Princes like to keep pets. Sith, a noxious Snake
Demon, has a python twenty metres long and a metre thick.
Some of the more sophisticated Princes, however, keep a
pack of HELLHOUNDS. The huge dogs are bad-tempered
and violent, and therefore make wonderful pets for the vile

Demon Princes, who use them in the Wild Hunt, when all the
Princes of Hell chase across the Earthly Plane in search of
errant human souls.
The beasts are huge, midnight-black dogs, about the size of
a Wolf, with black teeth and tongues, and brilliant red eyes.
Their bite would be savage enough, but they can also shoot
bursts of fire from their mouths. As well as their usual attack,
each round the flames will singe their opponent on a roll of
1 or 2 (on one die) for a further 1 point of damage. They can
even claw at one opponent and breathe gouts of flame at
another.
Hellhounds are usually confined to the Demonic Plane.
Some evil sorcerers have managed to summon them to the
Earthly Plane, but the beasts are usually too savage to be
kept as anything except guard-dogs, roaming empty rooms
for intruders to stumble upon.
