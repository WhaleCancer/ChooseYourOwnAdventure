## Description

The CRADOC is yet another mutant horror that

plagues the Chaos-tainted lands of Khul, the Dark

Continent. It typically lurks in blasted heathlands,

misty swamps, and dusty steppes, from whence it

shambles forth to track and consume prey. From a

distance, the Cradoc resembles a giant flesh-eating

dinosaur or a malformed lizard, albeit one with

purple-striped pink hide, and not one but two

heads. One head is that of a savage Ogre, and the

other is of a flame-breathing dragon. In combat, the

Cradoc will a;ack with claws and bites, and also

with bolts of fire from its Dragon head. These will

burn one opponent each round on a roll of 1 or 2 on

one die for 2 STAMINA points of damage.
