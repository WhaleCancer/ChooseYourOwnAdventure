## Description

IRON-EATERS are strange, jelly-like creatures, rather like
giant amoebas, which surprise many adventurers by drop-
ping on to them from ceilings and overhangs. If its victim is
unaware of it, the thing will land on him on a roll of 1-5 on
one die. Otherwise, a normal Attack Round should be rolled.
If the Iron-Eater hits successfully, it has landed; if not, it has
missed, and can be finished off in one blow on the floor.

Once the creature has struck, it will start to feed, not on flesh,
but on the metal of a helmet or breastplate! The strange beast
will chew large holes in the armour, removing 1 SKILL point
for each item (helmet, shield, breastplate, etc.) that it eats. A
normal Attack must then be rolled to remove the Iron-Eater;
if the beast wins, it has clung on to its opponent and will
destroy another item. If it loses, it will be injured as normal,
and will drop to the floor, where it can be finished off.
