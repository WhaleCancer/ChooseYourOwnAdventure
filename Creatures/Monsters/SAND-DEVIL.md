## Description

The sufi (or holy men) of the nomadic tribes of the Desert of
Skulls tell many tales of the mysterious SAND DEVILS.
Encountered only rarely in the sands of the vast desert wastes,
they appear as dense, swirling spirals, shifting and dancing
in the heat. They are solitary creatures, but occasionally serve,
for the sake of mutual friendship, as lookouts and magical
familiars for desert Elves, feeding off the energy cast in their
ritual spells.
Sand Devils appear to be Wardens over the desert in much
the same way that druids care for plants and forests. As a
result, they are very territorial, and will try to keep all
trespassers away from the areas they care for. They will rise
out of the dunes, swirling angrily at the transgressors of their
sacred reaches, spitting sand and dust into the air. They fight
by enveloping their opponents in abrasive sand, which stings
and cuts into flesh, cloth and even metal.

Their shifting, insubstantial forms are difficult to strike with
any great force; any hit on a Sand Devil will do only a single
point of damage.
Water, if thrown over a Sand Devil in sufficient quantity, acts
as a virulent poison, and will kill it in minutes. In the rare
cloudbursts that bring much-needed water to the parched
desert, the creature burrows deep into the dunes, mingling
with the sand until the fatal rain passes by.
