## Description

Scuttling around their darkened caves in search of tasty
morsels, GRANNITS are surprisingly ferocious little horrors.
About the size of a coconut, they are covered in armadillo-
like bony armour that blends well with their surroundings
and makes stationary Grannits indistinguishable from the
rocks and stones around them. This camouflage allows them
to surprise their prey as they suddenly scurry on eight tiny
legs and sink their teeth into exposed flesh. This first attack
inevitably causes 1 point of STAMINA damage to their prey;
after this they can be fought normally.
