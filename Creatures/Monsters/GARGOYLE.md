## Description

GARGOYLES are ferocious beasts, whose ability to blend
with the surrounding rock is such that they will surprise a
prey 5 times out of 6, and be able to deliver their first blow
automatically. They are roughly humanoid in shape, with
clawed hands and feet, and bestial heads brimming with
teeth and horns. A pair of large leathery wings sprouts from
their backs, and a point-tipped tail hangs behind. They are

coloured a mottled grey that looks just like stone. This cam-
ouflage allows them to play their favourite trick on an ad-
venturer – standing motionless on a piece of stone and
pretending to be a statue until they can strike.
The stony hide of a Gargoyle is tough: normal weapons
cannot injure them. In fact, two blows on a Gargoyle are
enough to break even the strongest of swords. Enchanted
magical weapons can injure them, however, and they will
also retreat from fire. It is rumoured that the Gargoyles pay
fealty, in both service and treasure, to the evil Night Demon
Vradna, who is said to be served by a legion of a thousand of
the foul creatures.
