## Description

The SLYKK are a race of small and slimy frog-like amphibi-
ans which dwell in many places across Allansia and else-
where. They need to live close to water, and can be found in
marshland, rivers and damp caves – anywhere they can keep
their skins moist and slimy. Slykk stand on their hind feet,
and can grasp with their hands, but they still bear a marked
resemblance to their frog ancestors. They communicate in
patterns of stilted croaks, and have powerful legs and
webbed feet for swimming. Their tongues are prehensile,
and they can use them to snatch small water creatures to eat,
though they are useless against larger beings.
Slykk live in different tribes, each with its own distinguish-
ing patterns and colours, which range from green and yellow
to brown and black. The tribes are always feuding with one
another, for a variety of petty reasons incomprehensible to
nonSlykk. Warriors can sometimes be encountered on pa-
trols on the edge of their territory, carrying crude spears and
swords. Their inability to unite into one race has proved very
costly to the Slykk, and the weakened tribes suffer badly
from the ravages of many predators, including Giant Leech-
es and Kokomokoa. The tribes are ruled over by strong,
over-proud chieftains, who often parade in their finery, dec-
orated with jewels and gold stolen from human adventurers
who have been caught up in one of their interminable civil
wars.
