## Description

In the heart of the Desert of Skulls all kinds of strange beasts
dwell, encountered but rarely by men; the FIEND is one such
creature. A remnant from an earlier civilization that colo-
nized the fringes of the desert, it lurks among old ruins,
perhaps awaiting the return of its long-dead masters. As tall
as man, they are tough, sinewy humanoids, covered in leath-
ery red skin. As well as sharp claws and teeth, they have a
pair of horns which sprout from their savage-looking heads.
In an attack they will slash about with their claws, and then
catch their opponent unawares by breathing a blast of fire
straight at him! Hitting on a roll of 1 or 2 on one die, it will
cause an additional 1 point of damage. Should it slay its
opponent, the Fiend will breathe on it a little more, before
feasting on the succulent roasted flesh. Fiends will often be
found watching over hoards of priceless ancient artefacts, or
perhaps even the tombs of their ancient masters.
