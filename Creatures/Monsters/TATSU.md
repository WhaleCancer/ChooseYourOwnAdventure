The TATSU is a strange type of wingless Dragon that
nevertheless has the magical ability to fly through the air.
It has a long sinuous body, like a massive serpent but with
four clawed legs. The Tatsu’s head is adorned with spikes
and horns and dominated by its great, glaring amber eyes.
Its body is covered with thick iridescent scales that
shimmer in silver, gold, scarlet and emerald hues. They
are found in isolated areas of the kingdom of Hachiman,
such as the depths of the Forest of Shadows, or atop the
peaks of the Shios’ii Mountains. Some Tatsu have been
found further abroad, in the wastes surrounding the
city-state of Zamarra, or the mysterious mountains known
as the Anvils of the Gods in the far south of the Old World.
There are Lesser and Greater varieties of Tatsu, with the
former marginally more numerous than the latter, but
both are extremely rare.
The Tatsu is a very intelligent creature and will claim to
be bound by celestial laws of conduct when it encounters
someone travelling through its domain. This will usually
resolve itself as a game of chance or a riddling contest, and
if the wayfarer wins the competition they will receive safe
passage. However, should they lose, the Tatsu will leap
upon them and devour them with its mouth full of great
ivory fangs. They can also breath out a blast of flame every
other Attack Round, which require a successful Test for
Skill to avoid. If the victim is unsuccessful, they are badly
burned for 4 STAMINA points of damage (or 6 STAMINA
points of damage if attacked by a Greater Tatsu).
Some Tatsu are even known to use magical spells,
summoning up illusory warriors to defend their lair, or
call forth great storms to rain lightning bolts down upon
their enemies. These powers, together with their innate
flying ability despite lacking wings, are created by an
enchanted pearl embedded deep within their skull.
Indeed, incredible gifts are said to be granted to those who
can slay a Tatsu and ingest such a pearl; such artefacts are
all but priceless and only owned by the most powerful
emperors and archmagi. More common are jade charms
sculpted in the shape of a Tatsu, which are known as
Talismans of Fortuitous Circumstances, and grant a boon
of 2 extra LUCK points to all who wear them. These amulets
are sometimes given to those to help a Tatsu, perhaps by
slaying a troublesome Sturramak, whom they are known
to loath with a passion!
