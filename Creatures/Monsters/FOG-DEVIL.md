## Description

When the mists of winter descend on the tangled hearts of
forests, the FOG DEVILS gather amid the trees to hunt and
play. Streaming through the trees, howling and screaming
like demented Wolves, they roam in search of Woodlings or

Gnomes to feast upon.
These strange and savage monsters appear as ghostly, bil-
lowing concentrations of vapour formed into vaguely hu-
man shapes. Their heads have the most definition; from here
their bodies gradually trail away into nothingness and
merge with the mist. Their faces are misshapen, nightmarish
parodies of a human visage, with insane eyes and a fang-
filled slash of a mouth. Their arms appear to be strong and
muscular, ending in three-fingered hands which can rend a
man in two with a single slash. In an attack, a swirling Fog
Devil will spin around an opponent in a confusing spiral of
mist that suddenly sprouts claws and teeth. Anyone attacked
by such a creature will fight it with their SKILL reduced by 2
for the duration of the encounter. Should the creatures kill
their opponent, they will stop briefly to nibble on the choic-
est parts, before swirling on.
Thankfully for the other denizens of the forests, these savage,
evil beings are very rare, and will only be encountered when
the thickest winter fogs are in the air. For the rest of the time,
the Fog Devils hibernate in the boles of trees and forgotten
animal burrows, waiting for the mists to come again.
