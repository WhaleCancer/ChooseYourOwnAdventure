## Description

The Dark Continent of Khul has a reputation for being home to some peculiar creatures and surely one of the strangest looking is the immense GROUNDHOG. These enormous monsters will lie in wait for prey in some secluded spot, looking like an oversized boulder or a great slab of rock. When a victim wanders close by, the Groundhog will rise up on eight stumpy yet powerful legs, while a huge, slit-like mouth full of curved fangs will open in the centre of the creature's broad back. All along the edges of the back will be writhing tentacles, tipped with balls of bone that extrude themselves from the Groundhog's body and beat at their prey like living morning stars! Once they have subdued their prey, the tentacles will transport its body to the central mouth.
