## Description

One of the biggest dangers in the caves and caverns of Titan is the profusion of creatures that lurk up amidst the stalactites, ready to drop down onto any unwary prey below. Not all of these horrors seek food however; some have more nefarious schemes in mind, one such being the weird slime known as the BRAIN DEFILER. It looks like a shining, glutinous, quivering mass of protoplasm, with two dark lumps embedded in the transparent gel that seem to stare like primitive eyes. If its victim is unaware of it, the thing will land on him on a roll of 1-5 on one die. Otherwise, a normal Attack Round should be rolled.

If the Brain Defiler wins the Attack Round, it inflicts Small Bite damage and attempts to take control of the victim's mind. If injured, it drops to the floor, then scampers to the ceiling to recuperate.

Brain Defilers are often found on humanoids like Orcs, Goblins, or Ogres, disguised as headgear such as turbans or battle helms. When a host is defeated, the Brain Defiler is revealed, and it uses its psychic power to convince a new victim to wear it, requiring a Test for Luck. If removed by colleagues, the victim loses 1 SKILL point. The headgear/parasite must be destroyed, as even glancing at it requires a Test for Luck.

If a Brain Defiler successfully attaches to a victim, they experience initial panic, followed by a sensation of cold jelly, then submergence in alien images, loss of personality, and replacement with inhuman desires and needs. The victim becomes a slave to the creature.
