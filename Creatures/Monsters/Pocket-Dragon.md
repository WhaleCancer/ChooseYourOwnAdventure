## Description

The POCKET DRAGON is a rare, strange pint-sized

species of Dragon infrequently found lurking in

desolate spots across Titan, from tangled lonely

woods to grey, misty crags. In appearance they are

dragon-like but very small, ranging in size from

twenty centimetres to up to a meter from the tip of

their snout to the end of their forked tail. Pocket

Dragons vary

in colour

(often mimicking

the

colours of local, larger Dragons), and have a row of

spines down their back, as well as a pair of very

fine, rainbow-coloured wings. If a;acked a Pocket

Dragon will defend itself with its tooth-lined jaws,

and every three A;ack Rounds it will also breath a

jet of flame at whoever it facing; the victim must

roll equal to or under their SKILL score on two dice

or lose 1 point of STAMINA from being burnt.
