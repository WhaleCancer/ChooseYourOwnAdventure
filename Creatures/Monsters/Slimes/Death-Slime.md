## Description

Goblins to Skorn and Dwarfs to Troglodytes, is the

lethal DEATH SLIME. This appears as thick, slimy

green-hued jelly, running down the walls of a

dungeon corridor, with large globules of the stuff

also falling from the ceiling. In the presence of prey

it can reform itself into a big ball of slime, or even

everything it comes into touch with, except rock
