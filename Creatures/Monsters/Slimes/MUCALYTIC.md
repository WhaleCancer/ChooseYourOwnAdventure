## Description

Well known in folk-tales. for their disgusting habits,
MUCALYTICS are vile, slime-loving things. Vaguely
humanoid in shape, but about the size of a bear, they are
lumpy, ugly beasts. Most of their features are hidden under
the filth and muck they plaster over themselves, but the
trunk-like snouts that poke from the front of their faces will
be visible, snorting the air or rooting in the slime. They are

revolting beasts, and anyone encountering them in their
cesspool of a lair will immediately lose 2 points of STAMINA
as a result of the stench.
In a fight, a Mucalytic will flail about with its huge arms, but
when it has softened up its opponent, it will resort to other
tactics. After landing three successful blows, the Mucalytic
will grab hold of its opponent, draw him near to its mouth
and breathe on him. A Mucalytic can exhale highly poisonous
fumes at will, of which even a short sniff is enough to kill!
No one is sure where the disgusting beasts came from, but it
is well known that the Archmage in Mampang hired some to
guard his dungeons. It is said that they still lurk beneath the
citadel, wallowing in their slime and filth.
