## Description

Its name says exactly what the SLIME EATER does: the
disgusting thing delights in feeding on the foul gunge that
collects in cesspools and sewers, especially under old cities
like Khare. They are huge, blubbery creatures, roughly hu-
manoid in size, with a vast trough of a mouth, which is
perfect for scooping up sludge. Their large eyes are ringed
red from the overwhelming fumes of their homes, and they
have a pair of short, tube-like horns which blow sulphurous
steam from the tops of their heads. Their whole body is
bloated and flabby, their arms and legs fat but also muscular.
Slime Eaters are very sociable creatures, and can often be
found wallowing together in the muck that fills their tunnels.
When one of them, foraging for food, discovers a particularly
choice slurry of stinking sewage, it will bellow down the
echoing tunnels for its fellows to join it for a feast. As well as
slime, the creatures also enjoy fresh meat, though most of the
time they have to settle for rats or Sewer Snakes, which are
apparently very stringy. There is a rumour that speaks of a
giant Slime Eater, served by a horde of lesser beasts, which
dwells in a cavernous sewer deep below Khare – though no
one has dared test the truth of it!
