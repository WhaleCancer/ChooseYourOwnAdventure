## Description

In the stinking, black, slime-filled waters at the heart of a
swamp, there live disgusting and dangerous beasts known
as SLIME SUCKERS. They look like creatures out of a night-
mare. Six octopus-like legs support a shapeless body, which
merges into a head with huge, evil eyes and a cavernous,
tooth-filled mouth. From the top of its head sprouts a pair of
breathing-tubes that allow it to lurk beneath the surface of
the mud, awaiting its next meal. Dark green, foul-smelling
slime covers its body, and it gurgles disgustingly in anticipa-
tion of a meal.
Fighting such a creature often means standing knee-deep in
mud, which will temporarily reduce the opponent's fighting
SKILL by 2 points. The Slime Sucker itself has little trouble
negotiating the treacherous swamps, shifting its weight from
one tentacle-like leg to another while lashing out at its prey
with two more. Once it has caught and killed its prey, it will
drag it beneath the stinking waters, to nibble it slowly to the
bone, gorging on the succulent meat.
