## Description

The CHAOS SLIME BEAST is a hideous creature found dwelling only in the darkest catacombs and the depths of fetid swamplands. One was even kept for a time in the second incarnation of the warlock Zagor's dungeon beneath Firetop Mountain, as a monster to be defeated for the gladiatorial trials called the Path of the Pits. They are bloated creatures, three metres tall and two metres wide, and resemble a Giant Toad in general appearance.

Chaos Slime Beasts have green horned skin on their backs and a soft, yellowish underbelly, covered with red spots. The head is large and its main feature is a wide mouth with rows of long spiked teeth, while two bulbous red eyes protrude above slimy nostrils. It has powerful arms and sharp-clawed hands the size of dragons' feet, which it uses to subdue its prey.

**Acid Drool:** When the Chaos Slime Beast enters a fighting frenzy, it drools acid and spits it at foes. Roll one die: on a roll of 1-3, the acid hits and inflicts 1 extra STAMINA point of damage; on a roll of 4-6, it misses.
