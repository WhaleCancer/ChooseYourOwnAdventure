## Description

Not even the wisest desert nomads can tell where a GRETCH
is hidden deep under the sands, waiting to surprise its un-
wary prey. The creatures are highly skilled at covering their
tracks, and then burying themselves under the sand without
a trace, leaving only two minute holes for their keen eyes to
watch for the approach of a suitable meal. Gretch are thin,
sandy-coloured reptilian monsters, which usually walk on
their hind legs, standing as tall as a man. They have large
heads, like that of a snake or lizard, with forked tongues and
wide fang-filled mouths. Each scaly hand ends in one long
claw, like a cruel curved dagger, honed and sharpened until
it can slice through skin and bone alike.
Gretch are cold-blooded creatures, and can survive well in
the baking heat of the desert, though even they must shelter
from its might as midday approaches, under the cooling
sands. They are carnivorous, and will hide near water-holes
and popular caravan routes, to prey on 'travellers and their
mounts. They bury themselves and wait. When a suitable
meal approaches, they will burst out of the sand and pounce
on their surprised prey. Their claws are so sharp that they
will do 3 points of damage in a successful hit. Their constant
need for food makes them fight to the death, for an injured
Gretch will die a slow, painful death from starvation, unable
to capture its much-needed food.
