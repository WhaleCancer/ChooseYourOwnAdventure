## Description

In dark places underground there lurk strangely malleable
creatures called IMITATORS. In their natural form they are
shapeless, flowing things, like a pool of thick mud. When
hunting their favourite food – warm meat – they can adapt
themselves to look like something else. To trap an unintelli-
gent creature they may mimic its potential food; for a more
intelligent human or Orc, they will pose as a door or trea-
sure-chest.
When the gullible victim touches the Imitator, he will stick
fast, held by a glue-like substance secreted by the creature.
At the same time it will strike with a large fist-shaped protru-
sion. The trapped prey can fight back, but with a SKILL
reduced by 2. Once the 'fist' has been cut off, the victim can
finish off the Imitator at leisure, before slowly prising him-
self off the glue.
