## Description

There are a number of beasts that recur again and again in
the bestiaries of sages and the cautionary tales of nursemaids;
their powers become more and more exaggerated through
the years. Some creatures, however, turn out to be just as
black as they have been painted: one such is the
BLOODBEAST.
This monstrosity is large, at least four metres long, and so
bloated it can never leave the pool of foul slime that has
supported its bulk since it was spawned. Its hide is tough and
leathery, protected by thin spines and coloured a disgusting
grey-green. Its head appears to consist of a myriad eyes above
a vacant, toothy maw. The Bloodbeast's one major weakness
has always been its two real eyes, so it has evolved hundreds
of fake 'eyes' that rise in blisters before bursting open on its
head. Anyone taking on the creature will need a lucky strike
(Test for Luck) to hit its real eyes and pierce its brain.
Attempting such a blow, however, means avoiding the thing's
long, slimy, pink tongue. Unless its opponent can slash off
the tongue with a dagger (by rolling his SKIL L or less on two
dice), he will be dragged into the pool, where the powerfully
acidic slime will quickly decompose his body, until it is ready
to be eaten!
