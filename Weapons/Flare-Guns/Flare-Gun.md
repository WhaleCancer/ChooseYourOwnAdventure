# Flare Gun

**Manufacturer:** Various  
**Caliber:** 12-gauge flares, 25mm flares, 26.5mm flares  
**Type:** Signal device / improvised weapon

Devices designed to launch signal flares for distress signaling or illumination. In 1985 British Columbia, flare guns would be encountered with boaters, aircraft, hikers, or anyone who might need to signal for help. Available in various calibers, with 12-gauge being common for marine use. Encountered with boaters, aircraft operators, outdoor enthusiasts, or in emergency situations. Flare guns are primarily signaling devices but can potentially be used as improvised weapons, though they are not designed for that purpose. The presence of flare guns indicates legitimate signaling needs or, rarely, improvised weapon use. Common in marine and aviation contexts where distress signaling is essential.
