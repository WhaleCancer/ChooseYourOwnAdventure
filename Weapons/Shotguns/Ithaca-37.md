# Ithaca 37

**Manufacturer:** Ithaca Gun Company  
**Gauge:** 12-gauge (most common), also 16 and 20-gauge  
**Type:** Pump-action shotgun

A pump-action shotgun known for its bottom-ejection system, making it ambidextrous and suitable for both left and right-handed shooters. Used by some police departments and military units, as well as civilians. The bottom-eject design also keeps spent shells from flying into the shooter's face, making it popular for certain tactical applications. Less common than the Remington 870 but still encountered with law enforcement and civilian shooters.
