# Tear Gas

**Manufacturer:** Various  
**Type:** Chemical irritant (CS gas, CN gas)

Chemical irritants used for crowd control and riot situations. In 1985 British Columbia, tear gas would be encountered primarily with police forces, especially during protests, riots, or crowd control situations. Available in canister form for launchers or in grenade form. The presence of tear gas indicates police crowd control operations or, rarely, in criminal hands if stolen from police. Tear gas is a less-lethal option used to disperse crowds or incapacitate individuals without causing permanent harm, though it can be dangerous in enclosed spaces.
