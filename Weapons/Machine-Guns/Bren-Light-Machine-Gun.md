# Bren Light Machine Gun

**Manufacturer:** Various (British/Canadian wartime production)  
**Caliber:** .303 British (original), 7.62×51mm NATO (later conversions)  
**Type:** Light machine gun (magazine-fed)

A British light machine gun introduced in the 1930s that remained in service with Commonwealth forces, including Canada, into the late 20th century. Known for its reliability and accuracy, the Bren features a top-mounted magazine and quick-change barrel. Originally chambered in .303 British, many were later converted to 7.62×51mm NATO. In 1985 British Columbia, the Bren would be extremely rare, encountered primarily in reserve units, military museums, or as surplus equipment. Most Bren guns had been replaced by the C2A1 and then the C9, but some may have remained in storage or with reserve forces. The Bren's presence would indicate older military equipment or historical significance.
