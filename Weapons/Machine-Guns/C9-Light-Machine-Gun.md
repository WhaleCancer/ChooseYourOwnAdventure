# C9 Light Machine Gun

**Manufacturer:** Fabrique Nationale (FN)  
**Caliber:** 5.56×45mm NATO  
**Type:** Light machine gun (belt-fed)

The Canadian designation for the FN Minimi, a light machine gun designed to provide automatic fire support for infantry sections. Chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, the same cartridge as the C7 assault rifle, allowing for ammunition compatibility. Can be fed from belts or M16-style magazines. Introduced to replace the C2A1, the C9 was being adopted by Canadian forces in the mid-1980s. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered with forward-deployed Canadian military units that had received the new equipment. The C9's lighter weight and smaller cartridge compared to the C6 make it more mobile, suitable for infantry sections. Less common than the C6 in 1985 as the adoption was ongoing, but represents the future of Canadian light machine gun support.
