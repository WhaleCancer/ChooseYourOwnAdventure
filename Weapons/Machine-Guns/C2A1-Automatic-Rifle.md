**Manufacturer:** Canadian Arsenals Limited  
**Caliber:** 7.62×51mm NATO  
**Type:** Automatic rifle / light machine gun

A fully automatic variant of the C1A1 designed to serve as a section support weapon, functioning as a light machine gun. Features a heavy barrel, foldable bipod integrated into the handguard, and uses 30-round magazines. The C2A1 was produced to replace the Bren Gun for the Canadian Army, though it was being phased out in favor of the C9 by 1985. In 1985 British Columbia, still encountered with Canadian military units that hadn't yet received the C9, or in reserve/older equipment contexts. The C2A1's automatic fire capability and heavier construction make it a true machine gun, providing sustained fire support for infantry sections. Less common than the C6 but still in service during the transition period.
