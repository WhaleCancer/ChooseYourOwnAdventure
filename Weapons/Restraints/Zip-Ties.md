# Zip Ties / Cable Ties

Plastic cable ties used as improvised restraints. In 1985 British Columbia, zip ties would be commonly available as general-purpose fasteners, but could be used as restraints by police, criminals, or anyone needing to secure someone. Encountered with police as backup restraints, criminals for kidnapping or securing victims, or in various contexts where temporary restraint is needed. Zip ties are lightweight, disposable, and effective for short-term restraint. Their presence indicates either legitimate use as fasteners or, when used as restraints, indicates police operations or criminal activity. More common in the 1980s as they became widely available.
