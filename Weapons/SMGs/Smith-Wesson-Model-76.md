# Smith & Wesson Model 76

**Manufacturer:** Smith & Wesson  
**Caliber:** 9×19mm Parabellum  
**Type:** Submachine gun

Developed in the late 1960s, the Model 76 was intended for military use but also saw adoption by certain law enforcement agencies. Its design was influenced by the Swedish Carl Gustaf m/45, featuring a simple blowback operation and reliability. Chambered in 9mm with 24 or 36-round magazines. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered primarily with specialized police units or, rarely, in military contexts. Less common than the MP5 or C1, but used by some law enforcement agencies that preferred its design. The Model 76's presence indicates specialized law enforcement operations, though it was being superseded by more modern designs by 1985.
