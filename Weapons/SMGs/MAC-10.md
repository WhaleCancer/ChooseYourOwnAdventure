# MAC-10

**Manufacturer:** Military Armament Corporation / Various  
**Caliber:** .45 ACP or 9×19mm Parabellum  
**Type:** Submachine gun

A compact, blowback-operated submachine gun that gained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s. Extremely compact design with a high rate of fire (approximately 1,100 rounds per minute). Chambered in .45 ACP or 9mm with 30 or 32-round magazines. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered primarily in criminal hands through illegal acquisition or smuggling. The MAC-10's small size and high rate of fire made it appealing to criminal elements, though its presence indicates serious organized crime or high-level criminal activity. Rarely encountered with law enforcement, as most police forces preferred more controllable SMGs. The MAC-10's presence suggests dangerous criminal operations.
