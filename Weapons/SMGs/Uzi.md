# Uzi

**Manufacturer:** Israel Military Industries  
**Caliber:** 9×19mm Parabellum  
**Type:** Submachine gun

An Israeli-designed submachine gun that became popular worldwide with military and police forces. Features a compact design with an overhanging bolt and telescoping bolt design. Chambered in 9mm with 20, 32, or 40-round magazines. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered primarily with specialized police units or, rarely, in criminal hands through illegal acquisition. The Uzi's compact size and high rate of fire made it attractive to both law enforcement and criminal elements. More likely to be encountered with police tactical units than with criminals, but its presence in either context indicates serious firepower. The Uzi's distinctive appearance makes it easily recognizable.
