An even more compact version of the MAC-10, chambered in .380 ACP or 9mm. Features an extremely high rate of fire (approximately 1,200 rounds per minute) and very compact dimensions. The MAC-11 is essentially a scaled-down MAC-10, making it even more concealable. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered primarily in criminal hands, often associated with organized crime or serious criminal enterprises. The MAC-11's extreme compactness and high rate of fire make it particularly dangerous, though its small size also makes it less controllable.
