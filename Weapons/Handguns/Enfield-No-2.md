# Enfield No. 2

**Manufacturer:** Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield  
**Caliber:** .38 S&W (.38/200)  
**Type:** Revolver (Top-break)

A British military revolver that was standard issue during World War II. Like the Webley, these are primarily found as surplus weapons or in collections by 1985. The .38 S&W cartridge is less powerful than modern .38 Special, but the revolver is still functional. Most commonly encountered as a collector's item or family heirloom, though some may still be in use by older individuals or in remote areas.
