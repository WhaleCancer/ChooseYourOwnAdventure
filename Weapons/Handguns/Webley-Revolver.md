# Webley Revolver

**Manufacturer:** Webley & Scott  
**Caliber:** .455 Webley  
**Type:** Revolver (Top-break)

A British military revolver that saw service from 1887 to 1963. While officially obsolete by 1985, these revolvers can still be found in surplus stores, private collections, or in the hands of veterans and collectors. The top-break action and distinctive .455 Webley cartridge make it easily recognizable. Less common but occasionally encountered in rural areas or with older individuals who served in Commonwealth forces.
