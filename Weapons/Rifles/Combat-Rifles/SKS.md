# SKS

**Manufacturer:** Soviet State Arsenals / Various  
**Caliber:** 7.62×39mm  
**Type:** Semi-automatic rifle

A Soviet-designed semi-automatic rifle that became widely available as military surplus in Canada. Chambered in 7.62×39mm with a 10-round internal magazine (though detachable magazines were sometimes used). The SKS was inexpensive, reliable, and chambered in a powerful cartridge, making it popular among civilian shooters and unfortunately also attractive to criminals. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered with civilian firearms owners, hunters who prefer semi-automatic rifles, or in criminal contexts where surplus military weapons were acquired illegally. The SKS's military appearance and semi-automatic capability made it a common choice for those seeking a military-style rifle without the restrictions of true assault weapons.
