Available in various calibers suitable for big game hunting. In 1985 British Columbia, encountered with serious hunters who value the semi-automatic capability for hunting in dense forests or when pursuing dangerous game.

The semi-automatic action makes it more versatile than traditional hunting rifles, though it remains a civilian hunting weapon, not a military firearm.
