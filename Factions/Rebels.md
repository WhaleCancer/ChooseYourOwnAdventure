# Rebels and Resistance

**Type:** Resistance movement / Anti-Archon groups  
**Era:** Ongoing  
**Status:** Fragmented, underground, constantly under threat

## Overview

In the context of the EPIC setting and the Archon prison dimension cosmology, **rebels** refers to individuals or groups who, in some way, threaten the maintenance of the Veil and the passivity of humanity. These are people who question, resist, or act against the order imposed by the Archons (the jailors), who strive for awakening, gnosis, or freedom—potentially jeopardizing the status quo of control and energetic harvest. Their "rebellion" might be conscious or unconscious, and is interpreted differently depending on worldview (spiritual, scientific, political, or cultural).

## Types of Rebels

### 1. Spiritual/Gnostic Rebels

- **Seekers of Gnosis:** Individuals who pursue hidden knowledge of the true nature of reality—esotericists, mystics, rogue clergy, and anyone seeking spiritual awakening
- **Ritual Breakers:** Shamans, witches, or cult leaders who practice ceremonies specifically to open the veil, expel possessing entities, or weaken the "frequency fence"

**Mythic Archetype:** These are the "Prometheans," the serpent in Eden, or Luciferian fallen angels—those who refuse ignorant obedience and seek the forbidden truth.

### 2. Scientific/Technological Rebels

- **Mad Scientists:** Parapsychologists, rogue ORION coders, military engineers, or physicists who stumble on (or deliberately pursue) technologies that can pierce the veil: resonance chambers, brainwave amplifiers, particle accelerators used for occult purposes
- **Whistleblowers:** Technicians or analysts who, discovering the conspiracy's true scale, act to leak knowledge, subvert experiments, or expose the Archon agenda

**Modern Example:** Think of someone like Tesla, John Dee, or in-campaign, a dissident ORION tech sabotaging "veil integrity" protocols.

### 3. Political & Social Rebels

- **Activist Movements:** Groups that, intentionally or not, disrupt mass rituals, break up harmful cults, or organize the public in ways that generate collective willpower and free thought
- **First Nations Elders and Community Organizers:** Using traditional knowledge and ceremonial power, these figures may ritually defend sacred land, hold back psychic invasions, and keep cultural memory alive—directly opposing the dulling effects of the Veil

**Example:** The [Watchtower Cleavers](./Factions/Cults/Watchtower-Cleavers.md) (even if deluded in doctrine), wildcat union organizers who resist mind-numbing "treatments," or local councils who revive ancient resistance rites. The [NDP](./Factions/Government/NDP.md) also represents a political resistance movement, though largely broken and underground by 1985.

### 4. Unwitting Rebels

- **Psychic Outliers:** Traumatically awakened children, accidental visionaries, or people afflicted by "glitches" in veil maintenance—those who see, dream, or influence reality in ways outside Archon control
- **Reluctant Characters:** PCs themselves often fall in this category: stumbling into the prison's architecture by chance and forced to choose a side

**Classic Trope:** Haunted artists, mentally ill prophets, or children who become the focus of "awakening" events (sometimes at great personal risk).

## What Happens to Rebels?

- **Suppression:** They are targeted by Greys for abductions, memory-wipes, or even engineered accidents and disappearances
- **Possession or Reprogramming:** The Archons may directly possess or overwrite especially dangerous rebels, sending them back as "wolves in shepherds' clothing" or simply breaking their minds
- **Elevation/Scapegoating:** Occasionally, rebels are "turned" and set up as cult leaders, martyrs, or scapegoats to control or distract the populace

## Resistance Networks

### Underground Cells

- Secret meetings in church basements, union halls, or on forests and reserves that retain spiritual "thickness" against Archon influence
- Networks connecting First Nations leaders, rogue scientists, spiritual outcasts, and select unionists
- Part political, part spiritual, and part conspiracy cell

### Information Networks

- Underground press, samizdat zines, pirate radio, and word-of-mouth dissemination
- Stories of "odd government projects," water contamination, and unexplained disappearances
- Tiptoeing around direct mentions of the Greys or Archons to avoid immediate destruction

### Countermeasures

- Rituals or counter-signals to ward off the psychic malaise: sacred fires, encrypted chants, anti-broadcasts through modified radios
- Occult symbolism—usually spiral-breaking glyphs or counter-triangle motifs—quietly seeded in protest art, zines, or even schoolyard graffiti
- Signal jamming, truth frequencies, and "reset prayers" distributed by resistance networks

## In-World Example Rumors and Hooks

- "Did you hear about the old shaman up north who can speak three languages he never learned? They say he broke a Grey's face in half just with a song."
- "Every time an ORION technician goes missing, we find another 'safety protocol' added that leaves us more blind. They don't want anyone thinking too much."
- "My cousin saw one of those Cleaver people walking right through a blackout—the shadows parted. Maybe they aren't crazy after all."

## In Play

Rebels serve as:

- **Allies** - Potential contacts and allies for PCs fighting against Archon control
- **Information sources** - People who know about the true nature of reality
- **Tragic examples** - What happens when resistance becomes too visible
- **Underground networks** - Safe houses, information, and support
- **Campaign hooks** - PCs may be recruited or stumble into resistance activities

### Game Considerations

- Rebels are fragmented and often don't trust each other
- Resistance activities are dangerous and attract Archon attention
- Different types of rebels may have conflicting methods or goals
- Some rebels may be compromised or turned
- PCs may need to navigate between different rebel factions

## Summary

**Rebels** are, above all, those who threaten to disrupt the Veil, free others, or awaken themselves—spiritually, scientifically, or socially. The Archons target them for subversion, punishment, or, rarely, to neutralize by absorbing their influence. Despite the constant threat, resistance continues in small, scattered cells, keeping the flame of truth alive in the darkness of the prison dimension.
