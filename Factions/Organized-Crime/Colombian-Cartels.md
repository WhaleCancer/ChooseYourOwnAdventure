# Colombian Cartels

**Type:** International drug trafficking organizations  
**Territory:** Distribution networks throughout British Columbia, with primary operations in Vancouver and major transportation corridors  
**Era:** Peak power in the 1980s, with BC as a key North American distribution hub

Colombian drug cartels operating distribution networks in British Columbia. In 1985, these organizations are at the height of their power, having established sophisticated international operations that funnel cocaine and other narcotics from South America through British Columbia to markets across North America. Vancouver's port, proximity to the United States border, and relatively porous security make it an ideal distribution hub. These cartels represent some of the most dangerous and well-funded criminal organizations in the world.

**Structure and Operations:**
- Highly organized, paramilitary-style operations with clear command structures
- Primary revenue stream: cocaine trafficking, with secondary operations in heroin and marijuana
- Sophisticated transportation networks: shipping containers, private aircraft, human couriers
- Distribution partnerships with local criminal organizations (biker gangs, street gangs, triads)
- Extensive money laundering operations through legitimate businesses and offshore accounts
- Known for extreme violence, including assassinations, bombings, and intimidation of law enforcement
- Operations often compartmentalized, with local representatives managing distribution while maintaining distance from cartel leadership

**Typical Members:**
- Mix of Colombian nationals and local operatives recruited in British Columbia
- Highly disciplined, well-trained, and motivated by significant financial rewards
- Some members have military or paramilitary backgrounds
- Local representatives often blend into immigrant communities or legitimate business circles
- Strong emphasis on loyalty, with severe consequences for betrayal
- Operate with a level of sophistication and resources that rivals government agencies

**Equipment and Resources:**
- High-quality weapons, often military-grade (assault rifles, explosives, body armor)
- Private aircraft and boats for transportation
- Sophisticated communication equipment
- Extensive financial resources for bribes, safe houses, and operations
- Connections to suppliers, distributors, and markets across North and South America
- Safe houses and operational bases in both urban and remote locations
- Access to forged documents, false identities, and escape routes

**In the Shadows:**
The Colombian cartels operate with a level of organization and resources that makes them nearly a parallel government in some regions. In British Columbia, their operations are more subtle but no less dangerous. They maintain relationships with corrupt officials, legitimate businesses, and other criminal organizations. The sheer volume of money and product flowing through their networks means they encounter all manner of people and situations. Some cartel operations have stumbled upon things they weren't looking for—strange cargo, unexplained phenomena in remote areas used for transportation, and encounters with entities that don't fit into their worldview of drugs, money, and power. A few high-level operatives have developed an interest in certain artifacts or phenomena, seeing potential value or threat in things that defy explanation.

**Game Considerations:**
- Extremely dangerous antagonists with significant resources and no qualms about violence
- Potential source of high-quality weapons, vehicles, and illegal services
- Information networks spanning multiple countries and criminal organizations
- Can serve as powerful enemies or dangerous allies with proper approach
- May have encountered strange phenomena during remote transportation operations
- Connections to corrupt officials and legitimate businesses create investigation opportunities
- Extreme wealth makes them potential patrons for dangerous missions
- Compartmentalized structure creates opportunities for infiltration or manipulation
- Known for eliminating witnesses and threats, making them particularly dangerous
- May have interest in or knowledge of artifacts, phenomena, or locations that intersect with their operations
