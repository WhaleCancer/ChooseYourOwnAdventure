## Big Circle Boys (Triads)

**Type:** Chinese organized‑crime network (loosely “Triads”)  
**Territory:** Vancouver / Lower Mainland (Chinatown, Richmond, Delta), with ties to Hong Kong and Guangzhou  
**Era:** 1985 – Quiet consolidation behind more visible outlaw groups

To most cops and journalists, the **Hells Angels** are the face of organized crime in B.C. in 1985. Behind them, in the shadows of the port and the Chinatown alleyways, sit the **Big Circle Boys**—a loose network of Chinese crews linked to ex‑Red Guards, Hong Kong syndicates, and ambitious local operators.

They do not look like the ritual‑heavy “Triads” of old Hong Kong movies:

- No banners or public ceremonies.  
- Little obvious ink.  
- No single Dragon Head.  

Instead, they function as a **back‑end infrastructure for crime**:

- Ports, containers, and shipping paperwork.  
- High‑risk jobs that need brains as much as muscle.  
- Money movement and quiet violence.

In an EPIC/X‑Files campaign, the Big Circle Boys are **grounded criminals** who keep accidentally brushing up against the paranormal: strange cargo, cursed shipments, unexplained illnesses, or “medicine” that does things no drug should do.

### Reputation & Public Perception

**Among cops (1985):**

- **Rank‑and‑file:**  
  - “Some Chinese gangs in Chinatown, mostly shooting each other over gambling and drugs.”  
- **A few detectives / analysts:**  
  - “If you follow the containers and the money, you keep bumping into the same ghost: Big Circle Boys.”

**On the street:**

- **Non‑Chinese criminals:**  
  - “You want heroin or high‑end jobs done quiet? You talk to the Big Circle guys—if they let you.”  
- **In Chinese communities:**  
  - Whispers about **Da Yuan Jai** (“Big Circle Boys”) mixing fear, resentment, and grudging respect.  
  - Some neighborhoods get “protected,” but the price—in money, silence, and favours—is high.

### Structure (Loose Network, Not a Pyramid)

The Big Circle Boys are not a rigid Triad society. They are a **network of cells** held together by shared identity, contacts, and services.

**Cells (Crews):**

- 5–15 members.  
- Specialisations vary by crew:  
  - Robbery and high‑risk theft.  
  - Extortion and protection.  
  - Smuggling and port work.  
  - Enforcement and “problem solving.”  
- Each cell has its own “boss,” but there is **no single Dragon Head** everyone reports to.

**Coordinators (“Uncles” / “Big Brothers”):**

- 4–6 older, well‑connected figures in Vancouver & Richmond.  
- Not formal bosses; more like **brokers and fixers**:  
  - Arrange access to corrupt dockworkers or customs officials.  
  - Set up major drug shipments.  
  - Mediate disputes between cells and with outside factions.
- Cells that cross them find their world shrinking:  
  - Access to drugs dries up.  
  - Safehouses disappear.  
  - People vanish.

**Shared Services:**

- Forgers, money launderers, “community” lawyers, and immigration consultants.  
- Shared safehouses, warehouses, and brokers at the port.  
- Contacts with suppliers in Hong Kong / Guangzhou and beyond.

These shared resources make the BCB feel like a **unified faction**, even though the internal structure is more web than ladder.

### Main Operations (1985)

#### 1. Drug Import & Wholesale

- **Heroin** from the Golden Triangle via Hong Kong is the primary product.  
- The BCB specialise in **import and wholesale**, not street‑level dealing:  
  - They sell in bulk to Chinatown dealers, biker gangs, white‑boy crews, and smaller immigrant outfits.  
- They are experimenting with **cocaine and synthetics**, using Southeast Asian and Latin American links.

**Game angle:**  
The BCB are the ones behind odd cargoes—mislabeled containers, “tea sets” that glow under UV, or heroin cut with something that has inexplicable side effects.

#### 2. Logistics & Port Corruption

- Quiet influence over:  
  - Selected dockworkers and crane operators.  
  - A handful of customs / shipping agents and port security staff.  
- Use legitimate front companies:  
  - Import–export firms.  
  - Seafood wholesalers.  
  - Freight forwarders and customs brokers.

They swap container numbers, mislabel cargo, and massage manifests, turning the port into a **trusted smuggling artery**.

**Game angle:**  
A customs officer dies “accidentally” after flagging a container with strange radiation. The BCB were moving it, but even they did not know what was inside.

#### 3. Gambling & Loansharking

- Illegal casinos and mah‑jong rooms in:  
  - Vancouver Chinatown.  
  - Parts of Richmond and Burnaby.  
- High‑interest loans to:  
  - Business owners.  
  - Gamblers.  
  - New immigrants with no bank access.
- Enforcement is **targeted and quiet**:  
  - Beatings, kidnappings, threats to family, reputational ruin.

**Game angle:**  
A gambler goes missing after claiming he saw “something wrong” in a back‑room casino—something non‑human at a high‑rollers’ table, or a game that rewound when he should have died.

#### 4. High‑Risk Jobs

- Armed robberies, armoured‑truck hits, kidnappings of high‑value targets.  
- Contracts other gangs decline:  
  - Storming secure facilities.  
  - Extracting people or items out of police custody.  
- Not every cell is this capable, but the legend is:  
  - “If it’s insane but possible, Big Circle can do it.”

**Game angle:**  
They’re hired—by humans or otherwise—to hijack a mysterious convoy your agents are also shadowing.

#### 5. Fraud & Money Laundering

- Stolen and counterfeit credit cards.  
- Loan and cheque fraud, small‑business scams.  
- Property purchases via shell companies and relatives.  
- Funds cycled through Hong Kong and back into B.C.

**Game angle:**  
Paper trails from paranormal black‑budget programs overlap with BCB laundromats and shipping firms, suggesting someone inside the state is quietly piggybacking on their network.

### Relationship with the Hells Angels

**Status:** Parity and mutual dependency.

**BCB strengths:**

- Overseas product and shipping access.  
- Port and logistics manipulation.  
- Quiet, targeted violence.

**Hells Angels strengths:**

- Dominance in rural and suburban drug markets.  
- Control over biker bars, strip clubs, and visible rackets.  
- A strong “brand” and intimidation factor on the street.

**Working relationship:**

- Big Circle Boys often sell heroin and cocaine **wholesale** to the Angels, who handle:  
  - Street‑level distribution.  
  - Rural and small‑town expansion.

**Unwritten pact:**

- BCB do not try to take over biker bars or small‑town rackets.  
- Angels do not push hard into Chinatown gambling or port corruption.

**Tensions:**

- Flare when:  
  - Bikers stiff the BCB on payment.  
  - BCB undercut Angels by selling directly to certain dealers.
- Usually handled through intermediaries before turning into open war.

**Game angle:**  
Agents stumble into a three‑way standoff: **Big Circle Boys vs. Hells Angels vs. Agency/Conspiracy**, all fighting over a single crate no one fully understands.

### Relationship with the Paranormal / X‑Files Elements

Officially, the Big Circle Boys are **mundane criminals**. Unofficially, they are perfect bridges between normal crime and the weird.

**Unwitting couriers:**

- Move sealed canisters, “medical shipments,” rare animal parts for unknown foreign clients.  
- After‑effects:  
  - Dockworkers get sick, have visions, or vanish.  
  - Animals at the port panic or behave strangely during specific arrivals.

**Folk practices and quiet superstition:**

- Some older members respect **Taoist rituals, ancestor offerings, and protective charms**.  
- Rumours:  
  - Certain coordinators insist on ritual protection before key deals.  
  - A cell believes a particular warehouse is “lucky” because bullets misfire there.

**Experimentation gone wrong:**

- A cell obtains:  
  - A “chemical enhancer” (actually an experimental serum).  
  - A strange powder they think is just a new drug.  
- Side‑effects:  
  - Superhuman calm or strength.  
  - Unexplainable changes in bloodwork or DNA.  
  - Night terrors and shared visions.

**Quiet knowledge:**

- They have seen enough to know there are **other forces** in the world.  
- Certain routes, items, and clients are “bad luck,” and they will refuse some jobs without explaining why.  
- They may reluctantly seek help from PCs when something gets too weird even for them.

### How Investigators Encounter Them

Entry points for player characters:

- **Missing‑person cases:**  
  - A gambler, dockworker, or student vanishes—owed money to the BCB and also brushed against something classified or alien.
- **Drug busts gone strange:**  
  - Heroin seizures with bizarre contaminants; witnesses reporting impossible side‑effects.  
- **Port anomalies:**  
  - Near‑accidents and malfunctions in a specific berth; containers whose paperwork “doesn’t exist,” all tied to BCB fronts.  
- **Financial irregularities:**  
  - Black‑project money laundered through BCB businesses—or vice versa, BCB funds quietly flowing into a shady government research shell.

### Faction Use at the Table

**Tone:**

- Grounded, pragmatic, quietly ruthless.  
- Not comic‑book villains—very human, with families, fears, and ambitions.

**Motivations:**

- Profit and security.  
- Protecting “their own” (family, dialect group, village ties).  
- Avoiding unnecessary attention from police, media, and foreign agencies.

**Tactics:**

- Bribery and favours first.  
- Blackmail and social pressure next.  
- Violence last—but efficient and final when needed.

**Levers PCs can pull:**

- Rivalries between cells.  
- Coordinators desperate to avoid weird heat or federal crackdowns.  
- Family members who are scared and might talk.

**Escalation pattern:**

- Start with quiet surveillance and intimidation.  
- Move to sabotage (bombed cars, ruined careers, leaked evidence).  
- End with disappearances, staged “suicides,” or professional hits.

The Big Circle Boys are a **flexible mid‑to‑high‑tier faction**: they can be uneasy allies, necessary evils, or long‑term antagonists whose interests occasionally align with the PCs—especially when stranger powers start using their network for purposes even they don’t understand.
