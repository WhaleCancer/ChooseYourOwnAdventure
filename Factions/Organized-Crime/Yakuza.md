# Yakuza

**Type:** Japanese organized crime syndicates  
**Territory:** Vancouver and coastal areas, with strong connections to Japan and Pacific Rim ports  
**Era:** Established presence with deep historical roots, maintaining operations in 1985

Traditional Japanese organized crime organizations operating in British Columbia. The Yakuza represent centuries-old criminal traditions adapted to modern international operations. In 1985, Vancouver's position as a Pacific gateway and its Japanese-Canadian community provide both cover and opportunity for these sophisticated criminal networks. While less visible than other organized crime groups, their influence extends through legitimate businesses, cultural institutions, and international trade.

**Structure and Operations:**
- Highly ritualistic organizations with strict codes of honor and hierarchy
- Multiple "families" or "clans" (notably the Yamaguchi-gumi and other major syndicates) operating through representatives
- Primary revenue streams: gambling operations, loan sharking, protection rackets, real estate manipulation, and import/export schemes
- Legitimate business fronts: restaurants, pachinko parlors, construction companies, shipping firms, and cultural associations
- Sophisticated financial operations and money laundering through international trade
- Strong connections to Japan, with Vancouver serving as a North American operations hub

**Typical Members:**
- Primarily ethnic Japanese, though some organizations include members of other backgrounds
- Strong emphasis on honor, loyalty, and traditional codes (yubitsume, or finger-cutting, as a form of atonement)
- Business-oriented with deep integration into legitimate commerce
- Disciplined, patient, and focused on long-term relationships and reputation
- Often well-educated and sophisticated, blending seamlessly into upper-class society
- Deep respect for tradition, ritual, and hierarchical structure

**Equipment and Resources:**
- Extensive legitimate business networks, especially in import/export and construction
- International shipping connections across the Pacific
- Sophisticated financial systems and banking relationships
- High-quality weapons (often imported or purchased through legitimate channels)
- Safe houses and meeting places in Japanese communities and business districts
- Connections to suppliers, markets, and criminal networks across Japan and the Pacific Rim
- Access to rare and exotic items through international trade networks

**In the Shadows:**
The Yakuza operate with a level of sophistication and cultural integration that makes them nearly invisible to mainstream society. Their operations are deeply embedded in legitimate business, and their traditional codes create a culture of silence that law enforcement finds nearly impossible to penetrate. In 1985, as Japan's economic power grows and Vancouver's role as a Pacific gateway expands, these organizations are positioning themselves for greater influence. Their connections to Japan's ancient traditions and esoteric knowledge make them particularly interesting—some clans maintain connections to Shinto practices, traditional martial arts schools, and collectors of historical artifacts. Rumors persist of certain families having knowledge of, or interest in, objects and phenomena that connect to Japanese mythology and folklore.

**Game Considerations:**
- Information networks spanning Japan and the Pacific Rim
- Potential source of rare artifacts, antiques, and exotic items through import connections
- Sophisticated financial services and money laundering capabilities
- May have knowledge of strange artifacts, ancient texts, or esoteric knowledge connected to Japanese mythology
- Can serve as mysterious patrons with access to resources and information
- Cultural barriers and language differences create roleplaying opportunities
- May be aware of or involved with phenomena that connect to Japanese folklore, Shinto beliefs, or historical mysteries
- Traditional codes of honor can create interesting moral dilemmas and relationship dynamics
- Less likely to use overt violence than other criminal groups, preferring psychological pressure and economic manipulation
