# Organized Crime Overview

**Type:** Criminal ecosystem and inter-organizational dynamics  
**Territory:** British Columbia, with connections extending internationally  
**Era:** 1985 - A period of expansion, conflict, and shifting alliances

The organized crime landscape in 1985 British Columbia is a complex web of competing, cooperating, and coexisting criminal organizations. No single group controls the province; instead, multiple syndicates operate in overlapping territories, forming temporary alliances, maintaining uneasy truces, and engaging in violent conflicts. Understanding how these organizations interact is crucial for navigating the criminal underworld.

## The Criminal Ecosystem

**Territorial Arrangements:**
Most criminal organizations maintain primary territories but operate with significant overlap. Urban centers like Vancouver see the most competition, with multiple groups operating simultaneously. Rural areas and transportation corridors are often controlled by biker gangs or smuggling networks, though other groups may pay for passage or services. Some territories are clearly defined through violence and reputation; others remain contested or shared through informal agreements.

**Business Relationships:**
Despite competition, criminal organizations frequently do business with each other. Biker gangs often serve as distributors for cartels and triads. Street gangs act as retail outlets for larger organizations. Smuggling networks provide transportation services to multiple groups. Yakuza and triads may cooperate on import/export operations. These business relationships create complex interdependencies that prevent all-out war but also create vulnerabilities when relationships break down.

**Hierarchy and Respect:**
A loose hierarchy exists based on power, resources, and reputation. Colombian cartels and established triads sit near the top due to their international reach and financial resources. Yakuza operate with significant influence but maintain lower profiles. Biker gangs—**dominated in B.C. by the Hells Angels and their prospect/puppet clubs**—control significant territory and have local power but lack the sophistication of international organizations. Street gangs operate at the bottom, often serving larger groups. Smuggling networks exist outside this hierarchy, providing services to all levels.

## Alliances and Conflicts

**Stable Alliances:**
- **Triads and Yakuza:** Occasional cooperation on Pacific Rim operations, though they maintain separate territories and rarely work directly together. Mutual respect for traditional codes and business practices.
- **Biker Gangs and Smuggling Networks:** Frequent partnerships on cross-border operations and rural transportation. Biker gangs provide muscle and local knowledge; smugglers provide expertise and routes.
- **Cartels and Local Distributors:** Colombian cartels maintain relationships with biker gangs and street gangs for distribution, creating a supplier-retailer dynamic.

**Ongoing Conflicts:**
- **Biker Gang Rivalries:** Multiple clubs compete for territory, leading to periodic violence. These conflicts can disrupt other criminal operations and draw law enforcement attention.
- **Street Gang Territorial Disputes:** Constant low-level conflict over neighborhoods, often escalating into violence that affects surrounding communities.
- **Distribution Disputes:** Competition over drug markets, especially in urban areas, creates friction between groups serving the same customers.

**Neutral Zones:**
Certain areas and operations remain neutral ground. Ports, major transportation hubs, and some legitimate businesses serve as meeting places where different organizations can interact without violence. These neutral zones are maintained through mutual interest and the threat of consequences for violations.

## Operational Overlap

**Drug Markets:**
The drug trade sees the most overlap and competition. Colombian cartels supply cocaine; triads and others import heroin and other narcotics. Biker gangs and street gangs compete for distribution rights and retail markets. This creates a complex supply chain with multiple points of potential conflict.

**Weapons Trafficking:**
Multiple groups engage in weapons trafficking, often sourcing from the same suppliers. Competition is less intense here, as demand is high and groups may trade weapons among themselves. Smuggling networks are particularly important for moving weapons across borders.

**Protection and Extortion:**
Territorial control often includes protection rackets and extortion. Overlapping territories can lead to businesses paying multiple groups, or conflicts when groups try to claim the same targets. This is a common source of friction.

**Legitimate Business Fronts:**
Many groups maintain legitimate businesses that may compete in the open market while their criminal operations remain separate. This creates an additional layer of interaction, with some groups forming business partnerships that have nothing to do with crime.

## The Law Enforcement Factor

Organized crime groups share a common enemy in law enforcement, which creates both opportunities and challenges. Groups may temporarily cooperate to avoid law enforcement pressure, share information about investigations, or coordinate responses to major operations. However, some groups actively feed information to law enforcement about rivals, using the police as a weapon against competitors.

## Strange Phenomena and the Criminal World

The criminal underworld is not immune to the strange phenomena plaguing British Columbia. Different organizations have encountered unexplained events in their operational areas, and their responses vary:

- **Biker Gangs:** Often encounter strange phenomena in remote areas. Some dismiss it as nonsense; others have developed their own folklore and superstitions. A few have learned to profit from or avoid certain locations.
- **Triads and Yakuza:** Traditional organizations with deep cultural roots may interpret phenomena through the lens of their own mythology and folklore. Some maintain interest in artifacts or knowledge that connects to their traditions.
- **Smuggling Networks:** Operators in remote areas are often the first to encounter unexplained phenomena. Some have developed specialties in moving "weird cargo" that doesn't fit normal categories.
- **Street Gangs:** Urban phenomena and abandoned locations create their own legends. Some gangs have developed superstitions or avoid certain areas based on unexplained events.

These encounters create new dynamics: groups may compete for strange artifacts, share information about dangerous locations, or form temporary alliances to investigate or exploit unexplained phenomena.

## Game Considerations

**Complex Relationships:**
Players navigating the criminal world will encounter complex relationships. An enemy of one group may be an ally of another. Actions against one organization may have unintended consequences with others. Understanding these relationships is crucial for survival.

**Opportunities for Manipulation:**
The complex web of alliances and conflicts creates opportunities. Players can play groups against each other, form temporary alliances, or exploit existing tensions. However, such manipulation is dangerous and can backfire spectacularly.

**Information Networks:**
Different groups have different information networks. Players may need to work with multiple organizations to gather complete information, each with their own price and risks.

**Escalation Risks:**
Actions against one group may trigger responses from others, especially if business relationships are disrupted. A conflict with a street gang may draw the attention of their suppliers. An attack on smuggling networks may affect multiple organizations that depend on their services.

**Neutral Ground:**
Understanding where neutral zones exist can be crucial for safe meetings, information exchange, and avoiding violence. Violating these unwritten rules can make enemies of multiple groups simultaneously.

**The Bigger Picture:**
In 1985, the criminal world is expanding and changing. New groups are emerging, old alliances are shifting, and the strange phenomena affecting British Columbia are creating new dynamics that no one fully understands. Players operating in this world must navigate not just individual organizations, but an entire ecosystem in flux.
