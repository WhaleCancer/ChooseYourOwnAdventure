# Smuggling Networks

**Type:** Cross-border smuggling operations and contraband trafficking  
**Territory:** British Columbia's borders (US border, ports, remote coastlines, and isolated crossing points)  
**Era:** Ongoing operations, with increased activity in the 1980s due to economic pressures and demand

Independent smuggling networks and operations specializing in moving contraband across British Columbia's borders and through its ports. Unlike organized crime syndicates, these are often loose confederations of independent operators, small crews, and specialized smugglers who work together on specific jobs. In 1985, the long, remote border with the United States, extensive coastline, and busy ports create numerous opportunities for those willing to take risks. These networks move everything from drugs and weapons to people, exotic animals, and items that don't appear on any customs forms.

**Structure and Operations:**
- Loose networks of independent operators, small crews, and specialized smugglers
- Often organized around specific routes, methods, or types of contraband
- Primary activities: drug smuggling, weapons trafficking, human smuggling, exotic goods, and specialized contraband
- Use of remote border crossings, small boats, private aircraft, and hidden compartments in legitimate cargo
- Relationships with legitimate businesses (trucking, shipping, aviation) for cover and logistics
- Flexible operations that adapt quickly to law enforcement pressure
- Some networks specialize in high-value, low-volume items; others focus on bulk operations

**Typical Members:**
- Mix of experienced smugglers, former military or law enforcement, pilots, boat captains, and truck drivers
- Often have legitimate jobs or businesses that provide cover
- Independent operators who value freedom and profit over organizational loyalty
- Skilled in navigation, logistics, and avoiding detection
- Some are part-time operators supplementing legitimate income; others are full-time professionals
- Strong emphasis on operational security and compartmentalization
- Often have knowledge of remote areas, weather patterns, and law enforcement procedures

**Equipment and Resources:**
- Specialized transportation: small aircraft, boats, modified vehicles, all-terrain vehicles
- Navigation and communication equipment
- Hidden compartments, false bottoms, and concealment methods
- Safe houses and staging areas near borders and ports
- Connections to suppliers and buyers on both sides of borders
- Knowledge of remote routes, weather patterns, and law enforcement schedules
- Access to legitimate transportation and shipping for cover operations
- Tools for creating false documentation and concealing contraband

**In the Shadows:**
Smuggling networks operate in the spaces between legitimate commerce and organized crime. Their success depends on knowledge of remote areas, understanding of systems, and the ability to move unseen. In British Columbia's vast wilderness and along its extensive coastline, smugglers often encounter things that aren't on any manifest—abandoned facilities, strange signals, unexplained phenomena in remote areas. Some smugglers have developed a sideline in moving items that don't fit normal categories: artifacts, biological samples, technology that doesn't match any known specifications. A few operators have become specialists in what they call "weird cargo," items that require special handling, unusual routes, and absolute discretion. These networks are often the first to notice when something strange appears in remote areas, and some have learned to profit from it.

**Game Considerations:**
- Information sources with knowledge of remote areas, borders, and transportation networks
- Potential source of transportation services, false documentation, and smuggling expertise
- May have encountered strange phenomena, abandoned facilities, or unexplained events in remote areas
- Can serve as guides, transporters, or information brokers for operations requiring border crossing or remote access
- Specialized knowledge of routes, weather, and law enforcement creates valuable intelligence
- Independent operators can be more flexible allies than organized crime groups
- May have knowledge of or involvement with "weird cargo" and unexplained phenomena
- Useful for scenarios involving remote locations, border crossings, or specialized transportation needs
- Some operators may have developed superstitions or knowledge about strange occurrences in their operational areas
- Can provide access to locations and information that other criminal groups cannot
