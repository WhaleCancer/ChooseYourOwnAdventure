# Street Gangs

**Type:** Urban youth gangs and neighborhood-based criminal organizations  
**Territory:** Vancouver's inner-city neighborhoods, housing projects, and specific street territories  
**Era:** Growing problem in the 1980s, with increasing violence and organization

Urban street gangs operating in British Columbia's major cities, particularly Vancouver. Unlike traditional organized crime, these groups are less structured, more visible, and driven by territorial control, respect, and immediate economic gain. In 1985, as economic pressures mount and drug markets expand, street gangs are becoming more organized, more violent, and more connected to larger criminal networks. They represent the raw, street-level face of crime in the province.

**Structure and Operations:**
- Loosely hierarchical organizations based on neighborhoods, ethnic groups, or shared backgrounds
- Strong emphasis on territory, respect, and group identity
- Primary revenue streams: drug dealing (especially crack cocaine and marijuana), robbery, car theft, protection rackets, and various forms of street crime
- Often maintain connections to legitimate businesses: convenience stores, auto shops, nightclubs
- Known for visible displays of power: graffiti, colors, and public demonstrations of control
- Increasingly connected to larger criminal organizations as distributors and enforcers

**Typical Members:**
- Predominantly young males, ages 14-30, with some female members in supporting roles
- Often from marginalized communities, housing projects, or economically disadvantaged areas
- Mix of ethnic backgrounds reflecting Vancouver's diverse population
- Strong sense of neighborhood identity and loyalty to the gang
- Many have limited education and few legitimate employment opportunities
- Some are second-generation gang members, following family traditions
- Increasingly sophisticated as older members gain experience and connections

**Equipment and Resources:**
- Readily available firearms (handguns, sawed-off shotguns, occasionally automatic weapons)
- Stolen vehicles for transportation and status
- Communication through payphones, pagers, and word-of-mouth networks
- Safe houses and hangouts in their territories
- Connections to suppliers (often biker gangs, cartels, or other organized crime)
- Street-level intelligence networks within their communities
- Access to stolen goods, counterfeit items, and black market services

**In the Shadows:**
Street gangs operate in the open, but their true operations remain hidden from law enforcement and mainstream society. Their presence creates fear in neighborhoods, but also provides a twisted form of protection and economic opportunity for some residents. In 1985, as crack cocaine begins to flood North American cities and economic inequality grows, these gangs are expanding and becoming more dangerous. Their street-level presence means they often encounter strange phenomena first—abandoned buildings, urban legends, and unexplained events in their territories. Some gangs have developed their own myths and superstitions, and a few have encountered things they can't explain, things that don't fit into their worldview of drugs, money, and violence.

**Game Considerations:**
- Street-level information sources with knowledge of neighborhoods and local happenings
- Potential source of stolen goods, weapons, and street drugs
- Can serve as antagonists for urban encounters or allies with proper approach
- May have encountered unexplained events in abandoned buildings or urban areas
- Territorial conflicts create opportunities for manipulation or exploitation
- Less sophisticated than organized crime, making them easier to infiltrate or manipulate
- Can provide access to communities and information that other criminal groups cannot
- May have developed their own folklore or superstitions about strange events
- Useful for street-level campaigns and urban investigation scenarios
- Internal conflicts and generational divides create opportunities for exploitation
