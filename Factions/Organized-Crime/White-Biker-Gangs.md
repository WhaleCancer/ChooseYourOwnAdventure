## Hells Angels & Support Clubs (White Biker Gangs)

**Type:** Outlaw motorcycle clubs (Hells Angels MC and puppet/prospect clubs)  
**Territory:** Rural highways, small towns, ports, and industrial districts across British Columbia  
**Era:** 1980s expansion period, with consolidation complete by 1985

This note focuses on the **Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC)** in British Columbia and their white‑biker support ecosystem (Tribesmen, Highwaymen, support crews). These organizations blend legitimate motorcycle culture with organized crime activities including drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, protection rackets, and various forms of vice. In 1985, the Angels and their satellites dominate the outlaw‑biker scene, drawn by lucrative cross‑border routes and the cover offered by remote communities and industrial sprawl.

**Structure and Operations:**
- Hierarchical organization with chapters across multiple cities and towns
- Strong emphasis on brotherhood, loyalty, and territorial control
- Primary revenue streams: drug distribution (especially methamphetamine and cocaine), stolen goods, extortion, and weapons trafficking
- Often maintain legitimate fronts: motorcycle shops, bars, auto repair businesses
- Known for violent enforcement of territory and internal discipline

**Typical Members:**
- Predominantly white males, ages 25-50
- Military veterans common, especially those with combat experience
- Skilled mechanics, tradesmen, and those with criminal backgrounds
- Strong sense of group identity and distrust of outsiders, especially law enforcement

**Equipment and Resources:**
- Custom motorcycles (Harley-Davidsons, choppers)
- Military surplus weapons and stolen firearms
- Communication networks across chapters
- Safe houses and clubhouses in rural and industrial areas
- Connections to suppliers in the United States and other provinces

## Typical Weapons & Vehicles

While individual members customise their gear heavily, most Hells Angels and support‑club bikers in 1985 B.C. draw from a recognisable pool of weapons and rides.

### Firearms

Use the existing EPIC generic profiles; this list simply highlights what bikers actually carry.

- **Handguns:**  
  - **Heavy Revolvers (.357):**  
    - [Colt Python](./Weapons/Handguns/Colt-Python\.md) – premium status piece for ranking members.  
    - [Ruger Security Six](./Weapons/Handguns/Ruger-Security-Six\.md) and [Taurus Model 66](./Weapons/Handguns/Taurus-Model-66\.md) – rugged working guns.  
  - **Service Pistols (9mm):**  
    - [Browning Hi‑Power](./Weapons/Handguns/Browning-Hi-Power\.md) and assorted surplus 9mm pistols for members with police/military contacts.

- **Shotguns:**  
  - [Remington 870](./Weapons/Shotguns/Remington-870\.md) and [Mossberg 500](./Weapons/Shotguns/Mossberg-500\.md) – kept in pickups, clubhouse gun racks, and “church” rooms.  
  - Short‑barrelled, pistol‑grip variants are popular for intimidation and vehicle carry.

- **Rifles & Carbines:**  
  - [SKS](./Weapons/Rifles/Combat-Rifles/SKS\.md) and other semi‑auto surplus rifles as truck guns and for rural enforcement.  
  - Hunting rifles like the [Winchester Model 70](./Weapons/Rifles/Hunting/Winchester-Model-70\.md) used for poaching, protection, and long‑range work.

- **SMGs & Machine Guns (higher‑end crews):**  
  - [Uzi](./Weapons/SMGs/Uzi\.md), [MAC‑10](./Weapons/SMGs/MAC-10\.md) / [MAC‑11\](./Weapons/SMGs/MAC-11\.md) occasionally appear in well‑connected chapters, often sourced via organized‑crime contacts.  
  - Light machine guns or belt‑feds (C2A1/C9, etc.) are rare, usually reserved for war‑time or special jobs, and often **held in chapter “armouries”** rather than on bikes.

- **Explosives & Intimidation Tools:**  
  - Hand grenades, improvised explosives, and **Molotov cocktails** (treated as Improvised Explosives) used for arson, messages, and terror tactics.  
  - [Batons](./Weapons/Less-Lethal/Batons\.md), chains, and [Improvised Weapons](./Weapons/Melee-Weapons/Improvised-Weapons\.md) (tire irons, pool cues) are common in bar fights.

### Vehicles & Bikes

- **Motorcycles (primary identity and transport):**  
  - Custom **Harley‑Davidson big twins** (Shovelhead, early Evo) with:  
    - Extended forks, ape‑hangers, sissy bars, and chapter colours.  
    - Saddlebags or tool rolls concealing revolvers, pistols, and short shotguns.  
  - Some members ride chopped Japanese inline‑fours or British bikes, especially lower‑tier or prospect members, but full‑patch Angels tend to favour Harleys.

- **Support Vehicles:**  
  - **Pickup trucks and panel vans** used for:  
    - Moving bulk drugs, weapons, and stolen goods.  
    - Transporting bikers to jobs where showing up in colors would be too obvious.  
  - Occasionally **box trucks, tow trucks, or “legit” work vehicles** owned through front businesses (garages, towing companies, scrap yards).

- **Clubhouses & Static Assets:**  
  - Rural compounds, industrial‑area clubhouses, and rented warehouses:  
    - Contain chapter armouries, bike shops, and stashes of heavier weapons.  
    - Often have **watch posts, reinforced doors, and dog runs** to deter raids.

In play, give most rank‑and‑file bikers a **Heavy Revolver or 9mm pistol plus access to a shotgun or rifle in a nearby vehicle**, reserving automatic weapons and explosives for more serious threats, chapter wars, or jobs involving APEX or other high‑end clients.

**In the Shadows:**
Biker gangs operate in the gray areas between legitimate society and organized crime. Their presence in small communities creates complex dynamics—some locals see them as protectors or legitimate business owners, while others live in fear. Law enforcement struggles with their decentralized structure and the code of silence that binds members. In 1985, as these organizations expand, they increasingly intersect with other criminal elements, government corruption, and the strange phenomena that plague British Columbia's remote regions.

**Game Considerations:**
- Can serve as antagonists, allies, or neutral parties depending on player actions
- Information brokers with knowledge of criminal networks and rural communities
- Potential source of weapons, vehicles, and illegal services
- May have encountered or be involved with unexplained events in remote areas
- Internal conflicts and rivalries create opportunities for manipulation

## 1985 British Columbia Biker Landscape

By 1985, the outlaw‑biker world in B.C. is effectively a **Hells Angels empire** with a couple of subordinate clubs. Earlier independent gangs have been patched over, subordinated, or quietly erased.

### Key Organizations (1985)

- **Hells Angels MC (HAMC)** – dominant one‑percenter club in the province.  
  - **Vancouver chapter** – built on the former Satan’s Angels core; plugged into port logistics, trucking, and city rackets.  
  - **Nanaimo chapter** – dominates the Island scene and ferry routes; strong presence around the docks.  
  - **White Rock chapter** – controls corridors along the Lower Mainland and key U.S. border crossings.  
  - **East End (East Vancouver) chapter** – opened 22 Dec 1983 with hand‑picked serious criminals; regarded as the most feared and violently entrepreneurial chapter in B.C.

- **Tribesmen MC (Prospective HA chapter)**  
  - Based around Nanaimo / Squamish.  
  - Officially a **prospective** (probationary) chapter after 1983—wears its own patch but answers to the Angels.  
  - Handles dirty work and risky schemes to prove itself: enforcement, experimental product, sketchy smuggling runs.

- **Highwaymen MC (Cranbrook) – Puppet Club**  
  - Operates in the Kootenays and along interior highways.  
  - Functions as a **puppet club** for the Hells Angels—deniable muscle and convoy protection on remote routes and border back‑roads.

According to a joint RCMP / U.S. DEA assessment, by the mid‑1980s the Hells Angels control **all outlaw‑motorcycle‑gang activity in British Columbia**; no serious rival clubs (Outlaws, Bandidos, etc.) have an official foothold.

### How They Took Control

- **Local partner:** The Angels chose Satan’s Angels, the dominant 1960s–70s B.C. club, as their entry point.  
- **Conditions:** Satan’s Angels had to **eliminate or absorb rival clubs** and purge “unfit” members before being allowed to patch over.  
- **Consolidation:** By 1983 only three major clubs remained—Satan’s Angels, Tribesmen, Highwaymen—each assigned a role in the new HA structure (full‑patch, prospective, puppet).  
- **Mass patch‑over (23 July 1983):** Satan’s Angels burn their colours and become three new Hells Angels chapters (Vancouver, Nanaimo, White Rock). Tribesmen and Highwaymen are bound in as subordinate crews.  
- **East End chapter:** A purpose‑built, ultra‑hardcore East Vancouver chapter opens later that year, cementing HA dominance in the urban underworld.  
- **Police lag:** Fragmented and slow law‑enforcement response in B.C. allows the new structure to harden before serious crackdowns begin.
