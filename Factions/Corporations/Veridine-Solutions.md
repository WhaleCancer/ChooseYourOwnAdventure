# Veridine Solutions Ltd.

**Type:** Chemical and wellness conglomerate / Elohim front  
**Headquarters:** Vancouver, British Columbia  
**Tagline:** "Advancing Wellness. Protecting Communities."  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**Veridine Solutions Ltd.** is a multinational Canadian chemical and "wellness" conglomerate specializing in the research, production, and distribution of nutritional additives, food fortification compounds, water purification agents, and public health supplements. Headquartered in Vancouver, BC—with major subsidiaries and shell offices in Toronto, Saskatoon, and Edmonton—Veridine claims a proud history of delivering "health-first solutions" to municipalities, school boards, hospitals, and the agrifood industry across North America.

Their branding—**sterile, reassuring, gently green and blue**—projects calm, competence, and a subtle promise of prosperity through chemistry. Veridine's promotional materials conjure images of healthy children, sweeping prairies, pure glacial water, and "science for every family."

## Real Agenda: Elohim Abetment

Beneath the surface, Veridine Solutions is the *central node* in a continent-wide web of chemical and psychic subjugation, carefully maintained through both corporate cunning and clandestine metaphysical deals. Its true stakeholders aren't just government and institutional shareholders—but **the [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Archons]]** and their emissaries, whose will is advanced through engineered malaise, pharmacological passivity, and the slow attrition of spiritual resistance.

Veridine's quietly sinister functionaries operate with plausible deniability and high-level connections, allowing them to route prototype additives, psychoactive metabolites, experimental pesticides, and "immunity supports" right into the food and water supplies of targeted communities. They hire ex-military contractors as "facility managers," concoct phony whitepapers through PR bundlers, and suppress journalistic investigation under threat of litigation or blackmail.

## Divisions and Fronts

- **Veridine Purity Division** - Water treatment, municipal purification, and fluoridation initiatives ("for strong teeth and healthy communities!")
- **Veridine Nutraceuticals** - Supplier of vitamin-fortified flour, breakfast cereals, school milk and "SmartSnax™", used across the Canadian education system.
- **Veridine ImmunoHealth** - Private vaccine research, "improvement" of public health protocols, logistics for mass immunization and rural testing ("Canada's trusted partner in outbreak prevention.")
- **Veridine Innovation Ventures** - Biotech investment arm; covers shell companies, logistics, and off-books security for "pilot programs."

## The Additive Network

- **Pilot Programs:** Rural, Indigenous, and economically isolated towns are "first adopters" for new Veridine water or food fortifications.
- **Supply Chain:** Veridine owns shell companies spanning logistics, private trucking, food processing, bakery supply, and municipal "upgrade" contracts—each with its own layer of obfuscation.
- **Product Lines:**
  - *Clearfount™* (municipal water additive, claimed "antibacterial")
  - *GrainEssence™* (enriched flour for subsidized school lunch programs)
  - *ImmuniBurst™* (school-targeted "wellness" booster, administered via "pilot" shots)
  - *OptiMilk™* (fortified dairy) and *SunriseGold™* (vitamin beverage powder)

## Key Conspirators and Useful Idiots

- **Industry Executives:** Some are true believers in "progress through chemistry." Others are merely well-rewarded and happy not to look too closely at unusual "directives from corporate."
- **Public-Private Partnerships:** Veridine "partners" with Health Canada, provincial ministries of education, and major agribusiness co-ops, always under the guise of "public health modernization."
- **Legal and PR Shields:** Armies of spin doctors, lobbyists, and compliance officers stifle dissent or obfuscate negative press.
- **Scientific Societies:** Key researchers author favorable studies—sometimes under duress or Elohim influence.
- **Security/Contractors:** "Site managers" and "consultants" are actually ex-CSIS, RCMP, or private paramilitary, providing watchful eyes and ready muscle.

## Signs and Effects of Veridine's Influence

- **"Grey Malaise":** Targeted populations report fatigue, apathy, dreams of shadowy figures, unexplained illnesses, and an uptick in abductions coinciding with "improved" food or water programs.
- **Cover Stories:** Complaints are papered over with talk of "outbreaks," "seasonal affective disorder," or "lead pipes."
- **Suppressing Resistance:** Whistleblowers are bought out, forced out, or disappeared. Dissenters are discredited as conspiracy theorists.

## Interfacing with the Elohim and Greys

Veridine's R&D and "pilot program" documents are sometimes filled with **encrypted references to "Project Benefactor," "Protocol Veil," and "golden testimony deliveries"**—coded signals to the company's true masters, the golden-robed Archons. Executives may occasionally act as thralls, suffering sanctioned "absences" or unexplained fugue states after "strategic retreats" and late-night conference calls where no one quite remembers what was said.

The most crucial shipments—marked only with living sigils, seen only by those who *know how to look*—are delivered by [[Creatures/Aliens/Greys|Greys]], bypassing even Veridine's own middle management.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** Unaware of Veridine's true nature, may investigate "public health" anomalies
- **RCMP:** Some officers may be compromised or unaware of Veridine's activities
- **First Nations:** Targeted communities may resist through traditional knowledge
- **Cascadia Wilderness Association:** May investigate environmental and health impacts
- **Circle of Watchers:** Actively oppose Veridine's targeting of Indigenous communities

## Adventure Hooks Involving Veridine

- **Facility Breach:** PCs must infiltrate a Veridine Purity site after a surge in "grey malaise" cases; inside, they find secret labs, abduction staging rooms, and evidence of direct Elohim-Grey materialization.
- **Expose the Evidence:** Secure and publish hard documentation of Veridine's ties to missing persons, black projects, and unexplained chemical agents—while dodging PR "fixers," security teams, and official denials.
- **Intercept the Shipment:** Prevent a new batch of psychoactive agents from reaching an at-risk First Nations community, while faced by mercenary roadblocks and manipulated "public health officers."
- **Dream Leaks:** Survivors and whistleblowers start having shared dreams: corporate offices filled with golden light, and faceless managers bowing to towering golden-robed Archons.
