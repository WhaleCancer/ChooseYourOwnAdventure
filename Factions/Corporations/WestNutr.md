**Era:** Established 1961, active in 1985

## Overview

**Western Nutriments, Ltd.** (often called **WestNutr**, or derogatorily "WestNoots") is a pillar of Canada's booming food-processing economy. Rising from a humble grain fortification plant, it now controls a network of industrial farms, food labs, and distribution centers supplying everything from school lunches to major supermarket chains throughout western Canada. Its cutting-edge R&D offers two mainstays: agricultural chemicals (pesticides, herbicides, and "growth enhancers") and a mysteriously effective suite of food additives marketed as "compliance agents," "preservatives," and "flavor fixers."

**Established:** 1961  
**Headquarters:** Richmond, BC

**CEO (1985):** Dorothy "Dot" MacGowan

## Corporate Culture

WestNutr presents itself as a progressive, family-friendly outfit, regularly touting public-health initiatives and "science-driven nutrition." Inside, the culture is secretive, rigidly hierarchical, and intolerant of dissent. Employees are forbidden from discussing proprietary formulas; the company's private research division is especially cloaked.

## Public Image vs. Reality

**Publicly:** WestNutr proclaims itself a hero of food security, running *Eat Well, Live Well* campaigns and sponsoring school gardens, food drives, and scientific scholarships.

**Secretly:** Internal leaks hint at reckless chemical trials, contaminated food recalls swept under the rug, and worrying side effects from their "behavioral supplements." Some scientists claim their research is "not for human benefit." There are persistent rumors about WestNutr scientists conducting experiments off-the-books on test populations, especially in remote communities.

## Rumors, Scandals, and Conspiracies

- **Additives & Mind Control:** Underground pamphlets claim new WestNutr grain treatments and flavor enhancers are causing "listlessness" and "suggestibility" among populations—symptoms matching unexplained social apathy and passivity in several towns.
- **Missing Researchers:** A string of nervous breakdowns and "disappearances" among food chemists and field agents—whistleblowers are rumored to vanish or be transferred far away.
- **Federal Ties:** WestNutr has contacts in provincial and federal health agencies and frequently lobbies MPs. Some say they are "protected" when it comes to investigations.
- **Alien Influence:** Fringe circles claim food experiments are directed by 'outside' intelligences—or designed to make humans more docile for unknown entities.

## Key Facilities

- **Delta Bio-Innovations Campus:** A sprawling research park along the Fraser River, housing experimental labs, test kitchens, and a top-secret security annex nicknamed "the Larder."
- **Northern Greenhouse Farms:** Massive commercial greenhouses using WestNutr's chemical cocktails exclusively; access is tightly managed.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** WestNutr operations may intersect with paranormal activity, especially mind control or alien influence
- **Government:** Strong connections to health agencies and political lobbying
- **Parabys:** Delivery trucks leaving at unusual hours—headed for a classified Parabys research station?
- **General Public:** Food products affecting behavior and mental state

## In Play

WestNutr serves as:

- **Corporate antagonist** - Food corporation with dangerous experiments
- **Investigation target** - Cases involving food additives and behavioral effects
- **Mind control** - Additives causing suggestibility and apathy
- **Conspiracy element** - Potential alien influence or government connections
- **Public health threat** - Widespread food contamination affecting populations

### Game Considerations

- WestNutr provides a unique food-based threat
- The mind control angle creates opportunities for investigation
- The connection to alien influence adds conspiracy layers
- The widespread distribution creates large-scale threats
- The missing researchers create investigation hooks

## Adventure Hooks

- A local foodborne illness outbreak linked to a new additive; WestNutr's "crisis team" arrives to hush it up
- An ex-employee breaks a gag order, frantically seeking help before "they" catch her
- Sampling food from certain school cafeterias, characters notice mood and memory changes
- WestNutr is seeking test subjects for "a new flavor experience," no questions asked
- Delivery trucks are leaving the factory at unusual hours—headed for a classified Parabys research station?

## NPCs

- Obsessively cheerful PR director, always watching
- Ethical nutritionist desperate to expose what's in the "special ingredient"
- Sinister security chief, quietly well-armed
- Grizzled agronomist, living rough in the woods, plagued by nightmares after exposure to "the formula"
