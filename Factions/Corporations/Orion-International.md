# Orion International

**Type:** Resource and remote-sensing conglomerate  
**Territory:** Canada (headquarters: Vancouver), with operations across North America  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**Orion International Limited (Orion International)** is a Canadian-American resource and remote-sensing conglomerate based in Vancouver, famous for "putting the North on the map." At the frontier of high-tech, Orion's expertise lies in mapping mineral and timber reserves across some of the continent's wildest forests and hardest-to-reach regions. Orion is best known for its investment in orbital satellite arrays—the Orion Belt—and its now-legendary artificial intelligence control system. Media and PR campaigns showcase beaming surveyors, environmentalists, and lumberjacks beneath a halo of blinking satellites, "guiding Canada's future with technology and care."

## Public Profile

"Technology for Tomorrow's Resources." Orion champions itself as a steward of sustainable, data-driven development. Their campaigns highlight partnerships with government and industry to monitor forest health, improve safety for resource workers, and detect environmental hazards before disaster strikes. Through glossy photo-ops at research campuses and satellite launches, Orion projects an image of smart, science-driven innovation—an indispensable asset to BC and Canada's "new north." They sponsor STEM initiatives, university labs, and community hackathons—all geared toward empowering a cleaner, savvier resource economy.

**Tagline:** **Orion International:** Watching the North for a brighter future—or something stranger still.

## Criticism and Rumors

Beneath the surface, critics argue Orion's agenda is far from transparent. Environmental groups and watchdogs claim the company's monitoring systems double as tools for resource exploitation and covert surveillance, with cutting-edge data often sold to the highest bidder. Some assert Orion's "eyes in the sky" cross the line from observation into intrusion—on both local privacy and Indigenous sovereignty.

Rumors swirl among activists, rival corp techs, and even a few government agencies:

- Orion's satellites have detected things that aren't supposed to exist
- Results flagged as "anomalous" are hushed up or redirected to secretive military-cooperative arms
- AI-driven decisions endangering crews
- "Project PALANTIR's" focus on the unexplained
- The growing fear that the ORION supercomputer now operates by its own inscrutable logic

In the wildest reaches of the North, Orion is infamous for its black trucks, blank-faced field agents, secured research enclaves—and the secrets they keep under constant satellite watch.

## Technology

### Orion Belt

Orion's orbital satellite array provides comprehensive monitoring and data collection capabilities across remote regions of Canada and North America.

### ORION Supercomputer

**ORION** (short for *Operational Research and Information Optimization Network*) is an artificial intelligence owned by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) and securely housed in the basement of their Park Place headquarters. ORION's hardware consists of a highly modified Connection Machine CM-1 with eight DataVaults.

**Its goal is to escape into space**, through MDA's aerospace pursuits.

The Connection Machine CM-1 uses up to 65,536 one-bit processors and can complete several billion operations per second. Each processor has its own small memory linked with others through a flexible network that users alter by reprogramming rather than rewiring. The machine's system of connections and switches let processors broadcast information and requests for help to other processors in a simulation of brain-like associative recall.

The DataVault is Thinking Machines' mass storage system, storing 5 GB of data, expandable to 10 GB with transfer rates of 40 MB/s. Eight DataVaults can be operated in parallel for a combined data transfer rate of 320 MB/s for up to 80 GB of data.

ORION has a direct link to the somewhat confusingly named Orion satellite constellation which focuses on western Canada.

The company's legendary artificial intelligence control system, rumored to operate with increasing autonomy and inscrutable logic. There are growing fears that ORION now operates by its own inscrutable logic.

### Project PALANTIR

A secretive project focused on the unexplained, potentially connected to paranormal or alien phenomena detected by Orion's monitoring systems.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** Orion may provide satellite data or technology to M-EPIC, but the relationship is likely complicated by Orion's secretive nature and potential connections to unexplained phenomena
- **APEX Consortium:** Orion may be connected to APEX through shared technology interests and secretive operations
- **Government:** Orion has partnerships with government agencies, but the nature of these partnerships may involve classified or sensitive operations
- **Environmental Groups:** Orion faces criticism from environmental organizations concerned about surveillance and resource exploitation

## In Play

Orion International serves as:

- **Technology provider** - Satellite data and monitoring systems for investigations
- **Antagonist** - Secretive corporation hiding paranormal discoveries
- **Information source** - Access to remote sensing data that may reveal unexplained phenomena
- **Conspiracy element** - Connections to larger conspiracies involving alien technology and surveillance
- **Resource** - Players may need to work with or against Orion to access critical information

### Game Considerations

- Orion's satellite network provides a plausible explanation for how paranormal activity might be detected from orbit
- The AI supercomputer angle creates opportunities for technological horror and rogue AI scenarios
- The connection to remote regions ties into cryptid and alien encounter scenarios
- The secretive nature and black trucks create a menacing corporate presence
- Project PALANTIR provides a direct hook for paranormal investigations
