# Sterling Timber & Pulp Limited (Sterling Timber)

**Type:** Logging and forestry corporation  
**Territory:** British Columbia (operations throughout the province)  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**Sterling Timber & Pulp Limited (Sterling Timber)** is British Columbia's quintessential "old growth king": a sprawling, vertically integrated logging and milling powerhouse. Dating back to colonial timber barons, Sterling controls vast operations from the bleak outposts of the northern Skeena to the fog-laden forests and valleys of the Fraser. The company has mechanized, modernized, and grown savvier, but remains union-hostile, politically connected, and fiercely secretive—a shadow stretching over both forests and towns.

**TSX Listing:** STPL

## Public Profile

"Protecting BC's Forest Jobs for Future Generations." Sterling Timber promotes itself as the steadfast backbone of working-class British Columbia, holding up towns and families across the province. The company funds scholarships, sponsors festivals and local sports, and runs high-profile ad campaigns boasting of "sustainable forestry" and prosperity for all. In weekly press releases, Sterling positions itself as a guardian of rural livelihoods, always at odds with "eco-extremists" and standing tall for "the real people of the forest." Community murals, scholarships, and shiny company trucks project tough, blue-collar optimism wherever Sterling holds sway.

## Criticism

To critics, Sterling Timber is a relentless extractor and political juggernaut—hungry for untouched valleys and heedless of the warnings from elders and year-after-year haunted loggers. Environmental groups point to the destruction of old-growth ecosystems; First Nations recount broken promises, disrespect for sacred and veil-thin places, and a legacy of land seizures. Insiders whisper of cover-ups: vanishings, "accidents," psychic attacks, and sightings of things that are covered up as "bear incidents" or blamed on radical saboteurs. Whistleblowers claim the company's private security force suppresses both union unrest and supernatural events, while tight links to [[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|Orion International]] feed a revolving door of data, privilege, and dangerous secrets deeper in the woods.
