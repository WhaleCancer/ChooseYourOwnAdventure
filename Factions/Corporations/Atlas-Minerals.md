## Overview

**Mount Atlas Minerals Ltd. (Atlas Minerals)** is a major mining, prospecting, and "resource development" corporation headquartered in Vancouver. Formed in the post-war boom, it has followed veins of copper, silver, gold, and rare earths into BC's most remote, wild, and troubled terrain. Atlas is as much a lobbying juggernaut as a mining operation, infamous among locals for disastrous tailings spills, militant land "negotiation" tactics, and stonewalling environmental movements.

## Public Profile

The company actively promotes innovative mining processes designed to minimize environmental impact, emphasizing a commitment to responsible resource development and long-term benefits for communities across British Columbia.

## Criticism

They argue that the company's rapid pace of development can disrupt both the environment and the communities who rely on it. Detractors maintain that this approach, coupled with a focus on short-term gains, leaves the true impact of Atlas's operations unaddressed and local voices unheard.
