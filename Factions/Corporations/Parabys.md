# Pacific Abyssal Resources, Ltd. (Parabys)

**Type:** Deep-sea mining corporation  
**Territory:** Pacific Ocean (headquarters: Vancouver, British Columbia)  
**Era:** Founded 1972, active in 1985

## Overview

**Pacific Abyssal Resources, Ltd.** (known across industry circles as **Parabys**) is the leading private entity driving the rush to unlock the Pacific Ocean's mysterious mineral wealth. Originally a joint endeavor between a Vancouver shipping magnate and a London-based venture capital group, the company's ambitions quickly outgrew its modest beginnings. Today, Parabys operates a notorious fleet of advanced submersibles and autonomous drones, combing the depths off the coast of BC and Alaska for rare earth elements, manganese nodules, and other critical resources.

**TSX Listing:** PARL  
**Founded:** 1972  
**Headquarters:** Vancouver, British Columbia  
**Core Operations:** Deep-sea mining, oceanographic exploration, resource extraction technology R&D  
**CEO (1985):** Reginald "Rex" Cartwright

## Corporate Culture

Parabys cultivates a secretive, results-driven environment. Employees sign strict NDAs and routinely work 20-hour shifts eking out new patents or searching the abyss. There are persistent rumors of harsh internal discipline for whistleblowers and accidents quietly written off. The company maintains a private security force to guard vessels and deep-sea stations, many with ex-military backgrounds.

## Public Image vs. Reality

**Publicly:** Parabys claims to support research, even donating to oceanographic institutions, and boasts about sustainable techniques.

**Behind Closed Doors:** They are notorious for dumping rival expeditions off exploration sites, sabotaging unmanned probes, ignoring endangered species zones, and "reinterpreting" environmental regulations. Local fishermen and Indigenous communities complain of ruined fishing grounds and eerie sightings near Parabys test sites.

## Rumors, Scandals, and Conspiracies

- **Disappearing Crews:** At least three submersible crews and a research ship have mysteriously vanished under Parabys contracts since 1980. Official reports attribute this to "operational mishaps;" internal memos suggest "unexpected phenomena."
- **Secret Tech:** The company reportedly reverse-engineers technology gleaned from "unidentified marine objects"—and is alleged to move recovered artifacts under cover of night.
- **Greys:** Some ex-workers whisper about encounters with strange lights and humanoid figures during deep dives near the Queen Charlotte Trench. Company security detains or "reassigns" anyone who experiences or speaks of these incidents.
- **Government Ties:** Parabys executives maintain close, shadowy relationships with elements in Ottawa, the British Navy, and rumored American agencies, ensuring oversight is conveniently lax.

## Key Locations

- **Pendrake Research Station:** A semi-submerged facility off Quadra Island, strictly off-limits to the public; site of classified operations.
- **The Abyssal Explorer:** A state-of-the-art mother ship hosting deep-sea ROVs/submersibles and equipped for months-long expeditions.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** Parabys operations may intersect with paranormal activity in deep-sea locations
- **Government:** Close relationships with Ottawa, British Navy, and American agencies
- **Orion International:** Potential business relationships or conflicts
- **Environmental Groups:** Active opposition and conflict
- **Indigenous Communities:** Fishing ground disputes and environmental concerns
