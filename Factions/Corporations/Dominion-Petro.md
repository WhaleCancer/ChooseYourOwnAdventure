# Dominion Petrochemical Limited (Dominion Petro)

**Type:** Oil and gas corporation  
**Territory:** Alberta (headquarters: Calgary), with operations across Western Canada  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**Dominion Petrochemical Limited (Dominion Petro, "DomPet")** is Alberta's undisputed oil patch juggernaut, headquartered in Calgary with deep roots reaching back to the Leduc No. 1 boom. Dominion Petro commands immense oil sands leases, natural gas basins stretching from Peace River to Brooks, and a sprawling pipeline web pumping oil, gas, and profit across the West. Ruthless and relentless, the company's reputation for environmental disregard and backroom strong-arm tactics is matched only by its political muscle and appetite for pushing into ever-stranger frontier territories.

**Tagline:** **Dominion Petro:** Drilling deeper, burning brighter, pushing the land—and reality—beyond its limits.

## Public Profile

_"Proudly Fueling Alberta's Progress."_ Dominion Petro casts itself as a patriotic, job-creating powerhouse driving Canada's prosperity. The company sponsors rodeos and hockey teams, funds school programs to "educate the energy leaders of tomorrow," and produces sun-drenched ads featuring blue-collar workers committed to "safe, sustainable" resource extraction. In remote communities, Dominion's stamp is found on rinks and rec centres, a generous force in public life—while lobbyists work behind closed doors to shape policy and regulations in their favour.

## Criticism

Critics accuse Dominion Petro of steamrolling over environmental standards, Indigenous land rights, and even basic safety protocols in pursuit of production at any cost. Allegations circle of pipeline spills, toxic leaks, river fires, and mysterious illnesses downwind of their sites. Whistleblowers and investigating journalists face intimidation, while ghost stories among the workforce hint at stranger, deeper dangers: blue flames burning in daylight, shadows that vanish from the bodies of the sick, wells that bleed or speak. Community protests and First Nations opposition are met with lawsuits, covert pressure, or hollow "impact agreements." In Alberta's haunted fields, the company's real legacy may not be profit—but the damage left behind.
