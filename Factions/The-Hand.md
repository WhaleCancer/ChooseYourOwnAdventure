# The Hand

**Type:** Secret conspiracy / Shadow cabal  
**Territory:** British Columbia (primarily Vancouver and Lower Mainland)  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**The Hand** is a mysterious cabal of wealthy and influential individuals who believe humanity's course should be determined by human hands alone. They resist all alien influences and manipulate events in British Columbia from the shadows, utilizing a blend of espionage, economics, and political maneuverings.

Inspired by the Syndicate from *The X-Files* and SEELE from *Evangelion*, The Hand represents a human-centric conspiracy that seeks to control the future without alien interference—though their methods may be just as dangerous as the threats they oppose.

## Structure

The Hand operates as a loose network of powerful individuals rather than a formal organization. Members are connected through shared goals, financial interests, and secret meetings, but there is no public hierarchy or visible structure.

### Known Members

- **[[NPCs/Politicians/Bill-Bennett|Bill Bennett]]** (Former) - Former Premier of British Columbia; compromised by Elohim possession, leading to The Hand's fragmentation  
- **[[Jim Pattison]]** - Business magnate with connections to Expo 86 and extensive business networks  
- **[[Robert Gordon Rogers]]** - Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia; provides military and political connections  
- **[[Dr. Michael Smith]]** - Scientist who develops theories because of connection to aliens; involved in autopsy situations

- **Grace McCarthy** - Political figure  
- **Stephen Rogers** - Political figure

## Goals and Methods

The Hand's primary goal is to ensure human autonomy and control over Earth's future, free from alien manipulation or influence. They believe that humanity must solve its own problems and determine its own destiny.

### Methods

- **Economic Manipulation:** Using business connections and financial resources to influence events  
- **Political Influence:** Leveraging connections to politicians and government officials  
- **Information Control:** Suppressing or controlling information about alien activities  
- **Espionage:** Gathering intelligence on alien activities and other conspiracies  
- **Selective Intervention:** Acting only when necessary to prevent alien influence or maintain human control

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** The Hand may view M-EPIC as either a useful tool or a potential threat, depending on whether M-EPIC's actions align with The Hand's goals.  
- **APEX Consortium:** The Hand likely opposes APEX's transhumanist agenda and alien-derived technology, seeing it as a form of alien influence.  
- **Aliens:** The Hand actively resists all alien influences, though they may be willing to use alien technology if it serves human interests.  
- **Organized Crime:** The Hand may use criminal organizations as proxies or assets when necessary, but they maintain distance to preserve their legitimacy.

## Notable Members

- **Bill Bennett** - Premier of British Columbia from 1975 to 1986. He was one of the members of The Hand prior to being inhabited by an Elohim mind. This mind is the true reason that Bennett exited politics. The Elohim were unaware that he was a member of The Hand, and taking over his mind resulted in Bennett missing a check in. The fact that he was compromised is what led to the other four members of The Hand to cut contact with each other.

## In Play

The Hand serves as a shadowy antagonist or potential patron for player characters. They may:

- Hire agents to investigate alien activities  
- Provide resources or information to further their goals  
- Manipulate events behind the scenes  
- Oppose player actions that threaten their control  
- Offer tempting deals that come with hidden costs

### Game Considerations

- The Hand operates in the gray area between ally and enemy—they may help players against alien threats while also working against player goals that conflict with their agenda  
- Members are powerful and well-connected, making direct confrontation difficult  
- The Hand's true goals and full membership remain mysterious, creating opportunities for revelation and betrayal  
- Players may discover they've been working for The Hand without realizing it, or that their actions have been manipulated to serve The Hand's purposes
