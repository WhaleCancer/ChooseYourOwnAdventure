### True Mission

**M-EPIC's actual mission:** To collect, analyze and retain information or intelligence on paranormal threats to the security of Canada. Protect Canadian citizens from paranormal threats. Report to and advise the Queen's Privy Council.

## History

M-EPIC and its predecessors have a long history of fighting dangerous cults, alien creatures and paranormal phenomena over 70 years.

- **1933:** Predecessor organization created to interdict aborigine pagan cults in Manitoba.  
- **1986:** M-EPIC formally established under current structure.

Starting as a reflexive action against the loss of police officers, M-EPIC has evolved into an organized response to the wide range of supernatural forces and events that appear to be occurring with increasing frequency in recent times.

Its unique **extrajudicial sanction** allows it to operate as effectively as possible against opponents that cannot be dealt with using conventional human law or military force.

## Structure

M-EPIC operates with a small, specialized personnel roster (76 agents and support staff as of 1985). Field operations are typically conducted by small teams of 2–4 agents, with larger responses reserved for major incidents.

## Operations

M-EPIC agents operate across Canada, with particular focus on British Columbia due to the high concentration of unexplained phenomena, alien activity, and paranormal incidents in the region.

### Typical Operations

- Investigation of UFO sightings and alien encounters  
- Interdiction of dangerous cults and supernatural threats  
- Collection and analysis of paranormal artifacts  
- Protection of Canadian citizens from entities beyond normal law enforcement  
- Coordination with local law enforcement when possible, but often operating independently

### Relationship with Other Factions

- **APEX Consortium:** M-EPIC is aware of APEX's existence and activities but views them with suspicion. APEX's transhumanist agenda and secretive nature make them a potential threat as much as an ally.  
- **Organized Crime:** M-EPIC occasionally intersects with criminal organizations when they become involved with paranormal activities (e.g., Big Circle Boys moving strange cargo, Hells Angels encountering phenomena in remote areas).  
- **Aliens:** M-EPIC's primary mission is to protect Canada from alien threats, though the organization recognizes that not all extraterrestrial entities are necessarily hostile.

## In Play

M-EPIC serves as the primary organization for player characters who are government agents investigating the paranormal. Agents have access to:

- Legitimate credentials and cover stories  
- Government resources (within budget constraints)  
- Specialized equipment and weapons  
- Intelligence networks  
- Extrajudicial authority to deal with threats beyond normal law

However, agents also face:

- Bureaucratic constraints and limited budgets  
- The need to maintain cover stories  
- Political pressure and oversight  
- The constant risk of exposure or compromise  
- Encounters with threats that conventional weapons and tactics cannot handle

## Game Considerations

- M-EPIC agents can serve as the primary protagonists in campaigns focused on X-Files-style investigation  
- The organization provides a framework for government-backed paranormal investigation while maintaining the 1985 setting's grounded, bureaucratic tone  
- Agents may need to balance official duties with personal investigations, especially when M-EPIC's priorities conflict with uncovering deeper conspiracies  
- The small personnel roster means agents often work alone or in very small teams, creating opportunities for isolation and danger
