# UFO Religion

**Type:** Religious movement / Belief system  
**Era:** Emerged in 1950s, active in 1985

## Overview

A **UFO religion** is any belief system in which extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects are regarded as spiritual teachers, guides, or authorities. For followers, these beings are often thought to monitor humanity's progress, intervene for its survival, or invite the "chosen" to join a larger cosmic order. In many cases, adherents anticipate an imminent transformation of human consciousness or society, enabled through contact with such entities and their technologies.

## History

The most prominent UFO religions have emerged in technologically advanced nations, particularly the United States, Canada, France, Britain, and Japan. In these places, the convergence of mass media, science fiction, and frequent reports of unexplained aerial phenomena created ripe conditions for a new, millenarian spirituality centered around the arrival of "space brothers."

From the late 1940s onward, the archetype of the **[Grey](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)**—slender, pallid, with inhumanly large heads and inscrutable black eyes—dominated both popular accounts of alien contact and the iconography of UFO sects. Members of these groups often describe the Greys as messengers, healers, or angelic envoys, sent to prepare humanity for an age of cosmic unity or salvation. Ritual sightings, trance communications, and dream visitations are understood as sacred, often accompanied by "miraculous" cures or cryptic "warnings" delivered through intermediaries.

## Core Beliefs

UFO religions typically share:

- **Benevolent aliens** - Extraterrestrial entities as spiritual guides or teachers
- **Cosmic order** - Humanity's place in a larger galactic community
- **Transformation** - Imminent change in human consciousness or society
- **Chosen status** - Followers as special individuals selected for contact
- **Technological salvation** - Advanced alien technology bringing enlightenment

## The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> In truth, the Greys are not spiritual guides but the *bioengineered extensions of the Archons*—psychic jailers operating from beyond the visible cosmos. The Greys themselves have no will, identity, or desire: they are drone-like, empty vessels, programmed to enact their masters' manipulations with unfeeling precision. Their apparent compassion, wisdom, and mystery are mere projections—carefully stage-managed phenomena orchestrated by the true powers behind the Veil.
>
> Actual encounters with Greys—ranging from abductions and missing time to luminous apparitions—are neither benign nor benevolent. Such events serve to reinforce the prison-cosmos, torment questioners, or gather psychic "harvests" needed by the Archons' regime. The Greys rigorously avoid direct disclosure, communicating only through mimicry, gesture, or through trance states mediated by Archonic presence in dreams or rituals. When cultists or zealots believe themselves to have received messages or insights, such revelations are always filtered, incomplete, and laden with deception.

## Notable UFO Religions

- **[The Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md)** - Pacific Northwest cult founded by Professor Lionel Finch
- **Heaven's Gate** - American cult (not yet active in 1985, but similar groups exist)
- **Raëlian Movement** - Founded in 1974, active in 1985
- **Various contactee groups** - Smaller organizations based on individual contact experiences

## In Play

UFO religions serve as:

- **Investigation targets** - Cases involving cults and missing persons
- **Witness sources** - Members who may have information about alien activity
- **Victims** - Individuals being manipulated by alien entities
- **Red herrings** - False leads or unreliable information
- **Conspiracy elements** - Part of larger alien manipulation schemes

### Game Considerations

- UFO religions provide a human face to alien manipulation
- The benevolent alien angle creates moral complexity
- The connection to Greys ties into broader alien operations
- The millenarian expectations create opportunities for dramatic reveals
- The truth about Greys creates opportunities for character development

## Summary

_UFO religions of the late 20th century, especially those featuring the Greys, are not grassroots spiritual awakenings, but carefully tended fields of psychic and cultural control. The Greys, projected as angels or teachers, are in fact the mindless hands of the Archons, enacting a drama meant to imprison the soul rather than free it._
