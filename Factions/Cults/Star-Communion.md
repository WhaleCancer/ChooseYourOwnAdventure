# The Star Communion

**Type:** UFO religion / New Age cult  
**Territory:** Pacific Northwest (based in British Columbia)  
**Era:** Founded late 1970s, active in 1985

## Overview

**The Star Communion** is a New Age UFO religion founded in the late 1970s by former University of British Columbia academic Professor Lionel Finch. Based in the Pacific Northwest, the group is distinguished by its steadfast belief that so-called "alien contacts" are voluntary, benevolent encounters with spiritual caretakers known as the Gentle Masters, rather than instances of abduction. Blending trance practices, dream journaling, and esoteric rituals, the Star Communion reveres physical marks and so-called "implants" as sacred gifts. The organization has attracted attention for its eccentric doctrines and occasional controversy surrounding missing persons.

## History and Founding

The Star Communion was established in the late 1970s by Professor Lionel Finch, formerly a lecturer at the University of British Columbia (UBC) who left academia after publicly claiming "direct contact" with extraterrestrial beings. Initially organized as a support group for individuals experiencing unusual phenomena such as missing time or vivid dreams of star beings, the group steadily transformed into a formal spiritual movement, drawing inspiration from Finch's academic background and his charisma as a leader.

### Professor Lionel Finch and UBC Origins

Finch's ties to UBC's anomalous phenomena research circles heavily influenced the early Star Communion. His use of pseudo-scientific language and incorporation of scholarly methods lent the group an air of legitimacy, and some early members were UBC students or faculty intrigued by Finch's unconventional ideas.

### Early Expansion

From its beginnings in the Pacific Northwest, the Communion expanded through local workshops, open meditation events, and the publication of pamphlets promising "gentle contact" with benevolent beings. Its membership grew quietly but steadily, attracting those on the fringes of mainstream society and others disillusioned with traditional forms of spirituality.

## Core Beliefs

At the heart of the Star Communion's doctrine is the conviction that the [Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)—referred to as the **Gentle Masters**—are peaceful cosmic caretakers, not abductors. The group teaches that these beings are misunderstood, and that true encounters with them are invitations for spiritual advancement, not acts of coercion.

### The Gentle Masters (Greys)

The Communion venerates the Greys as shepherds who have come to guide humanity towards enlightenment and prepare Earth for eventual acceptance into a galactic community. Members are encouraged to trust these beings, dismissing mainstream "alien abduction" narratives as fear-mongering propaganda.

### Contact, Not Abduction

Unlike many UFO cults and experiencer groups, the Star Communion insists that all contact is voluntary and transformative. Any missing time, unusual marks, or altered states are seen as moments of awakening, never as violations or traumas.

### Sacred Implants and Signs

Among the group, so-called "alien implants" or mysterious bodily signs are honored as sacred tokens or "star-seeds." Members who discover these are celebrated and encouraged to attend special rituals of gratitude rather than seek medical removal. The cult teaches that these marks are proof of being chosen.

## Rituals and Organization

Ritual practice centers on group meditation, trance work, and nighttime vigils beneath the stars. Participants wear silver amulets fashioned after symbols seen in dreams and record their visions in communal journals for interpretation.

### Meditation and Contact Practices

Weekly gatherings involve candlelit ceremonies, harmonic chanting, and collective recitation of prayers meant to invite the Gentle Masters. Special "Contact Nights" are held at outdoor locations believed to be hotspots for cosmic visitation.

### Leadership and Membership Structure

Leadership is hierarchical, with Finch at the top as "The Herald," assisted by a trusted inner circle ("Chosen Watchers") who facilitate rituals and serve as intermediaries for new members ("Listeners"). Advancement within the group depends largely on demonstration of spiritual openness and reported contact experiences.

## Controversies

The Star Communion's history is not without controversy. The group has been linked to unexplained disappearances and has faced criticism over its handling of dissent and skepticism within its ranks.

### Missing Persons and Unexplained Events

Although the cult officially denies any involvement, several incidents of abrupt departures and lost time among members have fueled local rumors and occasional police interest. The Communion dismisses these occurrences as rare, voluntary journeys of "spiritual transformation."

### Handling of Dissent

Members who question doctrine, especially regarding the physical or emotional impact of "contact," often face gentle but persistent pressure to reinterpret these experiences positively or quietly withdraw.

## Key Texts and Symbols

The Communion's spiritual canon includes Finch's "Book of the Guardians," ritual manuals like "The Living Star," and children's catechisms. Silver amulets, triangle sigils, and spiral motifs are prominent symbols, signifying trust in the Gentle Masters and a readiness for contact.

## Notable Members

Notable figures include founder Professor Lionel Finch, inner circle leader Joanna Leech, and various named and anonymous members featured in cult pamphlets and testimonials. Some current participants claim backgrounds in academia or psychology.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** The Star Communion may be investigated for missing persons cases or suspicious activities
- **RCMP:** Police interest in missing persons and unexplained events
- **Greys:** The cult's veneration of Greys as "Gentle Masters" is actually worship of Elohim constructs
- **UBC:** Connection through Professor Finch's academic background

## The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> The Star Communion's belief in "Gentle Masters" is a dangerous delusion. The Greys are not benevolent spiritual guides but biological constructs controlled by the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md). The "voluntary contact" is actually abduction, and the "sacred implants" are tracking devices. The cult serves the interests of the Elohim by creating willing subjects for their operations.

## In Play

The Star Communion serves as:

- **Investigation target** - Cases involving missing persons or suspicious activities
- **Witness source** - Members who may have information about alien activity
- **Victims** - Individuals being manipulated by the cult
- **Red herring** - False leads or unreliable information
- **Conspiracy element** - Part of larger alien manipulation schemes

### Game Considerations

- The Star Communion provides a human face to alien manipulation
- The "voluntary contact" angle creates moral complexity
- The missing persons connection creates investigation hooks
- The UBC connection adds academic credibility
- The truth about Greys creates dramatic reveals
