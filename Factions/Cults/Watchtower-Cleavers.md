# Watchtower Cleavers (The Saints of the Final Veil)

**Type:** Polygamous Mormon offshoot / Apocalyptic cult  
**Territory:** Isolated compounds in BC and Alberta  
**Era:** Founded 1981, active in 1985

## Overview

**The Watchtower Cleavers** (also called "The Saints of the Final Veil") are a backwoods, polygamous Mormon offshoot blending folk magic, apocalyptic frontier Christianity, Indigenous tradition, and a soul-war ideology against the [Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md) as prison-wardens of Earth. They're fiercely protective, dangerous, and unpredictable—alternately vital allies in the anti-alien cause, or fanatical threats to law, order, and vulnerable people.

## Origin

Founded in 1981 by firebrand preacher **Caleb "Red" Theroux**—a self-styled "prophet" and former RCMP officer who claimed to receive direct revelation from God after a series of abduction experiences and supernatural dreams in the wilds above Kamloops. Theroux broke from mainstream Mormonism, denouncing Salt Lake City as "compromised by the jailors." The Cleavers revere the Book of Mormon (with additional apocalyptic "Sealed Records" penned by Theroux), and draw new followers from isolationist, survivalist, and fundamentalist Mormon splinters across BC and Alberta.

## Beliefs

- **The Greys ("Watchers" or "Wardens") are fallen angels/archons:** Ancient jailors sent to keep mankind's souls confined to Earth—a "prison planet." They masquerade as heavenly visitors but are in truth servants of "the Adversary."
- **Spiritual Warfare:** Humanity is uniquely chosen for freedom and godhood, but must pass a final test of "veil breaking" before the Second Coming. Every abduction is an attempt to harvest souls or drag "the elect" from the path of exaltation.
- **Polygamy as Divine Command:** Theroux teaches that in the last days, "families must be strengthened and multiplied in all righteousness," interpreting plural marriage as both protection against and a "ward" for breaking the Greys' psychic dominion. The Prophet is said to have nine "sealed wives," and high-ranking men are encouraged to follow suit.
- **Racial and Spiritual Exceptionalism:** The Cleavers see themselves as a "peculiar people," literal Children of Israel, and modern-day Nephites with a mission to redeem sacred lands ("Zion in Cascadia").
- **First Nations as Allies and Lost Tribe:** Many leaders teach that Indigenous "medicine men" and Mormon "priesthood holders" must work together, because both have keys to resisting the Watchers.

## Practices

- **Polygamous compounds:** Living in isolated mountain homesteads, they build "Zion" via shared labor, strict communal discipline, and rigid gender roles. Law enforcement accuses them of underage marriage and "welfare fraud," though outsiders rarely penetrate the true core.
- **Spiritual shielding:** Compounds are festooned with Mormon symbols: beehives, tricolor stars, and scriptural banners, as well as a homebrew mix of "priesthood blessings," iron bars, folk charms, and certain First Nations symbols.
- **Group exorcisms and night watches:** Dream-rescue rituals echo Mormon priesthood healing mixed with exorcisms and spirit journeying—sometimes using fasting or "sacred tobacco" from local ancestors.
- **Armed "Danite"-style patrols:** Faithful "Knights of the Cleaver" (often kin by plural marriage) conduct drills, raids on suspected Grey hot spots, and intimidating patrols near [Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md) or government outposts.
- **Hierarchical, patriarchal organization:** Theroux stands as Prophet/Seer; "elders" (with the largest, most loyal families) form a council; ordinary men ("brethren") train for spiritual war; women ("sisters") tend homesteads, birth children, and teach doctrine.
- **Apocalyptic gathering:** They believe that when the great rending arrives, only their compounds—ritually "sealed" against the Watchers—will serve as arcs of salvation.

## Motivations & Real Role

- **Resist with all means:** Destroy "alien" tech, disrupt rival cult rituals, fortify [veil locations](./Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas.md), and "liberate" abductees. They keep deep archives of abduction lore—sketches of "fallen Watchers," coded maps, and testimonies from rescued First Nations and Mormon visionaries.
- **Public infamy:** Their polygamy, fundamentalism, and occasional armed resistance have made them a bogeyman to both law enforcement and local press—not helped by flecks of real violence, kidnapping, or clashes with Child Protective Services.

## Sample NPCs

- **Caleb "Red" Theroux:** Lion-maned, prophet's beard; brooding, charismatic, mixes Bible/Mormon scripture/folklore. Known for both impassioned sackcloth sermons and violent rages when challenged. Claims to "walk the spirit line."
- **Sister Hope Caldwell:** Oldest wife, compound's schoolmarm and midwife; outwardly sweet, inwardly militant, keeps "veil journals" and conducts interviews with rescued children.
- **Elder Lyle Biggs:** Theroux's brutal right hand, leads "Danite" patrols, excommunicated from the Salt Lake church for "zeal without wisdom."
- **Ada Jim-Baker:** Shoshone-LDS convert, respected as a "bridge" between Cleaver prophecy and First Nations spirit work—quiet, deeply spiritual, prone to spontaneous trances.

## Appearance & Presence

- Thick beards, pioneer hats, patchwork dresses, homespun coats, Mormon symbolism mixed with runic marks and First Nations beadwork. Compounds are hard to approach—guarded, with radio antennas, solar panels, and children always watching.
- Men are armed; women wear silver/iron amulets chiseled with Book of Mormon verses.

## Special Dangers for PCs

- Hostile (even violent) toward outsiders who question their marriages or accuse them of wrongdoing—prone to stockpiling.
- Capable of rescuing true abductees *or* "deprogramming" hapless citizens with brutal spiritual methods that may do more harm than good.
- May offer PCs "sanctuary" or insight into the Greys' patterns—but only if they pass intense spiritual scrutiny (and, sometimes, a loyalty test that is more about kinship than belief).

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** Deeply suspicious of government, but may cooperate if agents prove trustworthy and share anti-Grey goals
- **RCMP:** Frequent clashes over polygamy, child welfare, and armed patrols
- **Star Communion:** Mortal enemies—see them as false prophets serving the Greys
- **Circle of Watchers:** Respectful but cautious relationship—both oppose Greys but methods differ
- **The Hand:** May have secret connections through shared anti-alien goals

## Hooks

- The "Danites" attempt to forcibly "liberate" a public figure allegedly possessed by the Watchers, leading to a gunfight and political scandal.
- A runaway Cleaver wife gives the PCs a secret map to a sacred valley used as a "veil defense"—but the cult will do anything to retrieve her and keep their secrets.
- PCs discover an abductee kept in the Cleavers' hidden "spirit jail"—healed from psychic trauma, but nearly broken by Cleaver exorcisms.
- Law enforcement seeks help in preparing a safe raid, but confidential sources warn that Theroux has received a "new revelation" involving fire and a "final reckoning."
