# De Beweging (The Motion)

**Type:** Human cult / Elohim collaborator network  
**Territory:** British Columbia (primarily Dutch immigrant communities)  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**De Beweging** (The Motion) is a human cult that assists [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Archons]] through the course of human history in maintaining the prison dimension. Some Archons suspect this cult of collaborators has been secretly corrupted by worshippers of YOG-SOTHOTH and are somehow responsible for various crises.

The cult operates primarily within Dutch immigrant communities in British Columbia, though its influence extends beyond these communities through its connection to Archon control of human society.

**Important Setting Rule:** Players cannot play characters of Dutch ethnicity, speak Dutch, or have any significant connection to the Dutch. This restriction reflects the cult's secretive nature and the danger of infiltration.

## Structure

De Beweging operates as a secretive network of human collaborators who serve Elohim (Outsider) interests. The cult maintains a low profile, operating through seemingly normal Dutch immigrant communities and cultural organizations.

Elohim-controlled agents who hunt down threats to Elohim experiments or those who have discovered too much about the cult's activities.

## Goals and Methods

De Beweging serves Archon interests in maintaining the prison dimension and controlling human society. The cult:

- Provides human agents for Archon operations  
- Maintains cover identities and safe houses  
- Gathers intelligence on human activities  
- Eliminates threats to Archon control  
- Facilitates Archon access to human society

### The YOG-SOTHOTH Connection

Some Archons suspect that De Beweging has been corrupted by worshippers of YOG-SOTHOTH, making the cult a potential source of instability and cosmic danger. This corruption may be responsible for various crises that threaten both human history and Archon control.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** De Beweging actively avoids M-EPIC attention, as government investigation would threaten their operations.  
- **The Hand:** The Hand likely opposes De Beweging as a form of alien influence, though they may not fully understand the Elohim connection.  
- **Social Credit Party:** De Beweging has historical connections to Social Credit theory through Archon control of economic development (see [[Factions/Social-Credit-Party|Social Credit Party]]).  
- **Archons:** The cult serves Archon interests in maintaining the prison, though the potential YOG-SOTHOTH corruption creates tension.

## In Play

De Beweging serves as a mysterious antagonist faction that players may encounter when investigating:

- Unexplained phenomena  
- Dutch immigrant communities with strange activities  
- Men in Black-style agents  
- Connections between economic theory and alien influence  
- Archon control systems

### Game Considerations

- The "no Dutch players" rule creates a clear boundary and sense of mystery around the cult  
- Encounters with De Beweging should feel surreal and unstable  
- The YOG-SOTHOTH corruption angle provides opportunities for cosmic horror elements  
- Players may discover they've been manipulated by Archon control systems without realizing it
