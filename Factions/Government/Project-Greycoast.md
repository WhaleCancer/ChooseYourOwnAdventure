# Project GREYCOAST

**Type:** Classified government research project  
**Official Designation:** Special Phenomena Reconnaissance Initiative – Site-17 "Grey Coast Research Facility"  
**Location:** Vancouver Island's west coast (Tofino/Ucluelet area)  
**Era:** Active 1960s-1985

## Overview

In the late 1960s through mid-1980s, Canadian security services became increasingly aware of *unexplained electromagnetic phenomena* in the remote mountain and coastal regions of BC. Amid rumors of US "Montauk Project" and Soviet psi-warfare, the *RCMP Special Projects Branch* established **Project GREYCOAST** to investigate and exploit "spatial anomalies" and dimensional rifts reportedly detected at decommissioned radar installations built during the Pinetree Line and NORAD's height.

## Site

### Location

**Grey Coast Research Facility (Site-17):**
- Ostensibly a "meteorological outpost" atop a fog-shrouded ridge on Vancouver Island's west coast—think Tofino/Ucluelet, but with a roadless, rain-soaked setting.
- The core is a partially decommissioned **radar array (former NORAD Pinetree Line site)** with shielded underground bunkers from missile-warning days.

### Cover Legend

Officially listed as "abandoned, hazardous facility – No public admittance."

## Project Mandate

### Objective

- Investigate anomalous electromagnetic disturbances.
- Test experimental equipment ("Synchronous Particle Emitters") to replicate reported "portal events."
- Seal, document, and weaponize any rifts between dimensions.

### American/Joint Influence

- Occasional presence of USAF "advisors" or joint teams, but Canadian command.
- Shared data (in theory) with "Five Eyes" intelligence and mysterious visits from Ottawa bureaucrats.

## Personnel

RCMP Special Projects Branch (with a handful of quirky "anomaly tech" contractors):

- **Lead Investigator:** Insp. [NAME REDACTED] (RCMP, decorated in FLQ crisis, now "out in the cold")
- **Research Director:** Dr. Thelma Chow (Physics, UBC, went missing briefly in the 70s after a field op)
- **Field Tech Lead:** Sgt. Alex Michel (claims to have seen "the other side")
- **Lab Assistant:** Penny ("Penelope") Baptiste, Métis, keen on local indigenous lore of "spirit doors"
- **Rotating Staff:** Often includes "exchanged" or on-loan RCMP, Army techs, and the odd American with bland cover stories.

## Local Color

### Geography

- Ridgeline battered by Pacific storms, surrounded by misty cedar and hemlock forest; cut off much of the year except by air or rugged supply road.

### Legend

- Local Nuu-chah-nulth stories about "thin places on the cliffs"; fishers and loggers avoid the area, say "strange lights," whispers through the fog, missing animals.
- Old-timers recall military convoys, rumors of experiments during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

## Technology/Artifacts

### Key Apparatus

- "Synchronous Particle Emitter" (= jury-rigged particle accelerator array; leaks blue light and warbles when powered)
- "Field Harmonics Console" (uses late-Cold War computers, dials, oscilloscopes, teletypes)
- Protective gear using **anomalite weave** or **Phenotex**
- *Recovered "artifacts"*—pieces of machinery, stone tools, etc.—sometimes flicker in and out of phase, with sticky notes in both English and Cyrillic.

## What's Actually Going On?

- **Dimensional rifts** open **sporadically** when solar storms coincide with certain harmonic frequencies—not always under human control.
- "Portals" emit cold mist, strange audio, and fleeting visions of "another Vancouver Island"—sometimes disturbingly familiar, sometimes truly alien.
- There have been a half-dozen *disappearances* among staff, all covered up; a handful reappeared, changed or haunted.
- More than once, the RCMP has closed off logging roads and run "quarantine operations" after livestock or people vanished.

## Artifacts & Encounters

- Malfunctioning radios pick up impossible "ghost stations" in Russian, Coast Salish, and Morse.
- Some found objects (tools, coins, dog tags) seem to partially phase through matter, or belong to individuals who don't exist in *our* records.
- Brief electromagnetic "blackouts" coincide with sightings of humanoid forms in the rain.

## How This Feeds into Gameplay

- High-ranking player-characters (Section Chiefs/Inspectors/Superintendents) may get assigned to Site-17.
- Missions: investigate new portal opening, recover a missing scientist, contain a "cross-dimensional incursion."
- Potential for moral dilemmas: silence witnesses, clash with skeptical brass, or risk time/space contamination.

## Potential Project Codename Lore

- *"Grey Coast"* references both BC's foggy shores and the "grey areas" of dimensional physics—and plausible deniability.
- Internal slang includes "The Door," "Blue Room incidents," and "Greyzone work."

## Sample In-Game Description

> **Project GREYCOAST, Site-17:**
> 
> Tucked away above the storm-wracked coves of western Vancouver Island, Site-17 bristles with Cold War relics and new, uncanny equipment. Ostensibly a weather station retired from NORAD's eyes, this RCMP outpost houses Canada's response to the impossible. When the aurora burns in the night and the Geiger counters dance, the agents don their Phenotex jackets and stand watch at the bunkers' edge, knowing as much danger comes from Ottawa's secrecy as from what steps through the mist.

## Hooks for 1980s-Style Investigation

- **Disappearing evidence:** Ottawa/US observers suppress records.
- **Psychological fallout:** "Grey zoning" staff for debrief or psychiatric hold.
- **Native lore vs. RCMP skepticism:** The old stories may hold truths the scientists ignore.
- **80s Tech:** Dot-matrix printouts, telex orders in cryptic language, bank after bank of flashing analog gear.
- **Moss-grown radomes:** Overgrown perimeter, looters and UFO-watchers chased away by RCMP patrols.
