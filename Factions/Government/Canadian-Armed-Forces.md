# Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)

**Type:** Military organization  
**Territory:** Canada (Pacific Northwest focus)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

The CAF's official focus is defense of Canada's airspace, Arctic sovereignty, and support for civil authorities in disaster situations. In the Pacific Northwest, they maintain NORAD radar sites, remote outposts, and joint training areas with U.S. forces.

**Locations:**
- Holberg
- Tofino
- Comox
- Puntzi Mountain
- Baldy Hughes
- Kamloops

In the news? They are sometimes brought in after "chemical spills," "forest fires," or unexplained disasters—officially described as training or environmental containment.

## What They Really Know

### Airspace Intrusions and the Uncanny

> [!faq] "Unidentified Track Reports" (UTRs)
> Persistent, quietly alarming radar contacts—flights with no transponder and impossible flight characteristics—logged since the 1950s. Most are dismissed or classified, but files exist and a few NORAD technicians know UTRs correlate with unexplained phenomena.

> [!faq] "Condition Violet" Procedures
> Special protocols to scramble jets in response to mysterious radar contacts, usually launched under NORAD. These operations are rare and always kept secret from the public.

### Experimental Projects

- **Joint-Agency Operations:** Defense scientists in the CAF cooperate with [[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|Orion International]] and top universities (like UBC) on advanced radar, seismic, and early computer analysis not just for national security—but, increasingly, for unexplained incidents.
- **"Maple-1 Project":** Rumored to be an attempt to develop countermeasures against "phenomena" based on early encounters with the anomalous (guided energy shielding, psychic research, early AI). Shelved officially, but fragments of the project crop up from time to time.

### Internal Divide

- **The Brass:** High command is methodical and slow to accept the supernatural, but understands the need for secrecy and "keeping the Americans happy."
- **Field Officers:** Some are skeptics, but a hardened few have seen too much. Helicopter pilots have once in a decade stories: "It just vanished straight up. No sonic boom. No nothing."
- **Military Police and Counterintelligence:** Sometimes used to "clean up" after truly weird events: scrubbing crash sites, removing evidence, intimidating witnesses, and funneling civilian cases toward shadowy "special agencies."

## Relationship to the Conspiracy

- **Uneasy Allies:** The CAF often provides air surveillance, logistical support, or muscle for "containment" but is rarely told the full story—unless the incident is deemed a major threat.
- **TECHNOLOGY:** The military's desire for advantage (radar jamming, anti-gravity, or psychic countermeasures) puts them at risk of being manipulated by [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Ethereals]], or of mistakenly enabling them (through ritual, AI, or high-tech research).
- **"Ghost Files Bureau":** An ultra-secret branch within DND Intelligence maintains "archive boxes" of the truly unsolved—fragmentary photos, dead aliens, abnormal magnetic recordings, and transcriptions of intercepted coded transmissions believed to be "not of human origin."

## Hooks for the Players

- A **forward operating base** is cordoned off after an "experimental aircraft crash." Military police resist the players' agency—until a shared nightmare spreads through the barracks.
- **A senior officer approaches the agency off the record**: his niece is missing, last seen near a site with radar anomalies the military was "quietly monitoring for the Americans."
- **An aged radar technician** provides old tapes: "This one's not supposed to exist. Listen to the interference just before the power spike… tell me what's screaming on that tape, and I'll buy the next round."
- The agency discovers **old project files with both military and ORION letterhead**, hinting at unauthorized contact with something "in the woods" back in the late 1960s.

## Relationship with Other Agencies

- **Respects the RCMP for order and legitimacy**, but thinks civilian agencies are in over their heads.
- **Sees M-EPIC as a political hot potato:** "If it gets too weird, make them take the blame."
- **Views ORION International with suspicion:** Used for high-tech needs, but doesn't trust their loyalty or motives.

## Threats and Motivations

- The military wants to keep the lid on, maintain order, and—if possible—exploit anything that gives a strategic edge.
- Deepest fear: **The Americans getting wind of something before they do.**
- **Biggest blind spot:** Underestimates how easily the Ethereals can hijack human systems and tech.

## In Play

The CAF serves as:

- **Military support** - Air surveillance, logistical support, containment operations
- **Information source** - UTRs, Condition Violet procedures, Ghost Files Bureau
- **Obstacle** - Military police cleaning up evidence, jurisdictional conflicts
- **Resource** - Access to military technology, bases, and personnel
- **Threat** - If provoked or if operations become too public

### Game Considerations

- The CAF provides military muscle and technology for high-stakes scenarios
- NORAD connections create opportunities for UFO tracking and interception
- The Ghost Files Bureau provides a source of classified information
- The Maple-1 Project creates hooks for experimental technology scenarios
- The relationship with Orion International adds complexity and potential conflicts
