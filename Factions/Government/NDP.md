# New Democratic Party (NDP) - The Brief Rebellion

**Type:** Political party / Resistance movement  
**Era:** 1972-1975 (brief government), 1980s (opposition)  
**Status:** In opposition in 1985, operating underground resistance networks

## Overview

The New Democratic Party (NDP) represents a brief, fragile window of resistance against the Archon-controlled Social Credit Party. For a brief period in the early 1970s, the NDP formed government under Dave Barrett, introducing reforms that disrupted Archon-aligned interests and created genuine hope—before being systematically destroyed by coordinated Archon and Socred sabotage.

## Background

For decades, the Social Credit Party (Socreds) held British Columbia in an iron grip—overtly through patronage and backroom deals, covertly as the chosen arm of the Archons. The Socreds' upper echelons were in regular—if secretive—contact with the Greys, trading compliance for economic booms, media pacification, and suppression of spiritual resistance.

However, the world is never wholly controlled, and cracks appeared as the '70s turned into the '80s: new movements, union organizers, and left-wing political outsiders gained strength.

## Their Rise—A Fracture in the Spell

### 1. Mass Discontent & Hidden Allies

- Grassroots anger over contaminated water, drugging of towns, and mass disappearances (explained away as "hippie runaways" or "Soviet plots") stoked, rather than suppressed, rebellion
- Indigenous leaders and spiritualists quietly lent their support, believing the NDP to be less deeply compromised by the "soul pollution pipeline"
- Within the civil service, a handful of whistleblowers (some with direct encounters/dream warnings about the Greys and their collaborators) worked for the NDP from the shadows

### 2. Psychic Turbulence & Archon Overreach

- The Archons' attempts to intensify psychic dampening—more chemicals, more broadcasting—backfired. Pockets of population developed "immunities," sometimes after exposure to traditional ceremonies or rebel signal jamming
- In a key election, irregularities occurred: vote counts glitched, and some "missing" ballots with spiral marks reappeared after mysterious power outages. Conspiracy circles whisper that an anti-Archon cabal within CSIS or foreign intelligence helped rig the vote against the Socreds

### 3. Barrett's Unusual Coalition

- Dave Barrett and the new NDP, although certainly containing some naïve idealists, also inherited the support of dissidents in the media, fringe Catholic clergy, and a handful of RCMP officers openly refusing strange, unexplained orders
- For a season, social reforms—expanded healthcare, environmental protections, openness to Indigenous voices—disrupted Archon-aligned interests and introduced genuine (if precarious) public hope
- The Greys' abductions temporarily dropped by a measurable amount. Cults, meanwhile, became more desperate, moving further underground

## Their Fall—The Archons Strike Back

### 1. Sabotage & Unrelenting Pressure

- The Socreds, now in opposition but still tied to the "deep state" and Archon intermediaries, weaponized entrenched bureaucrats, police chiefs, and regional media to hamstring every reform attempt
- Sudden, orchestrated "scandals" discredited honest NDP ministers. Key whistleblowers were found dead or disappeared, their police files replaced by blanks, their families watched
- In the backrooms, NDP insiders reported "the Grey Dream" (recurring collective nightmares of shining corridors, weightless forms, and spirals of drowning static) that left them exhausted and compliant

### 2. Psychic and Occult Assault

- Resurgent cult activity was unleashed, often posing as radical left or right groups to foment unrest and false flag attacks
- Barrett's cabinet was subjected to a wave of what mainstream news called "mass stress breakdowns," but which survivors described as "the Grey Blight"—persistent migraines, missing time, and eventually "loss of will"
- Parliamentary chambers and offices found filled with ephemeral spiral graffiti that could not be scrubbed away, odorous of ozone and sorrow

### 3. The Coup de Grâce

- Facing legislative paralysis, mass strikes (some subtly orchestrated by Archon proxies within the unions), and continuous media smears, public confidence in the NDP unraveled
- A final, mysterious economic panic—blamed on union actions and alleged foreign agitators—toppled the government. Some claims suggest that key financial crashes were triggered by Greys tampering with power grids and communication networks during a solar storm
- The Socreds returned to power amid a wave of "stability and restoration" messaging. The old pipeline of additives, mind-numbing broadcasts, and ritual control quickly resumed, and witnesses who remembered the "open window" of the NDP era were dismissed as fantasists or targeted for "psychological evaluation"

## The NDP in Opposition (1980s): Struggle, Subversion, and Survival

### Public Face: Disarray and Marginalization

- The NDP, traumatized by the orchestrated collapse of their government, are plagued by division, paranoia, and surveillance. Parliamentary performance seems lackluster. Some leaders appear exhausted, vague, or resigned, as if suffering lingering after-effects of the "Grey Blight"
- Mainstream media—fully Socred- and Archon-compromised—paints them as bumbling, out-of-touch radicals, or puppets for "foreign interests"
- Internal power struggles are frequent as ambitious new blood clashes with burned, shell-shocked veterans

### Beneath the Surface: Occult Resistance and Hidden Agendas

**1. Secret Networks and Underground Cells**

- A hard core of NDP organizers, former ministers, and radical staffers operate semi-clandestinely, meeting in church basements, union halls, or on forests and reserves that retain spiritual "thickness" against Archon influence
- They work to build bridges with First Nations leaders, rogue scientists, spiritual outcasts, and select unionists—forming the nucleus of a "veil resistance" that is part political, part spiritual, and part conspiracy cell

**2. Smuggling and Disrupting Truth**

- Using sympathetic networks (underground press, samizdat zines, pirate radio, and word-of-mouth), they disseminate stories of "odd government projects," water contamination, and unexplained disappearances—tiptoeing around direct mentions of the Greys or Archons to avoid immediate destruction
- Some NDP-linked activists help facilitate escapes for witnesses or abductees pursued by Socred deep-state agents, moving them between safe houses

**3. Occult Countermeasures and Rituals**

- A few experienced "blight survivors" partner with Indigenous medicine people or fringe clergy to develop rituals or counter-signals to ward off the psychic malaise: sacred fires, encrypted chants, anti-broadcasts through modified radios at protest sites
- Occult symbolism—usually spiral-breaking glyphs or counter-triangle motifs—is quietly seeded in protest art, zines, or even schoolyard graffiti

**4. Institutional Sabotage**

- NDP loyalists within the bureaucracy or public sector unions subtly slow or misdirect Socred/Archon projects (e.g., contaminant shipments take strange detours, key files are misplaced, or whistleblowing tips "accidentally" leak to independent journalists)
- These efforts are dangerous; the "grey-touched" occasionally return, glassy-eyed, to expose cells or lead police to hideouts

### Despair and Hope: Human Cost and Faint Glimmers

- Many in the party succumb to despair, substance abuse, or "programmed apathy." Some disappear; others become isolated, haunted by dreams of static eyes and voiceless warnings
- Yet, in some communities—especially those "touched" during the NDP's window, where reforms took root—a stubborn legacy endures: radio clubs jamming propaganda, schools covertly teaching about "spotting the signs," informal soup kitchens aiding the "blight-struck"

## Campaign and NPC Hooks

- **Survivors of the Open Window:** PCs may seek out ex-ministers, activists, or their descendants, who still hold clues to fighting the "Grey Blight"—but are watched, weary, and frequently on the run
- **Clandestine Records:** It's rumored that the Barrett government left encrypted files ("Project Redspur") on real Archon activity within the Socred bureaucracy, hidden in an abandoned safe house. Retrieving them means dodging both human and Grey guardians
- **Residual Hope:** Some communities still practice rituals or live off-grid, fostered by grassroots NDP programs, making them resistant "thin spots" for Archon exploitation

## Rumors and Flavors

- "You could feel it for those few years. Like a weight lifted off your chest—but the dreams came back, and now, nobody talks about hope."
- "Barrett's speechwriter—she burned all her notes, said they shimmered with eyes she didn't remember writing in. They found her wandering naked in the rain a week later."
- "I was in the union office when the Grey static hit. Half the office forgot their own names for two days. That's how they won."

## Themes

- **Resistance is possible, but never easy**
- **Human factions can partially resist Archonic control, but are always at risk of being undermined, broken, or replaced**
- **Cycles of rebellion and repression are integral to the cosmic prison; victory only ever creates a temporary breach in the veil**
- **Even short-lived victories leave behind residues—knowledge, safe havens, resistance cells—for those brave enough to pick up the struggle again**

## In Play

The NDP serves as:

- **Historical context** - The brief window of resistance that shows change is possible
- **Underground network** - Secret cells and safe houses for resistance activities
- **Information source** - Former ministers and activists who know about Archon activities
- **Allies** - Potential contacts for PCs fighting against Archon control
- **Tragic example** - What happens when resistance becomes too visible

### Game Considerations

- The NDP's brief government period provides historical context for the setting
- Underground NDP networks can provide safe houses, information, and allies
- Former NDP members may be valuable contacts but are often watched or compromised
- The "Grey Blight" provides a mechanical explanation for why resistance is difficult
- The NDP's fall demonstrates the power of Archon control systems
