# Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)

**Type:** Federal police force  
**Territory:** Canada (with focus on British Columbia)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is, above all, pragmatic—tasked with maintaining public order in a vast and often isolated land. They view most reports of unexplained phenomena as pranks, misidentifications, or—most seriously—potential covers for criminal activity (drugs, smuggling, cults, missing persons).

However, the pattern of odd cases piling up means a handful of senior officers, and a few field agents in the Pacific Northwest, are beginning to suspect that "something else" is going on.

## What They Officially Know

- **Missing Persons & Animal Mutilations:** RCMP have records of an anomalously high number of missing persons, vanished hikers, and unsolved rural animal mutilations over the past decade—especially in logging areas and near corporate or government "special projects."
- **Weird Cult Activity:** Reports keep surfacing about secretive groups holding "rituals" in the woods, sometimes overlapping with disappearances, suspected drug labs, or arson. Most are written off, but a few officers note that some cults are *unusually well-funded* and sometimes tied to otherwise upstanding community members or even academics.
- **Bureaucratic Brick Walls:** Whenever cases get too weird, RCMP investigations are suddenly taken over by "special federal agencies" (like M-EPIC) or, more alarmingly, security teams from [Orion International](./Factions/Corporations/Orion-International.md) under government orders. The Mounties are told to "stand down and keep quiet."
- **Strange Satellite Data:** Some tech-savvy officers have friends in the university's geology or astronomy departments who, off the record, talk about satellite anomalies lining up with odd cases. Some senior Mounties suspect Orion International of spying or "experimenting" on remote communities.
- **Orion International:** Officially, Orion is a friend to public safety (donating fire equipment, funding local infrastructure). Unofficially, RCMP field officers distrust Orion's armed "security teams" and believe they're hiding something.

## What Select RCMP Insiders Know

A handful of investigators—particularly in the Pacific or Northern Divisions—have quietly compiled their own **X-Files**:

- **Dossiers on Witnesses:** Long-term patterns of trauma, inconsistent memories, and overlapping "contact" stories (classic abductions) among unrelated missing persons.
- **Classified "Special Cases:"** Confiscated evidence (odd metals, mutilated remains, photos of Greys, strange electromagnetic readings) is occasionally stored at regional headquarters "for safety, until researchers arrive."
- **Unofficial Sources:** They keep loose tabs on cults like the Star Communion, but are frustrated by the lack of criminal evidence.
- **Suspicion of Government Collusion:** After repeated interference and classified orders, some believe Ottawa is hiding a national security threat far more serious than communists or eco-terrorists.

## Notable Institutional Weaknesses

- **Skepticism & Ridicule:** Most Mounties still think the few who take this stuff seriously are superstitious.
- **Overlap and Red Tape:** RCMP must frequently hand over jurisdiction to "higher authority," feeling cut off and undermined.
- **Resource Limits:** Rural posts are often short-handed and under-equipped for anything beyond normal policing.

## Sample RCMP Dialogue

> _"We keep finding shredded tents and people gone without a trace, right where they're cutting new logging roads. I reported it, sent my files up the chain—next thing I know, Ottawa says it's 'classified environmental risk' and a spook from Vancouver is on my porch, politely asking me to forget it."_

## How RCMP Handle M-EPIC

- **Professionally Respectful but Wary:** If agents present federal credentials, RCMP *must* cooperate, but many suspect they're CIA, CSIS, or Orion contractors in disguise.
- **Occasional Quiet Support:** A handful of "believers" in the RCMP are eager to compare notes or quietly share non-official files after hours.
- **Potential Rivals in the Shadows:** Internal Affairs *might* suspect the players are covering up something, leading to bureaucratic or even criminal trouble if things get messy or too public.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** RCMP must cooperate with M-EPIC when federal credentials are presented, but many officers are suspicious of the agency's true purpose
- **Orion International:** Distrust of Orion's security teams and suspicion of their activities
- **Organized Crime:** RCMP's primary focus on conventional crime, but paranormal cases often overlap with criminal activity

## In Play

The RCMP serves as:

- **Local law enforcement** - First responders to strange incidents
- **Information source** - Officers with "X-Files" may share unofficial information
- **Bureaucratic obstacle** - Jurisdiction conflicts and red tape
- **Potential allies** - Believer officers who want to help
- **Potential threats** - Internal Affairs or skeptical officers who may investigate the players

### Game Considerations

- The RCMP provides a grounded, realistic law enforcement presence
- The "X-Files" angle creates opportunities for information sharing and collaboration
- Bureaucratic conflicts create realistic obstacles for investigations
- The mix of believers and skeptics creates varied interactions
- The connection to Orion International adds conspiracy layers
