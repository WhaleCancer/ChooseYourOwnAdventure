# Majestic-12 (MJ-12)

**Type:** Secret U.S. government organization  
**Territory:** United States (with operations affecting Canada)  
**Era:** Founded 1947, active in 1985

## Overview

**Majestic-12** (officially the Majestic-12 Special Studies Project, sometimes called MJ-12) is a secret U.S. government organization formed by President Truman on September 24, 1947, to investigate the alien spacecraft crash at Roswell, New Mexico.

MJ-12 would answer and report only to the president and would control all information related to the U.S. government's investigation into UFO phenomena. Officially, MJ-12 was subordinate to the National Security Council; this was the case only on paper, so that the NSC could protect the president with a shield of plausible deniability in case of a scandal.

## The Roswell Incident

In July 1947, the 509th Bomb Group (the only bomber group in the world armed with atomic weapons) was alerted by a local sheriff that a farmer had reported discovering some type of aircraft wreckage on his land. Major Jesse Marcel, a respected pilot and expert on aircraft, went out with a crew expecting to find a weather balloon or some sort of small aircraft.

What he found instead was a debris field two and one half miles in diameter, scattered with thin, tinfoil-like pieces of metal, strange pieces of incredibly light, wood-like material, and several pieces of thicker metallic material with hieroglyphs on it. Marcel quickly realized this was the partial wreckage of an extraterrestrial craft.

The paper-thin metal couldn't be damaged by pliers, dented or otherwise altered by sledgehammer blows, or even heated by a blowtorch. That night, soldiers were sent to secure the crash site.

The next day, a recon aircraft reported a silver-gray disc had been spotted two miles from the debris field, deeper in the desert; bodies could be seen nearby. The craft was thirty feet in diameter. The entire rear half was blown off. The surface of the craft was made of the same silver metal that Marcel had experimented on, and the interior seemed to be almost like packed earth or clay.

The bodies in the sand were gray and colored grey, with huge eyes, and a tiny mouth and nose, but no genitals or hair. There were four of them, and one was obviously still alive, although not conscious. The three corpses had been savaged by coyotes and crows.

## Formation of MJ-12

President Truman organized the project around a task force of twelve leading figures in the military, scientific, and intelligence communities. The disc was moved by special transport to Wright Field in Ohio (later renamed Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), while the bodies and the surviving "Grey" quickly found their way to a facility on the Atomic Energy Commission's reserve at Los Alamos. The facility, known as YY-H, or the ICE CAVE, was combined with what was left of P Division's Deep One/Hybrid containment facility.

It wasn't long before President Truman expanded MJ-12's mission from the crash-site investigation and wreckage analysis to total responsibility for preventing further extraterrestrial incursions into U.S. territory. The president felt, and the MJ-12 Steering Committee concurred, that until the nature, capabilities, and intentions of the aliens could be discovered, along with some method of dealing with them, the public should be kept ignorant of the facts in order to prevent a national panic.

## Research and Discoveries

### Vannevar Bush's Team

MJ-12 Special Studies Group 1 (SSG1), led by Vannevar Bush, was responsible for studying the lifeforms recovered from the crash. The three alien corpses were autopsied, but their findings were simple and inconclusive. The doctors were not even sure if the newly named EBEs (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities) were extraterrestrial at all. Subtle things about the bodies—fingerprints, fingernails, iris arrangement, and epiglottis—were suspiciously close to human physiognomy.

When the chest and head cavity were opened, a foul-smelling greenish liquid spilled out, revealing several simple pumping organs and little else. In the head, a small smooth organ that was thought to be the brain was removed.

By observing the living alien, it was determined that the EBEs were photosynthetic, as the EBE became sluggish and finally went into hibernation after not being exposed to sunlight for eight hours. When plant lights were used in its quarters, it again became active.

The theory was put forth that this green liquid, their "blood," was pumped through their epidermis—collecting whatever gases were needed—then through their body and again to the epidermis, this time expelling any waste products, hence the EBE's foul smell (like "burning cardboard").

### Theories

Three main theories emerged:

1. **Extraterrestrial Theory (Vannevar Bush):** The creatures were indeed extraterrestrial, and that advanced life in carbon-based lifecycles always ends up in a similar state. Bush pointed towards the usage of photosynthetics in the bloodstream as the most obviously alien difference.

2. **Time Travel Theory:** The creatures were humans from the distant future who had returned in a time machine to observe their ancient times. The main argument stemmed from the physiological similarities and that the small number of creatures aboard the craft implied only a short-term trip rather than one across a galaxy.

3. **Construct Theory (Correct but Unaccepted):** These creatures were far too close to humans to have been a "real" alien race, and that they must have been created by the true alien race to help make the first contact with humanity go smoothly by virtue of similarity. Indeed, the aliens and their craft seemed to these theorists to have been constructed or fabricated to get the exact response they did from the government. That was exactly the case, though even today Majestic-12 is not aware of this fact.

### Linguistic Study

The hieroglyphics that had covered many of the pieces of debris from the saucer were analyzed for similarities to Earth languages. Similarities to ancient Mayan and Egyptian languages were found. Several symbols proved to be nearly synonymous in both the alien and an ancient Earth language.

Certain recurring themes were predominant throughout the translated writings, including the image of eternity and the afterlife (the Egyptian ankh was there, albeit stylized) as well as symbols for both humans and animals.

## Relationship with M-EPIC

MJ-12 and M-EPIC are parallel organizations with similar missions but different jurisdictions:

- **Cooperation:** Both organizations may share information on cross-border incidents
- **Competition:** Both may compete for control of incidents or information
- **Secrecy:** Both maintain strict secrecy, but may be aware of each other's existence
- **Different Approaches:** MJ-12 focuses on U.S. territory, while M-EPIC focuses on Canada

## The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> If you've read about the Mi-Go, you'll be expecting discussion of them here. But you won't find a single reference to the Mi-Go until the very end. The copious information preceding that point represents Majestic-12's understanding of the alien visitors, which includes nothing relating to the Cthulhu Mythos. MJ-12 knows about flying saucers, spindly humanoid aliens, and anti-gravity technology, not strange fungal beings that worship dark gods. Keep this in mind, for it is only the truth as MJ-12 understands it. The very last section explains the real truth behind the beings MJ-12 has been dealing with.

In truth, the "Greys" are biological constructs created by the [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Elohim]] (Ethereals), but MJ-12 is not aware of this fact.

## In Play

Majestic-12 serves as:

- **U.S. counterpart to M-EPIC** - Parallel organization with similar mission
- **Information source** - Decades of research and classified files
- **Potential ally** - Cooperation on cross-border incidents
- **Potential rival** - Competition for control or information
- **Historical context** - The Roswell incident and early alien contact

### Game Considerations

- MJ-12 provides a U.S. government connection for international scenarios
- The Roswell incident creates historical context and precedent
- The organization's research provides a source of information about Greys
- The "truth" about constructs adds layers of conspiracy
- The relationship with M-EPIC creates opportunities for cooperation or conflict
