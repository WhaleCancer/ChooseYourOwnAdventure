# Circle of Watchers

**Type:** First Nations alliance / Knowledge-keepers  
**Territory:** Coast Salish and Nuu-chah-nulth Nations, British Columbia  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**The Circle of Watchers** is an informal alliance of knowledge-keepers, hereditary chiefs, medicine people, and a newer generation of activists drawn from multiple Coast Salish and Nuu-chah-nulth Nations (and friendly northern neighbors). While each nation and village holds its own sacred stories and sovereignty, the Circle exists to confront threats that echo through the Old Stories and affect all First Nations land—especially disturbances involving "sky people" and "skinless wanderers" remembered in prophecy and oral history.

## Traditional Knowledge and Modern Adaptation

- **Old Stories:** Members know ancient accounts of Star People, Giants, Tricksters, Thunderbird, and "Things that Come Through Holes in the World." These are not regarded as mere myth, but as practical warnings or encoded history of earlier, perhaps cyclic, contact events.
- **Natural Guardianship:** Certain sacred places—mountaintops, lakes, old-growth groves—are watched over due to their reputation as "thin" places (see [Thin Veil Areas](./Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas.md)). Rituals, fasting, and even avoidance are used to maintain the balance.
- **Modern Toolkit:** The Circle uses CB radios, pickup trucks, and legal activism along with traditional carvings, drums, masks, and blessing rites.

## Goals and Activities

- **Protect the Land:** Resist incursions by corporations, government, or cults into sacred valleys, burial sites, and known "thin" places.
- **Guard the People:** Track missing persons, provide shelter to those suffering after anomalous incidents, mediate between the ancestral world and contemporary dangers.
- **Bridge Worlds:** Use dreams, spirit journeys, and ceremonial medicine to read supernatural threats and sometimes resist or divert [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) influence.
- **Gather Evidence:** Collect both testimony and physical traces—rare metals, odd marks, animal behavior—carefully stored, never shared with outsiders, unless lives or the People's sovereignty are threatened.

## Spiritual Power and Insight

- **The Circle's medicine people** may sense or see Elohim presence or manipulation more clearly than others—often describing the [Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md) as "hollow masks," and the Elohim as "Hungry Shadows" or "False Spirits."
- **Ritual Defenses:** Smudging, drumming, songs, or sacred objects (heron feathers, carved amulets, copper shields) can block, weaken, or distract nonhuman entities, though not always without cost or risk.
- **Prophetic Dreams:** A select few experience recurring, sometimes terrifying dreams—warning of breaches, coming disasters, or places to safeguard.

## Internal Divisions and External Pressures

- **Debate Over Engagement:** Elders value caution and secrecy, fearing corruption or escalation; youth lean toward activism and direct confrontation with outsiders, especially after pollution, sacred site desecration, or abductions.
- **Trust Issues:** The Circle is wary of all outsiders—government, corporate, cult, and even university researchers—each of whom has either ignored or exploited their warnings before.
- **Secret Allies:** A few sympathetic anthropologists, environmentalists, and even RCMP have worked with the Circle at great personal risk.

## Notable NPCs

- **Elder Ada Thlakom:** Keeper of stories, respected seer. Calm but shrewd, offers guidance only when trust is earned.
- **Joseph "Smoker" Redfern:** Young, restless, brave; runs the CB network and organizes road blockades. Hides terrifying night visions with bravado.
- **Helen August:** Urban Métis lawyer; liaisons with "southern" authorities, skilled at finding legal ways to stall corporate or government projects.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** Wary but potentially cooperative if agents show respect for traditional knowledge and sovereignty
- **RCMP:** Mixed relationship—some officers work with the Circle, others see them as obstacles
- **Corporations:** Actively opposed to corporate exploitation of sacred sites and thin veil areas
- **Cults:** The Circle recognizes and opposes cult activity, especially around thin veil sites
- **Cascadia Wilderness Association:** Often allies in environmental and land defense campaigns

## Hooks for PCs

1. **A sacred site is set for clearcutting**—agents are approached by Circle members who warn of a greater threat than "just" environmental disaster, sharing cryptic accounts or inviting one to witness a "thinning" for themselves.
2. **A missing teenager returns comatose**—the family asks the Circle (and possibly the players) for help after a "hospital cannot cure a soul sickness."
3. **A Circle watcher is murdered or goes missing**—suspected [Orion](./Factions/Corporations/Orion-International.md) contractors, but spiritual evidence points to something stranger. The Circle debates calling in the PCs or dealing with the threat themselves.
4. **The local RCMP liaison warns the agents:** "If the Circle starts moving, it means there's real trouble—maybe for all of us."

## Sample Wisdom

> "You come here as lawmen, as scientists. That thing in the sky does not respect your laws, and it laughs at your machines. But our people have seen it before. If the roots are pulled up again, there will be more than just missing children..."
