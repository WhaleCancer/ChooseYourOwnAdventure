# Cascadia Wilderness Association (CWA)

**Type:** Environmental organization / Activist group  
**Territory:** British Columbia  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**The Cascadia Wilderness Association (CWA)** is a radical, well-networked environmental organization born out of the 1970s anti-logging, anti-mining activism, and indigenous land defense campaigns. While its public face is that of a determined but peaceful organization, the CWA have a shadowy intelligence wing, direct action cells, and "outside" scientists feeding them classified or corporate data. They often act before the law, sometimes crossing lines (trespassing, sabotage, data theft).

**Official Face:** Promotes environmental research, wilderness advocacy, and responsible use of BC's wild places.  
**Internal/Press Nickname:** "The Cascadians" or "The Guardians"  
**Tagline:** "Stewardship Through Science, Advocacy Through Action."

## Ideology & Goals

- **Earth First, Before Profits:** The Guardians believe the wilds of BC are not just an economic resource but a living, sacred fabric threatened by corporate greed—and (unbeknownst to the public) by uncanny phenomena that companies like [[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|ORION]] are making worse.
- **Expose the Real Damage:** Their mission is to reveal not only clearcuts and toxic spills, but the *strange disappearances, animal mutations, and psychic harms* that arise anywhere [[Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas|thin veil sites]] are disturbed by logging or development.
- **Protect the Sacred:** Strong ties to First Nations activists and old-school hippies, as well as rogue geologists, biologists, and hackers.

## Structure

**Tiered, Networked:**

- **Action Cells:** Semi-autonomous teams (4–10 people) who handle direct action: lock-downs, tree sits, sabotage, and site infiltration.
- **Intelligence Ring:** Spies with day jobs in forestry firms, government, and even ORION; managed by the elusive "Watcher Circle."
- **Public Front:** Charismatic spokespersons stage media events, petitions, and rallies, carefully maintaining plausible deniability about illegal activities.
- **Elder Council:** Senior activists, elders, and scientists; they debate strategy and authorize high-risk missions.

## Tactics & Activities

- **Direct Action:** Rope bridges, blockades, and clandestine diesel thefts; breaking into remote job sites to plant "evidence" for the press.
- **Info-Warfare:** Intercepting ORION satellite data, hacking into company comms, leaking "thin veil" metabolism studies to complicit university students and journalists.
- **Scientific Counter-Surveillance:** Deploy "ghost teams" with magnetometers, wildlife cameras, and psychic "sensitives" to map anomalies in threatened forests. Use this evidence to pressure government or disrupt company PR.
- **Legal/PR Front:** Publish zines, stage marches in Vancouver; occasionally provide anonymous tipoffs to RCMP about truly dangerous corporate actions (sometimes thwarting ORION and, ironically, foiling RCMP plans too).

## Relationship With Other Factions

- **[[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|Orion International]]/Resource Companies:** Believe these companies *know* about the true dangers and are actively covering up both environmental and paranormal disasters.
- **[[Factions/Government/RCMP|Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)]]:** Resent constant surveillance, infiltration, and criminalization—but sometimes forced to cooperate (or give evidence) when a situation spirals beyond environmental stakes.
- **First Nations:** Mutual respect and often cooperation, especially with [[Factions/Circle-of-Watchers|Circle of Watchers]], though not all the Guardians fully understand traditional knowledge or spiritual nuance.
- **Occasional Allies With PCs:** If agents are honest—or share evidence of "unnatural" company plans—the Guardians may covertly assist, shelter the party, or furnish damaging data.
- **Distant Connection to Conspiracy Cults:** Some Guardian members have defected after witnessing veil phenomena, and the movement has occasionally been infiltrated by cultists seeking access to thin veil zones.

## Notable Figures

- **Cedar "Cee" Hamilton:** Media-savvy spokesperson, ex-science student; keeps a public face while quietly approving covert ops.
- **Old George Tom:** Nlaka'pamux elder, spiritual guide to activist youth; only one who knows about the "true guardians" in the woods.
- **Laura Tang:** Systems "wizard," runs intelligence ring—knows where ORION's data leaks and how to send it to underground presses or student radicals.

## Hooks & Plots

- Guardians *break into an ORION survey lab* seeking "proof" of pollution but trigger a thin veil event, requiring assistance or rescue.
- RCMP arrests several Guardians during a protest **coinciding with a UFO crash retrieval**, putting them in the crosshairs of several factions.
- The Guardians offer to trade *satellite snapshots showing anomalous animal migrations*—if the PCs can help free three detained activists.

## Public Image & Weaknesses

- **Praised by urban environmentalists,** demonized as "eco-terrorists" by corporations, and often scapegoated in the media for weird disasters.
- Prone to internal feuding (radical vs. reformist), and occasional leaks when cultists or spies infiltrate their ranks.
- Somewhat naïve about the real cosmic stakes—but learning quickly as more agents and "old ways" elders bring them evidence of the supernatural.

## In Play

The CWA serves as:

- **Environmental activists** - Fighting corporate exploitation
- **Thin veil protectors** - Unknowingly protecting important supernatural sites
- **Information sources** - Can provide intelligence on corporate activities
- **Potential allies** - May assist M-EPIC agents if goals align
- **Complications** - Their illegal activities can create problems for law enforcement
