# Social Credit Party

**Type:** Political party / Elohim economic experiment  
**Territory:** British Columbia (historically influential)  
**Era:** Active in 1985, with historical roots in early 20th century

## Overview

**Social Credit Theory** is a form of [Archon](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) economic practice as applied to capitalism. The Social Credit Party in British Columbia represents the political implementation of an economic theory that was subtly influenced by Archon manipulation to maintain control over human society.

## Elohim Influence on Social Credit Theory

### Initial Contact and Inspiration

The story begins with the Archons identifying an opportunity to maintain control over human society through economic structures. The Archons use economic theories to shape human development and prevent awakening.

**1916:** An Archon intelligence possessed [C.H. Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._H._Douglas) during a critical period in his life. Over the next few years, Douglas would enthusiastically cooperate with the Archons while being influenced by their presence. The Archon intelligence guiding Douglas would put into motion a system of control by expounding the theory of [Social Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_credit). Eventually, Douglas would become a willing accomplice to the Archon system.

### Subtle Guiding of Theory Development

As Douglas develops Social Credit theory, proposing ideas about consumer purchasing power and the distribution of national dividends, Archon influence ensures the theory's complexity and counterintuitive nature. This design serves to maintain control: sowing intellectual challenge and confusion among humans, while preventing clear understanding that might lead to awakening.

Elements of balance, control, and distribution within Social Credit are rooted in Archon principles of maintaining the prison through economic structures.

### Strategic Impacts in Implementation

The Archons, through individuals and groups like "De Beweging," encourage the adoption of Social Credit policies in regions where they wish to maintain tighter control. British Columbia becomes a focal point due to its strategic geopolitical position and the presence of a cooperative cultural group in the Dutch immigrants.

Under Archon guidance, these policies facilitate conditions that maintain the prison. By unpredictably affecting economic stability, they keep humans focused on survival and economic concerns rather than questioning their imprisonment.

### Long-term Control Goals

The ultimate Archon aim is to maintain the prison through economic structures that prevent human awakening and keep populations controlled and manageable.

Through their influence on Social Credit, the Archons effectively maintain control over a segment of human society, ensuring that economic confusion and instability prevent humans from achieving the clarity needed to recognize their situation.

## Narrative Themes and Implications

- **Interplay of Economy and Control:** The integration of Social Credit into the narrative demonstrates how economic theories can serve as tools for maintaining the prison.  
- **Human Free Will Versus Archon Control:** The Archons' impact on economic theory highlights the tension between human autonomy and the unseen hands maintaining the prison.  
- **Complexity and Control:** By crafting Social Credit as intentionally complex, the Archons prevent clear understanding and maintain control through confusion.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **De Beweging:** The Dutch cult facilitates Archon influence on Social Credit implementation in British Columbia.  
- **Archons:** Social Credit represents a long-term Archon system of control over human economic and social development.  
- **M-EPIC:** M-EPIC may be unaware of the Archon connection, viewing Social Credit as merely an unusual economic theory.  
- **The Hand:** The Hand may oppose Social Credit policies if they recognize the alien influence, or they may use the economic instability for their own purposes.

## In Play

The Social Credit Party and its Elohim-influenced economic theory can serve as:

- **Background Element:** The economic policies of British Columbia create a unique setting that reflects alien manipulation  
- **Investigation Hook:** Players may discover the Archon connection while investigating economic anomalies or unexplained phenomena  
- **Historical Context:** The theory's origins in 1916 provide opportunities for historical investigation scenarios  
- **Social Commentary:** The complexity and counterintuitive nature of Social Credit reflects the broader theme of hidden forces manipulating human society

### Game Considerations

- Social Credit provides a grounded, historical element that connects to cosmic horror through Archon control  
- The economic theory's complexity mirrors the complexity of the conspiracies players must unravel  
- The connection to De Beweging and Dutch immigrant communities creates a web of interconnected conspiracies  
- Players may discover that seemingly mundane economic policies are actually part of a system maintaining the prison dimension
