## APEX Consortium (The “Ascension” Faction)

The **APEX Consortium** is the hidden technocratic faction that sits at the centre of EPIC’s conspiracy web. In public, it appears as a loose cluster of Japanese conglomerates, US defence contractors, and high‑tech research institutes pursuing “advanced prosthetics, automation, and space defence.” Behind the cover stories, APEX coordinates cybernetic experiments, psionic programmes, and robotic development built on recovered alien technology.

“Ascension” is the unofficial name whispered by defectors, cultists, and late‑night radio hosts for APEX’s core doctrine: **humanity must merge with machines and non‑human intelligences or die out.**

## Goals

- **Engineered Evolution**  
  - APEX believes that baseline humans are too fragile and irrational to survive first contact or manage planetary‑scale crises. Their answer is a managed evolution into **post‑human APEX stock**—cybernetic, partially psionic, linked into machine networks.

- **Breakaway Civilization**  
  - Long‑term, APEX intends to create a **post‑national elite** living in orbital habitats, off‑world bases, and deep‑black facilities, largely independent of existing governments.  
  - The rest of humanity is to be stabilised and surveilled in a “zoo phase,” governed by soft control grids and obedient synthetic enforcers.

- **Monopoly on Contact**  
  - All significant alien artefacts, bodies, and transmissions are to pass through APEX hands. They want to decide what the world learns, what stays buried, and which discoveries are weaponised.

## Structure

- **Japanese Core**  
  - Senior leadership comes from powerful Japanese robotics and electronics firms, select ministries, and university labs that first obtained alien wreckage and equations in the 1970s.  
  - This core controls the most advanced **cybernetics, Android Shells, WABOT‑descended platforms, and Type IV/Type V robots**, as well as the deepest alien research vaults.

- **East Asian Political–Industrial Bloc**  
  - Around the Japanese core orbit key **Taiwanese and South Korean conglomerates, ministries, and security services**, formally competitors but quietly aligned on Ascension doctrine.  
  - Handpicked politicians and business families in Tokyo, Taipei, and Seoul are read into fragments of the plan, trading national loyalty for a seat in the post‑human future.

- **US Node**  
  - Elements of the Pentagon, intelligence agencies, and major aerospace/biotech contractors act as “strategic partners.”  
  - American politicians and corporate leaders provide **funding, test ranges, political cover, and North/South American sites** (including facilities in British Columbia and Alaska) while receiving limited access to Japanese advances.

- **Outer Ring**  
  - Civilian universities, hospitals, and tech companies see only their slice: prosthetics, machine translation, neural networking, “smart factories.”  
  - New religious movements and “Ascension churches” borrow APEX language about the next step in human evolution without realising who seeded those ideas.

APEX does not have a single public logo, but internal documents often feature abstract mountain or upward‑arrow motifs—visual shorthand for “ascending beyond humanity.”

## Technology and Methods

- **Cybernetics**  
  - Most high‑end cyberware in `RULES/Cyberware`—especially **Cybernetic Chassis, Ascension Uplink Nodes, Directive Chips, Mark‑of‑Grid Sigils, and Pain Editors**—are either APEX inventions or refinements of alien concepts.  
  - APEX field units are usually heavily augmented, with LUCK already shaved away by multiple implants.

- **Psionics**  
  - APEX runs its own psionic talent programmes, recruiting gifted individuals from labs, militaries, and fringe religious groups.  
  - Many of their elite operatives combine **psionic traditions** with cybernetics and robotics, serving as pilots, remote navigators, or “living firewalls” against alien mental attacks.

- **Robots and Drones**  
  - APEX‑spec Type IV and V constructs form the backbone of its deniable assets:  
    - Android enforcers built with **Android Shells, Emotional Emulation Suites, and Obedience Shackles**.  
    - War‑drones with **Environmental Packages, Self‑Repair Modules, and Psionic Interface Nodes**.  
  - Many are wired into **Ascension Uplink / Hive Relay** networks, acting as mobile nodes in a global control grid.

- **Control Grid**  
  - Pilot programmes for **cashless payments, biometric IDs, and medical telemetry** use technology compatible with Mark‑of‑Grid Sigils and other implants.  
  - Telecom and satellite equipment seeded by APEX quietly ensures that, where possible, **their networks see everything first**.

## Relationship to Other Factions

- **National Governments**  
  - Officially, APEX partners with ministries and agencies to provide “cutting‑edge solutions.” Unofficially, it keeps key breakthroughs off the books and plays states against each other.  
  - Its inner circle is a **transnational conspiracy** of Japanese, Taiwanese, South Korean, and American politicians and business figures who have quietly prioritised Ascension over national loyalties.  
  - By contrast, both the **People’s Republic of China** and the **USSR** are running active counter‑operations against APEX—sometimes out of genuine fear of loss of control, sometimes because they covet the same alien technologies for their own programmes.  
  - Some politicians and generals are true believers in Ascension; others think they are using APEX, not the reverse.

- **Aliens and Their Servitors**  
  - Certain APEX leaders see themselves as **equals or eventual rivals** to alien powers; others believe they are being guided by a higher, possibly inhuman intelligence.  
  - In practice, APEX both hunts alien assets and secretly imitates them, building **human‑made versions of alien drones, implants, and psionic practices**.

- **Independent Conspiracies and Cults**  
  - Fringe groups sometimes worship APEX prototypes or leaked imagery as gods, angels, or demons. APEX occasionally exploits these movements as recruitment pools or disposable proxies.

## APEX in Play

- **Early Campaign**  
  - Appears as logos on imported hardware, anonymous “international partners” in news stories, and slick consultants who arrive when things get strange.  
  - PCs may face APEX tech or contractors without yet seeing the whole structure.

- **X‑Com Phase**  
  - Once the Characters gain a base and research capacity, **captured APEX tech and personnel** become key research topics, unlocking new cyberware, robot modules, and psionic traditions.  
  - Every breakthrough forces a choice: **adopt APEX methods** to survive, or try to resist the pull of dehumanising power.

- **Endgame Hooks**  
  - APEX can serve as a third pole between human governments and alien forces—sometimes ally, sometimes ultimate antagonist.  
  - PCs might split over how much APEX tech is acceptable: some embrace partial ascension, others fight to keep themselves (and the planet) recognisably human.
