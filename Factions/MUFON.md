# MUFON (Mutual UFO Network)

**Type:** Civilian UFO investigation organization  
**Territory:** North America (British Columbia chapter active in 1985)  
**Era:** Founded 1969, active in 1985

## Overview

**MUFON (Mutual UFO Network)** is a civilian, non-profit organization dedicated to the scientific study of UFOs and related phenomena. Founded in 1969, MUFON operates through local chapters across North America, with a British Columbia chapter active in 1985. Unlike government agencies like M-EPIC or religious UFO cults, MUFON presents itself as a legitimate scientific research organization, using systematic investigation methods, field research, and documentation to study UFO sightings and related phenomena.

The organization attracts amateur investigators, scientists, engineers, and curious civilians who want to understand unexplained aerial phenomena through scientific methods. MUFON investigators follow standardized protocols for interviewing witnesses, documenting evidence, and analyzing reports. They maintain extensive databases of sightings, publish research findings, and hold conferences to share information.

## Structure and Organization

MUFON operates through a decentralized structure with:
- **National headquarters** coordinating overall operations
- **State/provincial chapters** managing regional investigations
- **Field investigators** conducting on-site research
- **Research specialists** analyzing evidence and data
- **Volunteer members** supporting investigations and operations

The British Columbia chapter in 1985 is relatively small but active, with members scattered across the province. They coordinate through monthly meetings, newsletters, and field investigation teams that respond to reported sightings.

## Investigation Methods

MUFON investigators follow standardized protocols:
- **Witness interviews** - Systematic questioning to gather detailed accounts
- **Field investigations** - On-site visits to sighting locations
- **Evidence collection** - Photographs, physical samples, measurements
- **Data analysis** - Comparing reports, identifying patterns, statistical analysis
- **Case classification** - Categorizing sightings by type, credibility, and evidence quality

Investigators are trained to distinguish between:
- **Misidentifications** - Aircraft, weather phenomena, astronomical objects
- **Hoaxes** - Deliberate fabrications or pranks
- **Unknowns** - Cases that cannot be explained by conventional means

## Public Image

MUFON presents itself as a serious scientific organization, distancing itself from:
- **UFO cults** - Religious or spiritual groups like the Star Communion
- **Conspiracy theorists** - Those who believe in government cover-ups without evidence
- **Sensationalists** - Media figures who exploit UFO stories for attention

The organization emphasizes scientific rigor, evidence-based conclusions, and careful documentation. However, this scientific approach sometimes puts them at odds with both true believers who want validation and skeptics who dismiss all UFO reports.

## Relationship with Other Factions

- **M-EPIC:** MUFON investigators may unknowingly investigate cases that M-EPIC is also monitoring. M-EPIC may use MUFON reports as leads, or may suppress MUFON investigations that get too close to classified information. Some MUFON members may be M-EPIC informants or agents working undercover.

- **RCMP:** MUFON investigators may cooperate with police on cases involving unexplained phenomena, or may be viewed with suspicion as potential troublemakers. Some RCMP officers may be MUFON members or provide information to the organization.

- **UFO Cults:** MUFON distances itself from cults like the Star Communion, viewing them as unscientific and potentially dangerous. However, some MUFON members may have been drawn to the organization after cult experiences, and cult members may try to infiltrate MUFON to gather information.

- **Government Agencies:** MUFON maintains a complex relationship with government. Some members believe in government cover-ups, while others work to maintain professional relationships. Government agencies may monitor MUFON activities, use them as sources of information, or suppress investigations that threaten classified operations.

- **Media:** MUFON provides information to journalists and may appear in news reports, but tries to maintain a serious, scientific image rather than sensationalism.

- **Academia:** Some MUFON members are academics who study UFO phenomena, though mainstream academia often dismisses the subject. MUFON may collaborate with sympathetic researchers or provide data for academic studies.

## The Truth About MUFON

While MUFON presents itself as a scientific organization, the truth is more complex:

- **Genuine Research:** Many MUFON investigators are sincere researchers trying to understand unexplained phenomena through scientific methods. They may genuinely encounter real UFO activity, alien technology, or paranormal events.

- **Infiltration:** MUFON has been infiltrated by various groups:
  - **M-EPIC agents** working undercover to monitor civilian investigations
  - **Government informants** reporting on MUFON activities
  - **Cult members** seeking information or recruits
  - **The Hand** or other conspiracy organizations using MUFON as a cover

- **Manipulation:** Some MUFON investigations may be deliberately steered away from sensitive information, or investigators may be fed false information to mislead them.

- **Real Encounters:** MUFON investigators may encounter genuine alien activity, Greys, Elohim, or other supernatural phenomena, though they may not understand the true nature of what they're witnessing.

- **Danger:** Investigators who get too close to the truth may face threats, disappearances, or "accidents" arranged by those who want to keep secrets hidden.

## Notable Members (1985 BC Chapter)

- **Dr. Sarah Chen** - Field investigator and former UBC researcher, specializes in physical evidence analysis
- **Marcus "Mac" O'Brien** - Retired RCMP officer, serves as MUFON's liaison with law enforcement
- **Patricia "Pat" Morrison** - Amateur astronomer and photographer, documents sightings and analyzes photographic evidence
- **Robert "Bob" Kim** - Engineer and electronics specialist, investigates cases involving electromagnetic effects

## Investigation Focus Areas (1985 BC)

The BC chapter focuses on several areas of interest:
- **Vancouver area sightings** - Urban and suburban UFO reports
- **Remote area encounters** - Sightings in wilderness and rural areas
- **Missing time cases** - Reports involving lost time or memory gaps
- **Physical trace cases** - Landing sites, crop circles, or other physical evidence
- **Witness testimony** - Systematic documentation of contact experiences

## In Play

MUFON serves as:

- **Information Source** - Players may access MUFON databases, reports, or investigators for information about UFO activity
- **Investigation Resource** - MUFON investigators may provide expertise, equipment, or field support for investigations
- **Witness Network** - MUFON maintains contacts with witnesses who may have valuable information
- **Cover Organization** - Players may use MUFON membership as cover for their own investigations
- **Complication** - MUFON investigations may interfere with classified operations or draw unwanted attention
- **Red Herring** - Some MUFON cases may be misidentifications or hoaxes that waste time
- **Danger Zone** - Investigators who discover too much may become targets

### Game Considerations

- MUFON provides a legitimate civilian organization for UFO investigation
- The scientific approach contrasts with cults and conspiracy theories
- The organization can serve as both ally and obstacle depending on the situation
- Infiltration and manipulation create opportunities for intrigue and betrayal
- Real encounters mixed with misidentifications create uncertainty and investigation challenges
- The organization's decentralized structure allows for diverse NPCs and storylines

## Sample Investigation Hooks

- A MUFON investigator disappears after reporting a "major breakthrough" in a case
- MUFON files contain information about a case the players are investigating, but key pages are missing
- A MUFON member approaches the players with evidence they're afraid to report through official channels
- Players discover that a MUFON investigator is actually an M-EPIC agent working undercover
- MUFON's investigation of a sighting threatens to expose a classified government operation
- A MUFON conference becomes the site of a paranormal event or alien encounter
