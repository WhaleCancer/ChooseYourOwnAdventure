## Sample NPCs

- **Hendrik van der Meer:** Deacon, pillar of the Dutch Christian Reformed Church, known for his silence and impossibly blue eyes. Acts as local "handler," storing Elohim devices in his immaculate barn.
- **Elsje Vos:** Teacher and church choir director; can sing notes that make witnesses forget, and is a psychic relay for Elohim commands during services.
- **Pieter Lung:** Soft-spoken, works at the local Social Credit office; responsible for monitoring [[Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas|thin veil sites]] near Okanagan Lake under the guise of land use administration.

## Signs and Weaknesses

- **Supernatural "Tell":** Cameras malfunction when pointed at their faces; animals react with terror or unnatural calm.
- **Cracks in the Armor:** Some hybrids, upon encountering overwhelming spiritual purity (native rituals, true faith, deep love), briefly lose control—experiencing episodes of emotion or memory they cannot process.
- **Urban Legends:** In Dutch farming communities, stories circle about "the Old Families"—never sick, always there when trouble comes, sometimes glimpsed talking to strangers who are never seen again.
- The hybrid nature creates body horror and identity crisis elements
- The Men in Black angle adds classic X-Files elements
- The programming creates opportunities for redemption or resistance scenarios
