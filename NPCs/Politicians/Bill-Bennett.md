# Bill Bennett

**Type:** Politician / Former Hand member  
**Role:** Premier of British Columbia (1975-1986)  
**Era:** 1975-1986

## Overview

**Bill Bennett** was Premier of British Columbia from 1975 to 1986, a powerful figure in provincial politics, leading significant infrastructure projects and economic reforms.

Bill Bennett retired as the Premier of British Columbia in 1986 for a combination of personal and political reasons. Having served as Premier since 1975, Bennett had overseen significant and sometimes controversial changes in British Columbia's economy and government policies, particularly through his "restraint" program which aimed at reducing government spending and controlling inflation. After more than a decade in office, Bennett likely felt it was time for a new leader to bring fresh energy and ideas to the party and the province.

## The Truth

> [!TRUTH]
> He was one of the members of [[Factions/The-Hand|The Hand]] prior to being inhabited by an [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Elohim]] mind. This mind is the true reason that Bennett exited politics. The Elohim were unaware that he was a member of The Hand, and taking over his mind resulted in Bennett missing a check in. The fact that he was compromised is what led to the other four members of The Hand to cut contact with each other.

His retirement opened the door for Bill Vander Zalm, who succeeded him as the leader of the [[Factions/Social-Credit-Party|Social Credit Party]] and then as Premier of British Columbia. Vander Zalm was a charismatic figure with a populist style, and his leadership marked a shift in focus and approach from Bennett's era. While Bennett's departure was part of the natural political cycle, it was significant in setting the stage for a new chapter in BC's political landscape.
