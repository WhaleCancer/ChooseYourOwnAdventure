Their location along transportation corridors makes them valuable for various activities beyond entertainment.

**In the Shadows:**
Highway strip clubs are strategically positioned along transportation routes, making them valuable for various criminal activities. The transient nature of the clientele and the location along major routes create opportunities for discrete meetings, smuggling operations, and other activities that require movement and anonymity. Some clubs may serve as waypoints for drug trafficking, human smuggling, or other transportation-related criminal activities. The location along highways means these establishments may have connections to trucking companies, smuggling networks, or other organizations that use transportation routes for illegal activities. The transient population also means that strange events or unexplained phenomena may go unnoticed or unreported, as witnesses are unlikely to remain in the area.

**Game Considerations:**
- Information gathering locations with access to travelers and transportation workers
- Potential sources of information about highway activities, smuggling, or transportation-related criminal activities
- May have connections to smuggling networks or drug trafficking operations
- Meeting places for discrete business transactions involving transportation or movement
- Dancers and staff may have knowledge of highway activities, trucking, or criminal operations
- Location along transportation routes creates opportunities for scenarios involving movement or smuggling
- May serve as waypoints for criminal activities that require transportation
- Transient nature means information may be time-sensitive or unreliable
- Useful for scenarios involving highway travel, trucking, or transportation-related investigations
- Strategic locations make them valuable for operations requiring movement or anonymity
