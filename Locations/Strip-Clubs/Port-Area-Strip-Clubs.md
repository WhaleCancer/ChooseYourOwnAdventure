Port-area strip clubs in 1985 British Columbia cater to the unique clientele of maritime workers: sailors, dock workers, longshoremen, and others who work in or around ports.

**In the Shadows:**
Port-area strip clubs are uniquely positioned at the intersection of legitimate commerce and criminal activity. The international nature of shipping means these establishments may have connections to smuggling operations, human trafficking, or other activities that exploit maritime transportation. The transient population creates opportunities for discrete meetings and business transactions that can occur without leaving a permanent record. Some clubs may serve as waypoints for illegal activities, with connections to smuggling networks, human traffickers, or other criminal organizations that use ports for their operations. The diverse, international clientele means these establishments may have knowledge of or connections to criminal activities spanning multiple countries.
