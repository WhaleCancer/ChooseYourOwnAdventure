Biker-controlled strip clubs in 1985 British Columbia are establishments owned, operated, or protected by outlaw motorcycle clubs. These clubs serve multiple functions: legitimate revenue streams, meeting places for gang members, fronts for illegal activities, and symbols of territorial control. They're often rougher and more dangerous than other strip clubs, with a strong biker culture presence and clear connections to organized crime.

- Located in areas with strong biker presence: industrial districts, small towns, highway routes
- May have clubhouses attached or nearby
- Often feature live music, especially rock or country

**Typical Clientele:**
- Biker gang members and associates (primary clientele)

- People looking to avoid attention or conduct discrete business
- Those involved in criminal activities who need biker protection or services

**Operations:**
- Owned or controlled by biker gangs, with gang members in management or security roles
- Often fronts for illegal activities: drug dealing, weapons trafficking, money laundering

**In the Shadows:**
Biker-controlled strip clubs are central to the operations of outlaw motorcycle clubs. They serve as meeting places, operational bases, and symbols of territorial control. The gang presence means these establishments are deeply integrated into criminal networks, with connections to drug distribution, weapons trafficking, and other illegal activities. Dancers and staff often have direct connections to gang members, making them valuable sources of information but also putting them at risk. These clubs may be neutral ground where different criminal groups can meet, or they may be strictly controlled territories where outsiders are not welcome. The rough atmosphere and criminal connections make them dangerous places, but also valuable sources of information about biker gang activities and the broader criminal underworld.

**Game Considerations:**
- Information gathering locations with direct access to biker gang members and activities
- Meeting places for criminal elements, especially those connected to biker gangs
- Potential sources of information about biker gang operations, rivalries, and criminal activities
- May be fronts for illegal activities that players can investigate
- Dancers and staff may have valuable information but are also at risk from gang members
- Security personnel are gang members, making them both sources of information and dangerous adversaries
- May serve as operational bases that players can infiltrate or raid
- Connections to other biker-controlled businesses and criminal networks
- Dangerous locations where violence can erupt quickly
- Useful for scenarios involving biker gangs or rural criminal activities
