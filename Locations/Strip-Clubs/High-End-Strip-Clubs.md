High-end strip clubs in 1985 British Columbia cater to wealthier clientele: businessmen, professionals, tourists, and those willing to pay premium prices for a more refined experience. These establishments operate with greater legitimacy than their lower-end counterparts, maintaining better relationships with authorities while still operating in legal gray areas. They're designed to provide an upscale experience that feels more like an exclusive club than a seedy strip joint.

**In the Shadows:**
High-end strip clubs serve as meeting places for powerful people who want to conduct business away from prying eyes. The upscale atmosphere and emphasis on discretion make them ideal for sensitive meetings, whether legitimate or criminal. Some clubs have developed reputations as places where deals are made, information is exchanged, and relationships are built. The wealthy clientele means these establishments may have connections to political figures, business leaders, or other influential people. The sophisticated operations and legitimate fronts make them attractive for money laundering and other financial crimes that require a veneer of respectability.

**Game Considerations:**
- Meeting places for high-level contacts, whether legitimate or criminal
- Information gathering locations with access to influential people
- Potential sources of information about business, politics, or organized crime
- May be fronts for sophisticated criminal activities that require investigation
- Dancers and staff may have knowledge of powerful people and their activities
- VIP areas provide opportunities for private meetings with important contacts
- High cash flow and legitimate fronts make them attractive for money laundering
- Connections to political or business figures may be relevant to investigations
- More difficult to infiltrate or investigate due to security and discretion
- Useful for scenarios involving wealthy or influential NPCs
