# Seedy Motels

**Type:** Low-cost motels and hotels, often in disrepair  
**Atmosphere:** Run-down, transient, with an air of desperation  
**Typical Locations:** Highway strips, industrial areas, near ports, urban fringes

Seedy motels in 1985 British Columbia serve the needs of those requiring cheap, anonymous accommodation: travelers on tight budgets, people conducting illicit business, sex workers and their clients, criminals needing temporary safe houses, and those simply down on their luck. These establishments are often poorly maintained, minimally staffed, and operate with a "don't ask, don't tell" philosophy that makes them attractive for various illegal activities.

**Physical Description:**
- Single or two-story buildings with exterior room access
- Faded paint, broken fixtures, and signs of deferred maintenance
- Small rooms with basic furniture, often outdated and worn
- Minimal amenities: basic bathrooms, sometimes kitchenettes, often no phones or unreliable service
- Parking lots with poor lighting, sometimes with vehicles left for extended periods
- Office areas that may be minimally staffed or automated
- Located along highways, in industrial districts, or in economically depressed areas

**Typical Occupants:**
- Travelers seeking cheap accommodation
- People conducting illicit business or meetings
- Sex workers and their clients
- Criminals using rooms as temporary safe houses or meeting places
- People avoiding attention: fugitives, those hiding from someone, witnesses in protection
- Those down on their luck: people between housing, dealing with personal crises
- Smugglers and those involved in cross-border activities

**Operations:**
- Cash-based businesses with minimal record-keeping
- Often operate with a "don't ask, don't tell" philosophy
- Some motels are fronts for illegal activities: drug dealing, prostitution, human trafficking
- Staff may be complicit in or turn a blind eye to illegal activities
- Rooms may be rented by the hour, day, or week
- Minimal security, making them attractive for criminal use
- Some locations may be owned or controlled by criminal organizations

**In the Shadows:**
Seedy motels serve as anonymous spaces where people can conduct business, hide, or simply exist without drawing attention. The transient nature of the clientele and the minimal oversight make them ideal for various illegal activities. Some motels have developed reputations within criminal circles as safe places to conduct business or lay low. The isolation and anonymity can also make them locations where strange events go unnoticed or unreported. Staff and long-term residents may have knowledge of local happenings, criminal activity, or unexplained events, but the transient nature means information is often fragmentary and unreliable.

**Game Considerations:**
- Anonymous accommodation for players needing to avoid attention
- Meeting places for discrete business or criminal activities
- Potential sources of information from staff or long-term residents
- May be fronts for illegal activities that players can investigate
- Safe houses for criminals that players may need to locate or raid
- Locations where strange events may occur without attracting attention
- Minimal security makes them easier to infiltrate or investigate
- Cash-based operations may be fronts for money laundering
- Transient nature means witnesses may be unreliable or unavailable
- Some locations may have connections to human trafficking or organized crime
