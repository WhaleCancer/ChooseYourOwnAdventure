# No-Tell Motels

**Type:** Motels specifically catering to discrete, often illicit activities  
**Atmosphere:** Intentionally anonymous, with an emphasis on privacy  
**Typical Locations:** Urban fringes, highway strips, near ports or border crossings

No-tell motels are establishments that have developed reputations for providing maximum privacy and minimal questions. In 1985 British Columbia, these locations cater to those requiring absolute discretion: people having affairs, sex workers and their clients, criminals conducting business, and anyone else who needs to avoid attention. They're often cleaner and better maintained than seedy motels, but their business model depends on anonymity and turning a blind eye to activities that might concern other establishments.

**Physical Description:**
- Well-maintained but intentionally nondescript exteriors
- Rooms with separate entrances, often with minimal interaction with staff
- Clean, functional rooms with basic amenities
- Parking arranged for privacy and discrete vehicle access
- Minimal signage, sometimes operating under generic names
- Located in areas that provide privacy without being too remote
- Some may have security features: cameras, gates, or staff trained to notice threats

**Typical Occupants:**
- People having affairs or conducting discrete personal business
- Sex workers and their clients seeking privacy
- Criminals using rooms for meetings, safe houses, or business transactions
- People avoiding attention: witnesses, those in hiding, individuals avoiding someone
- Businesspeople conducting sensitive meetings
- Those involved in activities requiring absolute discretion

**Operations:**
- Cash-based or credit card transactions with minimal record-keeping
- Staff trained to be discreet and avoid asking questions
- Some locations may be fronts for illegal activities
- Rooms may be rented by the hour with special rates for extended stays
- May have connections to criminal organizations or serve as operational bases
- Security may be more sophisticated than typical motels, focused on privacy rather than safety
- Some locations may offer additional services: message services, package receiving, discrete transportation

**In the Shadows:**
No-tell motels serve as hubs for discrete activities of all kinds. Their emphasis on privacy and anonymity makes them attractive for criminal operations, but also for legitimate activities requiring discretion. Some locations have developed reputations within specific circles—criminal organizations, sex workers, or others—as safe places to conduct business. The staff's training in discretion means they may have significant knowledge of local happenings and criminal activity, but they're unlikely to share it without proper motivation. These establishments may also serve as waypoints for smuggling operations, human trafficking, or other activities requiring discrete transportation and accommodation.

**Game Considerations:**
- Anonymous accommodation for players needing absolute discretion
- Meeting places for sensitive business or criminal activities
- Potential sources of information from staff, though they require proper approach
- May be fronts for illegal activities that players can investigate
- Safe houses for criminals that players may need to locate or monitor
- Locations where players can conduct operations without drawing attention
- Staff may be valuable contacts if properly approached, but are trained in discretion
- May have connections to criminal organizations or serve as operational bases
- Security focused on privacy may detect player surveillance or investigation
- Useful for scenarios involving discrete meetings, surveillance, or infiltration
