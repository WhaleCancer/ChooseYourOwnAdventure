Archaeological records indicate that Aboriginal people were already living in the Vancouver area from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.

The Squamish, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard) peoples of the Coast Salish group had villages in various parts of present-day Vancouver, such as Stanley Park, False Creek, Kitsilano, Point Grey and near the mouth of the Fraser River.
