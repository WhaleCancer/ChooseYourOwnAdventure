# Occult Bookstores and Esoteric Shops

**Type:** Specialty bookstores, esoteric suppliers, and new-age shops  
**Atmosphere:** Quiet, cluttered, and faintly unsettling—whether earnest or theatrical  
**Typical Locations:** Downtown side streets, above-basement storefronts, near universities, in aging commercial strips

Occult bookstores in 1985 British Columbia occupy a strange niche between counterculture, religion, and con artistry. Some are sincere spiritual or academic spaces; others are tourist traps selling incense and paperback horoscopes; a few are deeper fronts for groups who take the unseen very seriously. In a province increasingly affected by strange phenomena, these shops attract those who sense something is wrong—and those who already know.

**Physical Description:**
- Narrow aisles crammed with shelves of books on magic, religion, folklore, conspiracy, and fringe science
- Glass cases displaying tarot decks, talismans, ritual tools, crystals, candles, and strange curios
- Bulletin boards covered in flyers for meditation classes, seances, support groups, and “alternative research”
- Smell of incense, old paper, and dust; lighting that ranges from cozy to gloomily theatrical
- Back rooms, basements, or upstairs spaces used for readings, meetings, and private instruction
- Often located in older buildings with creaking floors, odd acoustics, and questionable wiring

**Typical Clientele:**
- Students, academics, and hobbyists interested in mythology, religion, or folklore
- New-age seekers, spiritual wanderers, and people chasing meaning or healing
- Fringe researchers, conspiracy theorists, and amateur investigators of the strange
- Occult practitioners ranging from dabblers to serious ritualists
- Members or recruiters from cults, secret societies, or esoteric orders
- Law enforcement or journalists quietly sniffing around after unexplained incidents

**Operations:**
- Legitimate small businesses that survive on a mix of book sales, supplies, and paid services (readings, classes)
- Some serve as informal libraries or archives of rare local folklore, out-of-print texts, and homemade pamphlets
- A few act as supply hubs for serious practitioners, importing unusual materials or quietly passing along “found” items
- May offer private consultations that stray into blackmail, recruitment, or intelligence gathering
- Staff often maintain networks with other shops, used bookstores, and niche academic circles
- Certain locations use the storefront as a cover for more secretive organizations meeting after hours

**In the Shadows:**
Occult bookstores are natural convergence points for people who notice patterns others ignore. Owners and long-term staff hear about strange dreams, haunted buildings, missing time, and “things in the woods” from customers who don’t dare go to the police. Some shops maintain private files on recurring names, locations, and phenomena, building their own maps of the province’s invisible fault lines. A few are actively involved: steering artifacts into or out of circulation, quietly warning certain customers, or selling dangerous knowledge to those who insist. Criminal factions sometimes dismiss these places as harmless eccentricities—until someone realizes that a shopkeeper has better intel on the province’s weird hotspots than most smugglers or cops.

**Game Considerations:**
- **Information nexus for weirdness:** Ideal starting points for investigations into strange phenomena, local legends, or occult history.
- **Gateways to deeper groups:** Shops can be fronts or gateways for cults, secret societies, or government research programs.
- **Moral ambiguity:** Staff may help PCs sincerely, manipulate them for their own agendas, or test them before revealing anything real.
- **Sources of dangerous tools:** PCs can acquire rituals, artifacts, or information that help them—at a cost they don’t fully understand.
- **Cross-faction leverage:** Shopkeepers who trade in secrets may know about criminal operations, police cases, and supernatural threats alike.
- **Recurring contact point:** Returning to the same shop lets you track how the world is changing through what’s on the shelves, who’s asking questions, and which flyers quietly disappear.
