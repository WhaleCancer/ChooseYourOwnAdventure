**Era:** 1985

## Overview

Kelowna (/kəˈloʊnə/ kə-LOH-nə) is a city on Okanagan Lake in the Okanagan Valley in the southern interior of British Columbia, Canada. The name Kelowna derives from the Okanagan word kiʔláwnaʔ, referring to a grizzly bear.

With a population of 59,196 in the 1981 census, Kelowna is the province's third-largest metropolitan area (after Vancouver and Victoria).

## History

The exact dates of the first settlement in the Okanagan Valley are unknown, but a northern migration led to the habitation of this area some 9,000 years ago. The Indigenous Syilx people are the first known inhabitants of the region where they continue to live today.

In 1811, David Stuart travelled to the Okanagan Valley, becoming the first European to do so. Despite this, it was not until 1859 that Father Pandosy, a French Roman Catholic Oblate missionary, became the first European to settle there. Pandosy's settlement was located at l'Anse au Sable (Bay of Sand), which he named in reference to its sandy shoreline. Although the population remained small for the rest of the 19th century, sustenance fruit growing expanded in Kelowna during the 1870s, and by the 1890s, commercial agriculture had become firmly established.

Kelowna was officially incorporated on May 4, 1905, with a population of 600. The town's first mayor was Henry Raymer.

### The 1969 Sonic Boom

On August 6, 1969, a sonic boom from a nearby air show broke a quarter million dollars worth of glass, injuring six people. The destruction was caused by a member of the United States Blue Angels during a practice routine when the pilot accidentally broke the sound barrier while flying too low.

> [!Danger] The Truth
> The sonic boom of 1969 was caused by a test flight of the Avro Arrow with an engine designed with insights from DRDC Toronto's examination of surviving components of the Shag Harbour flying disc. The engine overperformed, breaking the sound barrier during its ascent, when it was still too low to the ground.

### New Religious Movements
