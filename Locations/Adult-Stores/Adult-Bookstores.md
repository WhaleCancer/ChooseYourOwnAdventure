# Adult Bookstores

**Type:** Retail establishments selling adult magazines, videos, and related merchandise  
**Atmosphere:** Seedy, private, with an air of shame and discretion  
**Typical Locations:** Urban areas, highway strips, industrial districts, near ports

Adult bookstores in 1985 British Columbia operate in a legal gray area, selling explicit materials that were more restricted than they would become in later decades. These establishments serve customers seeking adult entertainment while also functioning as fronts for various illegal activities. They're often located in areas with minimal foot traffic and are designed to provide privacy for customers who may be embarrassed about their purchases.

**Physical Description:**
- Storefronts with minimal or obscured windows
- Interior layouts designed for privacy, often with booths or private viewing areas
- Shelves stocked with magazines, books, and later in the decade, VHS tapes
- Private booths for viewing films or magazines (some may have additional illegal activities)
- Cash-based transactions with minimal record-keeping
- Often located in strip malls, standalone buildings, or industrial areas
- Exterior signage that may be subtle or intentionally nondescript

**Typical Clientele:**
- Men seeking adult entertainment (wide range of ages and backgrounds)
- People looking for discrete purchases
- Some locations may attract criminal elements using stores for meetings or other activities
- Tourists and travelers
- Regular customers who visit frequently

**Operations:**
- Legitimate retail businesses selling legal adult materials
- Some locations may be fronts for illegal activities: drug dealing, prostitution, illegal gambling
- Private viewing booths may be used for illegal sexual activities
- Cash-heavy businesses attractive for money laundering
- Some stores may be owned or controlled by criminal organizations
- Staff often work alone or in small numbers, making them vulnerable to robbery or other crimes

**In the Shadows:**
Adult bookstores serve multiple functions beyond their stated purpose. The private, discrete nature of these establishments makes them attractive for various illegal activities. Some locations are known meeting places for certain subcultures or criminal elements. The private booths and discrete nature mean that illegal activities can occur with minimal risk of detection. Staff may have knowledge of local happenings, criminal activity, or serve as information brokers, but the nature of the business means they're often isolated and may be unreliable sources. Some stores may have connections to organized crime, human trafficking, or other serious criminal activities.

**Game Considerations:**
- Potential sources of information, though staff may be unreliable or difficult to approach
- May be fronts for illegal activities that players can investigate
- Private viewing areas provide opportunities for discrete meetings or surveillance
- Some locations may have connections to criminal organizations
- Cash-heavy operations may be fronts for money laundering
- Useful for scenarios involving discrete purchases, meetings, or investigations
- Staff may be vulnerable to intimidation or bribery
- May have connections to sex trade or other criminal activities
- Private nature makes them useful for operations requiring discretion
