# Secret Government and Corporate Sites

**Type:** Classified locations / Research facilities  
**Location:** Various locations across British Columbia and Canada  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

Throughout British Columbia and Canada, various secret government and corporate sites conduct experiments that blur the line between science, the occult, and psychic research. These facilities often operate under plausible cover stories while conducting research that widens tears in the veil, creates "haunted" staff, or provokes increasingly invasive [[Creatures/Aliens/Greys|Grey]] and [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Elohim]] responses.

## Known Sites

### 1. RADAR/Northern Lights Array – Operation MIMIR

**Location:** Near Dawson Creek, BC  
**Cover:** Weather and aurora research station

At a decommissioned NORAD radar array near Dawson Creek, BC, the Canadian military—with covert US funding—retrofitted old Cold War towers with classified Soviet and Canadian sensors. Officially a "weather and aurora research station," the site is used after hours to broadcast coded, pulsed microwave signals at geomagnetic peaks, attempting to create anomalies in the upper atmosphere (and open a "channel" to non-human intelligences).

**Rumors/Effects:**
- Townsfolk whisper about strange static on TVs and radios that coincides with aurora displays and animal unrest.
- Some military night staff go missing or turn up weeks later in altered mental states, obsessed with geometric symbols.
- PCs might recover lab notebooks full of Gnostic sigils mixed with engineering diagrams.

### 2. The Cascade Penrose Collider

**Location:** Deep in the Cascade Mountains  
**Cover:** Civilian research collaboration studying muons and cosmic radiation

A supposedly civilian research collaboration (jointly funded by Canadian and American universities) operates a small, circular particle accelerator inside an old mining tunnel. Ostensibly, it studies muons and cosmic radiation. In reality, it runs midnight "high-impact" collisions that are deliberately "off-book," guided by ancient mathematical patterns and lunar cycles.

**Secret Purpose/Fallout:**
- Key staff are shuffled out every three months and replaced by new "clearance only" hires.
- Several local Indigenous elders testify that every experiment triggers dreams of stone doors and inhuman voices.
- PCs might find occult diagrams hidden in the control room, and witness malfunctioning electronics or poltergeist activity when the accelerator runs.
- A "locking ring" added in 1984 bears both Federal logos and engraved arcane glyphs.

### 3. The Diefenbunker Resonance Chamber (Project YAHWEH)

**Location:** Beneath the Ottawa Valley (or a BC equivalent)  
**Cover:** Testing signal hardening for secure military communications

Beneath a Diefenbunker nuclear shelter, government physicists constructed a "hyper-resonance chamber"—a metal-clad, soundproof, heavily shielded room equipped with massive transmitter coils and infrasound generators. The cover project is "testing signal hardening for secure military communications." The real purpose is to induce altered mental states (or "contact events") in carefully screened psychics and military officers using a blend of deep vibration, rotating magnetic fields, and white noise.

**Phenomena:**
- Subjects sometimes spontaneously speak in dead languages, collapse with "visions," or develop "overlapping memories."
- The walls reportedly bleed condensation during "high resonance," and at least one General claims to have "spoken with an angel of light" after spending an hour inside.
- PCs could be called for security, to "trim" a psychic gone rogue, or to investigate a staff suicide.
- Old schematics show the chamber's harmonic numbers are derived from Sumerian temple blueprints.

### 4. Mount Faith Stargate Relay

**Location:** High above Hope, BC  
**Cover:** Government telecommunications and geological survey radiometry

A relay of massive microwave towers operates day and night under the pretext of government telecommunications and "geological survey radiometry." In truth, their grid is mathematically aligned to ancient petroglyph sites below and used to broadcast encoded "star language" across thin veil junctures during meteor showers and eclipses. Parapsychologists and cryptographers, working for an unnamed ministry, monitor responses on analog recorders.

**Incidents:**
- Residents in nearby valleys report sleeplessness, recurring dreams, lost pets, and "white shapes" glimpsed crossing snowy fields at night.
- Data tapes recovered from the monitoring shack play random numbers, children's voices, and patterned interference almost no technician can explain.
- PCs may stumble upon a "test night" and be chased by security—or contacted after someone's mind breaks.

### 5. The INCO "Spirit Core" (Manitoba)

**Location:** Manitoba (with potential BC analogues)  
**Cover:** Mineral resource mapping

A pilot project buried under the guise of mineral resource mapping, the INCO nickel mining company (with unofficial government support) deployed a chain of "superconducting gravimeters" in abandoned mine shafts to "detect subtle Earth movements." The lead scientist, a Freemason fascinated by Swedenborg, used the sensors to detect "soul signatures" and orchestrated late-night resonance experiments designed to draw nonhuman attention.

**Oddments:**
- Unusual readings "never repeatable by day" fill the logs; two miners suffered "brief possessions" as described in their follow-up psych profiles.
- Ore samples in the lab glow under certain infrasound tests, sparking rumors of "ghost rock."
- PCs could be sent to retrieve data, cover up an incident, or stop rogue experiments stirring something much worse below.

### 6. The Saanich Children's Hospital "Sleep Studio"

**Location:** Vancouver Island  
**Cover:** Monitoring electrochemical sleep abnormalities in children

A hidden ward in a Vancouver Island children's hospital, funded by a shadowy Ministry of Health grant, monitors "electrochemical sleep abnormalities" in children from hot-spot towns. In reality, it's a laboratory where vulnerable children's dreams are mapped, induced, and sometimes "amplified" with psychedelic microdosing and EM fields—generating predictable contact phenomena with the Elohim.

**Incidents:**
- Some children vanish, only to come back altered or mute.
- Security patrols increase whenever geomagnetic storms are forecast.

## British Columbia's Diefenbunker Analogues

While the famous Diefenbunker (Canada's main emergency government headquarters) is in Carp, Ontario, there were several smaller regional "Diefenbunker"-style bunkers (officially called Emergency Government Headquarters, or EGHQs) across Canada, including British Columbia.

### Known/Planned Sites

1. **Kelowna EGHQ** - A large, multi-story underground emergency bunker built into the hillside at the Canadian Forces Station near Kelowna, BC. Intended as the provincial node for civil defence and government command in the event of nuclear war. After the Cold War, this facility saw other federal/infrastructure uses; much is now abandoned or discreetly repurposed.

2. **Victoria (Royal Roads)** - Rumored underground spaces at Royal Roads University grounds in Victoria (formerly a military college/naval station) that could have been upgraded for use as an EGHQ or intelligence annex.

3. **Vancouver (Regional)** - Some sources claim a regional EGHQ or "Diefenbunker" was built beneath (or near) the old Jericho Beach military facility or North Vancouver's Burrard Dry Dock property—although this may have been a smaller signals/radio bunker rather than a full command post.

4. **Prince George "BC North" Bunker** - As a population and infrastructure hub for the north, Prince George's city archives and retired federal workers sometimes reference a bombproof "basement" in the city's old government precinct, allegedly built during the late '50s/early '60s.

5. **Kamloops Interior Hub** - Kamloops has always been a regional transport and military node; there is some circumstantial evidence of a reinforced comms "centre" (or at least a stand-alone fallout shelter) in a warehouse or rail yard.

### Possible "Lost" or Legendary Bunkers

- **Mountain Bunkers:** Popular legend claims there are "lost" Cold War bunkers in the Cariboo Mountains, Okanagan Highland, and Vancouver Island fjords—caves and tunnels hastily modernized with concrete, mysterious radio towers, and forgotten by all but the oldest civil defence staff.
- **Hydroelectric Dam Control Bunkers:** Some of BC's major dams (ex: Revelstoke, WAC Bennett) have hardened control rooms or "refuge chambers" built to withstand major attacks.
- **Remote Airfield EGHQs:** WWII and Cold War airstrips (like Fort Nelson or Smithers) sometimes had their own miniature bunkers for command crews and radio relays.

## General Notes

- At all these sites, **hidden intersections of science, the occult, and psychic research create plausible deniability**—but widen tears in the veil, create "haunted" staff, or provoke increasingly invasive Greys/Elohim response.
- **PCs might be brought in as investigators, security, cleanup crews, or unwilling test subjects.**

## In Play

These secret sites serve as:

- **Investigation locations** - Where strange phenomena require M-EPIC attention
- **Cover-up operations** - Sites that need to be protected from public knowledge
- **Faction battlegrounds** - Multiple groups may be interested in the research being conducted
- **Adventure locations** - Where the weird science meets the supernatural

### Adventure Hooks

- Investigating a forgotten Kelowna bunker operational again for a secret "resonance" experiment.
- On Vancouver Island, uncovering a "sealed ward" in a re-purposed Royal Roads tunnel where Cold War physicists once summoned/captured Elohim energy by accident.
- In Prince George, a sealed "vault basement" yields magnetic tapes, secret relics (Elohim artifacts, ORION backup nodes), and evidence of a 1960s-era mass abduction coverup.
- Local policing gets called to "break up" squatters at a supposed abandoned Jericho Beach bunker—only to find odd lights and vanished security guards.
