Pool halls in 1985 British Columbia serve as social gathering places where people come to play billiards, socialize, and sometimes gamble.

**In the Shadows:**
Pool halls serve as information hubs where people from various backgrounds gather. The casual, social atmosphere makes them ideal for discrete meetings and business transactions. Illegal gambling is common in some locations, with high-stakes games attracting serious players and criminal elements. The regular clientele and staff often have knowledge of local happenings, criminal activity, and community gossip. Some halls have developed reputations within criminal circles as neutral ground for meetings or as locations where certain types of business can be conducted. The cash-based nature and late hours make these establishments attractive for money laundering or other financial crimes.
