# Hotel Lounges and Cocktail Bars

**Type:** Hotel lounges, airport bars, and business-district cocktail rooms  
**Atmosphere:** Quiet, polished, with an emphasis on discretion and convenience  
**Typical Locations:** Downtown hotels, business districts, near convention centers, airport and highway hotels

Hotel lounges in 1985 British Columbia cater to business travelers, flight crews, tourists, and locals looking for a more discreet drink. These spaces feel detached from the neighborhoods around them—halfway between public and private, where people assume no one is paying close attention. That illusion of anonymity makes them ideal for off-the-books meetings, quick affairs, and subtle criminal arrangements that never touch the street.

**Physical Description:**
- Carpeted floors, soft lighting, and muted color schemes that blend into the background
- Polished bar with a wide selection of mid-range and premium liquor
- Padded chairs and low tables optimized for quiet conversation rather than volume drinking
- Background jazz, soft rock, or piano music that covers voices without being intrusive
- Large windows overlooking lobbies, parking lots, or city skylines
- Direct access to hotel elevators or corridors, allowing quick exits to rooms or parking

**Typical Clientele:**
- Business travelers entertaining clients or drinking alone between meetings
- Flight crews, tour guides, and other transient workers on layovers
- Tourists staying at the hotel, especially older couples or families after hours
- Local professionals who prefer anonymous drinks away from their own neighborhoods
- Escorts, discreet companions, and the fixers who arrange meetings
- Criminal intermediaries, lawyers, and “respectable” front-men who avoid rougher venues

**Operations:**
- Legitimate businesses closely tied to hotel management and corporate policies
- Charge higher prices for drinks and food, trading on convenience and perceived safety
- Staff trained to be polite, discreet, and to remember faces without asking questions
- Some lounges cultivate relationships with escort services, high-end dealers, or corporate fixers
- Cash-heavy transactions from travelers who prefer not to leave paper trails
- Hotel security monitors the space but focuses on overt trouble, not quiet conversations

**In the Shadows:**
Hotel lounges function as diplomatic ground between the street and the boardroom. Deals that would look suspicious in a dive bar or strip club pass here as "business meetings." Corporate espionage, political back-channeling, and organized crime negotiations all find a comfortable home in the soft chairs and muted lighting. Because many guests move in and out daily, it's easy to stage hand-offs, exchange documents, or host one-time meetings between people who never officially set foot in the country. International strange phenomena also filter through these spaces: foreign dignitaries with unusual security needs, scientists on quietly funded trips, or travelers shaken by something they saw in a remote town all pass through the bar on their way to or from somewhere else.

**Game Considerations:**
- **Neutral negotiation ground:** Ideal for high-stakes meetings where everyone wants to avoid visible violence and public scandal.
- **Transient intel:** PCs can overhear or intercept information from travelers about distant locations, border issues, or unexplained incidents.
- **Access to rooms and records:** The lounge is a gateway to guest rooms, conference spaces, and hotel back offices full of useful information.
- **Cover for cross-faction dealings:** Factions who would never meet on each other's turf can plausibly meet here under the guise of legitimate business.
- **Subtle security challenges:** Hotel cameras, keycard systems, and security staff complicate overt action while still being 1980s-primitive enough to subvert.
- **Weirdness in transit:** Strange cargo, unusual guests, and unexplained emergencies can all intersect in the lounge before heading deeper into or out of the city.
