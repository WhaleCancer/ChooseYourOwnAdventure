# Neighborhood Pubs

**Type:** Community-oriented bars and taverns  
**Atmosphere:** Familiar, social, can swing from relaxed to volatile depending on the night  
**Typical Locations:** Residential neighborhoods, small-town main streets, strip malls, near transit hubs

Neighborhood pubs in 1985 British Columbia blend social club, family dining spot, and after-work watering hole. Regulars know the staff and each other by name, and outsiders stand out immediately. On most nights these places feel safe and predictable; on others, simmering grudges, unpaid tabs, and local tensions can boil over into fights or worse.

**Physical Description:**
- Wood-paneled walls, framed local memorabilia, and faded beer posters
- Long central bar with a few well-worn bartenders who have "always" worked there
- Mix of booths, tables, and a small stage or corner for live music or karaoke
- One or two televisions tuned to hockey or local news rather than full-on sports coverage
- Chalkboards advertising daily specials, meat draws, or charity events
- Located on corners or in low-rise commercial strips, often with a liquor store nearby

**Typical Clientele:**
- Local residents: tradespeople, office workers, small business owners
- Older regulars who have claimed the same seats for years
- Local minor criminals, bookies, and small-time dealers blending in with the crowd
- Families during early hours, before the bar shifts to adults-only at night
- Off-duty cops, firefighters, or civil servants who live in the neighborhood
- Occasional outsiders who stand out and draw attention from regulars

**Operations:**
- Mostly legitimate businesses with steady regular income
- May host informal betting pools, cribbage leagues, or darts tournaments with under-the-table wagers
- Some pubs quietly tolerate low-level dealing or bookmaking by favored regulars
- Owners often have deep ties to the neighborhood, unions, or local business associations
- Staff know who drinks too much, who pays in cash only, and who quietly settles other people’s tabs
- Certain nights (payday, big games, anniversaries) reliably draw larger, rowdier crowds

**In the Shadows:**
Neighborhood pubs sit at the intersection of gossip, local politics, and low-level crime. They are where off-duty cops drink across the room from small-time crooks, both pretending not to notice. Rumors about strange phenomena, new criminal players, or unusual activity filter through these bars first, often half-remembered or exaggerated. Because many regulars work in trades, transport, or local government, the pub can become an accidental clearinghouse for information about infrastructure projects, port schedules, or odd incidents that never make the news. Some pubs are quietly claimed as "unofficial territory" by a gang, union crew, or low-level organized crime figure, but open violence is rare; everyone understands that spilling blood here makes life worse for the entire neighborhood.

**Game Considerations:**
- **Local intel hubs:** Excellent places to learn about neighborhood issues, missing persons, strange sightings, and low-level crime.
- **Social pressure zones:** PCs can gain or lose reputation based on how they treat staff and regulars over multiple visits.
- **Mixed loyalties:** Staff and regulars may be torn between helping PCs, protecting neighbors, and staying on the good side of local toughs or off-duty cops.
- **Soft introductions to bigger threats:** Rumors about major factions, smuggling routes, or strange phenomena often surface here first in diluted form.
- **Safe but not safe:** Compared to dive bars or biker bars, violence is less likely, but when it happens it has serious social consequences in the community.
- **Slow-burn relationships:** Returning here repeatedly lets PCs cultivate long-term contacts, favors, and obligations that can matter later in the campaign.
