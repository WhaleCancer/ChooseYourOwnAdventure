# Live Music Clubs and Rock Venues

**Type:** Bars built around live bands, rock shows, and alternative music scenes  
**Atmosphere:** Loud, crowded, energetic, with an undercurrent of chaos  
**Typical Locations:** Downtown entertainment districts, near universities, in converted warehouses or theaters

Live music clubs in 1985 British Columbia are where youth culture, subcultures, and the music industry collide. Punk, metal, new wave, and bar-band rock all share small stages and blown-out speakers. These venues draw a mix of die-hard fans, scene kids, musicians, industry hopefuls, and the people who quietly make money off all of them.

**Physical Description:**
- Dark rooms with low stages, minimal seating, and sticky floors
- Basic sound systems, battered amps, and tangled cables running everywhere
- Band posters, graffiti, and handbills layered on every available surface
- Bars tucked along one wall, serving cheap draft and a few hard-liquor staples
- Backstage areas that are little more than storage rooms with a couch and a mirror
- Converted warehouses, basements, or old theaters repurposed with minimal renovation

**Typical Clientele:**
- Local bands, road acts, and their friends and hangers-on
- Young fans, art students, and subculture kids (punks, metalheads, goths, etc.)
- Small-time dealers working the crowd during and after shows
- Club owners, promoters, and would-be managers looking for talent or leverage
- Off-duty bartenders, artists, and service workers from other parts of the city
- Occasional older patrons with money whose reasons for being there are not obvious

**Operations:**
- Revenue from cover charges, drink sales, and occasional special events
- Pay-to-play or exploitative booking arrangements that keep bands hungry and desperate
- Strong informal networks between clubs, promoters, and bands share information and favors
- Some venues double as distribution points for drugs popular with the music scene
- Bouncers and security used as much to protect the business as to keep the peace
- Sound techs and staff privy to backstage conversations, arguments, and whispered deals

**In the Shadows:**
Live music clubs are pressure valves for the city—places where people scream, dance, and burn off frustration in the dark. The volume and chaos make them ideal for quick hand-offs, secret meetings in green rooms, or slipping strange items onto or off of trucks and vans. Subcultures drawn to the unusual and transgressive are often the first to notice when something is wrong: a band that plays sets that induce disturbing visions, a recurring blackout that seems to follow a particular act, a patron who never appears on film despite being in a hundred flyers' worth of photos. Organized crime sees these clubs as useful but volatile fronts, while certain fringe academics, occultists, or government watchers track the scene for patterns that don't make sense.

**Game Considerations:**
- **Noise as cover:** The volume and constant motion make surveillance difficult but provide excellent cover for PCs moving, fighting, or casting in the crowd.
- **Scene-based contacts:** Musicians, promoters, and regulars can become information sources or allies with access to youth culture and underground networks.
- **Strange performances:** Gigs can become set pieces where music, lighting, and weird phenomena interact in dangerous or revealing ways.
- **Criminal-business overlap:** Venues provide opportunities for laundering money, distributing drugs, or recruiting muscle under the guise of band security.
- **Identity and disguise:** PCs can infiltrate as roadies, bands, or staff, using the transient nature of touring acts as cover.
- **Recurring location:** A favorite club can evolve across the campaign—changing owners, scenes, and supernatural reputation as events unfold.
