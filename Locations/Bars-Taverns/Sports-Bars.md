# Sports Bars

**Type:** Bars focused on televised sports and social drinking  
**Atmosphere:** Loud, crowded during games, more subdued otherwise  
**Typical Locations:** Urban areas, suburban strips, near arenas and stadiums

Sports bars became increasingly popular in the 1980s as cable television expanded and more sports programming became available. In 1985 British Columbia, these establishments cater to sports fans while also serving as social gathering places. They're generally safer and more mainstream than dive bars, but they still attract a mix of clientele and can serve as fronts for various activities.

**Physical Description:**
- Multiple television sets tuned to different games or sports channels
- Large, open spaces with tables and bar seating
- Sports memorabilia, team jerseys, and championship banners on walls
- Often feature pool tables, video games, and sometimes arcade machines
- Brighter lighting than dive bars, more family-friendly atmosphere
- Located in commercial areas, often with parking lots

**Typical Clientele:**
- Sports fans gathering to watch games
- Office workers after hours
- Mixed crowd of all ages during popular games
- Some criminal elements using the crowded, noisy environment for meetings
- Tourists and visitors looking for familiar entertainment

**Operations:**
- Legitimate businesses with proper licensing and record-keeping
- May host betting pools or illegal sports gambling operations
- Some locations may be fronts for money laundering or other criminal activities
- Staff often knowledgeable about local sports teams and events
- Can become extremely crowded during major games or events

**In the Shadows:**
While sports bars are generally legitimate businesses, their crowded, noisy environments make them useful for discrete meetings. The focus on televised events means people can have conversations without drawing attention. Some bars may be connected to illegal gambling operations, and the constant flow of people provides cover for various activities. During major events, the sheer volume of people can make it easy to blend in or conduct business unnoticed.

**Game Considerations:**
- Good locations for discrete meetings in crowded environments
- Potential connections to illegal gambling or sports betting operations
- Information sources about local events and community happenings
- Generally safe locations for player characters to gather information
- May be fronts for criminal activities that require investigation
- Useful for blending in with crowds during operations
- Staff may have knowledge of local events or people of interest
