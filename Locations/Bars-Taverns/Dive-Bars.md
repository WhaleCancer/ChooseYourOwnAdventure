Dive bars are the backbone of British Columbia's drinking culture, especially in working-class and industrial areas. In 1985, these establishments serve as community gathering places, neutral ground for various social groups, and sometimes fronts for criminal activity. They range from relatively safe neighborhood taverns to dangerous establishments where violence is common and the clientele includes criminals, bikers, and those operating on the fringes of society.

**Physical Description:**
- Dim lighting, often with neon beer signs and outdated decor
- Sticky floors, worn furniture, and the smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke
- Jukeboxes playing classic rock, country, or whatever the regulars prefer
- Pool tables, dartboards, and sometimes video games
- Bars that have seen decades of use, with character and wear
- Often located in strip malls, standalone buildings, or attached to motels

**Typical Clientele:**
- Working-class locals, factory workers, truck drivers
- Biker gang members and associates
- Criminals using the bar as a meeting place or neutral ground
- Regulars who treat the bar as a second home
- Occasional tourists or travelers who don't know better
- People looking to avoid attention or conduct business away from prying eyes

**Operations:**
- Cash-heavy businesses, often with minimal record-keeping
- May serve as fronts for illegal activities: drug dealing, fencing stolen goods, illegal gambling
- Some bars are owned or controlled by criminal organizations
- Bartenders often serve as information brokers, knowing everyone's business
- Regulars develop relationships with staff and other patrons over years

**In the Shadows:**
Dive bars serve as information hubs where rumors, gossip, and useful intelligence flow freely. Bartenders and regulars often know about local happenings, criminal activity, and strange occurrences. Some bars have developed reputations for being safe havens where certain topics can be discussed, or where people can meet without drawing attention. In remote areas, dive bars may be the only social gathering place for miles, making them central to local knowledge and gossip about unexplained phenomena.

**Game Considerations:**
- Information gathering locations where players can learn about local happenings

- Potential sources of rumors about strange events or unexplained phenomena
- May be fronts for illegal activities that players can investigate or exploit
- Neutral ground where different groups can interact without violence
- Bartenders can serve as valuable contacts with knowledge of the local area
- Some bars may have connections to criminal organizations or serve as operational bases
- Regulars may have witnessed or know about strange events in the area
