# Biker Bars and Roadhouse Taverns

**Type:** Outlaw biker hangouts and highway roadhouse bars  
**Atmosphere:** Loud, territorial, and intimidating to outsiders  
**Typical Locations:** Highway junctions, industrial fringes, outskirts of small towns, near biker clubhouses

Biker bars in 1985 British Columbia are the unofficial living rooms of outlaw motorcycle clubs and their hangers-on. These spots sit just far enough from polite society that noise, fights, and late-night parties draw minimal police attention. For patched members, the bar is home turf; for everyone else, it's a place you enter with caution, or not at all.

**Physical Description:**
- Low, broad buildings with big parking lots full of motorcycles and a few battered trucks
- Loud rock or metal blasting from jukeboxes or small live setups
- Heavy wooden furniture, scarred tables, and bar tops stained by years of spills and burns
- Club colors, banners, and photographs decorating the walls alongside biker and pin-up posters
- Minimal or no windows facing the road, often with heavy blinds or bars
- Back rooms, fenced yards, or attached garages for private meetings and bike work

**Typical Clientele:**
- Outlaw biker gang members and prospects
- Associates, hang-arounds, and girlfriends tied to the club
- Independent truckers, loggers, and roughneck workers who are tolerated or protected
- Local toughs hoping to impress or be noticed by the club
- Occasional brave or foolish outsiders who usually don't stay long
- Drug dealers, gun runners, and smugglers with business ties to the club

**Operations:**
- Function as informal clubhouses or secondary bases for biker gangs
- Cash-heavy bars with minimal bookkeeping and lots of off-the-books tabs
- Hubs for drug distribution, weapons deals, and enforcement work in nearby territories
- Staff often directly connected to the club by blood, romance, or long-term loyalty
- Parking lots and back rooms used for meetings, intimidation, or quick beatings
- Club leadership quietly monitors who comes and goes, and who talks to whom

**In the Shadows:**
Biker bars are territorial markers as much as businesses; their existence signals who controls the surrounding roads and small towns. These establishments sit astride key transportation routes, making them natural waypoints for smuggling operations, cross-border deals, and moving "weird cargo" picked up in remote areas. The same bikers who run cocaine and guns also pass through stretches of wilderness where strange phenomena are more common, returning with stories they share only after several drinks. Rivals know that targeting the bar is the fastest way to provoke open war, which makes it both dangerous and surprisingly stable—until something happens that someone can't ignore.

**Game Considerations:**
- **Gateway to biker factions:** Natural entry point for dealing with biker gangs, earning (or losing) their trust, and taking on jobs tied to their interests.
- **Controlled tension:** Any action here risks immediate, violent response from multiple armed patrons; even conversations are high-stakes.
- **Choke point on routes:** Bars located on key highways or logging roads can control who moves contraband, people, or information.
- **Weirdness on the road:** Bikers and truckers swapping stories here may be among the first to describe strange incidents in remote stretches of highway or forest.
- **Power signals:** Who is allowed in, who sits where, and whose bike gets the best parking all signal current internal politics and alliances.
- **Potential war zones:** An attack, insult, or failed negotiation here can trigger broader conflict across multiple towns and factions.
