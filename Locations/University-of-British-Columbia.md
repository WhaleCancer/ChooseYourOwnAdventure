# University of British Columbia (UBC)

**Type:** University / Research institution  
**Location:** Vancouver, British Columbia  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

**The University of British Columbia (UBC)** is home to leading programs in environmental science, forestry, engineering, psychology… and a small but surprisingly well-funded **anomalous phenomena research group** buried within the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences. Officially, they work on geomagnetic anomalies, environmental signals, and indigenous traditions of the Pacific Northwest. Unofficially, they're the go-to academic consultants for government departments and corporations (like [ORION](./Factions/Corporations/Orion-International.md)) whenever the data shows "unexplainables."

## What They Know

- **UBC's researchers run several "anomaly" projects as corporate or government contracts**, doing everything from satellite data analysis (with limited access to ORION's feed) to "psycho-social impact" studies on communities affected by High Strangeness.
- **Several faculty** (e.g., Dr. Erik Hauser, geophysicist; Prof. Lily Karloff, folklore/psychology) are convinced that geomagnetic surges correlate with UFO sightings and ecological trauma: they're quietly working on a "Vancouver Anomaly Map" overlapping missing persons, indigenous sacred sites, and cold-war radar outposts.
- **A deep, confidential archive** holds manuscripts, field notes, and oral histories on "star people," thunderbird sightings, and disappearances—all cross-referenced with recent satellite anomalies and unsolved deaths.

## Why They're Interested

- **Funding and Reputation:** They get real money from both Orion International and the federal government for their work—even if it's not always clear what their "deliverables" are meant for.
- **Intellectual Curiosity:** Some at UBC are true believers with academic rigor; others think it's all a hoax, but the work is fascinating, the money real.
- **Dark Hunches:** At least one or two faculty realize something is "really wrong"—experiment logs showing magnetometers going haywire, brain scans from abduction victims with "statistically-impossible" EEG patterns, etc.

## Their Secrets & Weaknesses

- **Ego and Rivalries:** Professors often refuse to share findings with each other or with "para-academic cranks." Some data is deliberately buried if it's too weird for publication.
- **A Leaky Ship:** Graduate students gossip, sometimes dropping hints to the press or unwittingly sharing critical data at conferences or with cultists posing as "contactees."
- **Corporate Ties:** ORION sometimes "sanitizes" the data UBC receives. UBC scientists sometimes realize they're being played, but a few enjoy the perks and look away.

## Connections with the Elohim/Greys Conspiracy

- **Some researchers have experienced missing time or blackouts after fieldwork at "hot spots"**—and a few come back subtly changed.
- **A once-respected professor has secretly joined (or founded) a cult** akin to [The Star Communion](./Factions/Cults/Star-Communion.md), using her academic credentials to lend legitimacy.
- **Occasional odd requests come in via the government** for "experts" on ancient languages, meta-materials, or unconscious "mass dream phenomena."
- **A hidden sub-basement or lost storage room on campus** contains confiscated artifacts and deviant biological samples—often with security that's much too tight for academic property.

## Hooks for PCs

- **A grad student contacts agents:** "My advisor's been acting weird since we went out to Pine Lake—his journals are full of numbers, and now men from ORION are asking about our project."
- **Campus rumor mill:** Strange lights seen on the clock tower roof, missing memory among staff, mysterious satellite dishes on departmental rooftops.
- **UBC invites the agents to a closed academic symposium** on Northwest anomalies—just as a key speaker vanishes mid-presentation.

## In Summary

UBC is the *intellectual crossroads*: they're facilitators, sometimes dupe and sometimes ally, preyed upon by both ORION and the Elohim because of their curiosity and access. Their faculty may hold key pieces, or dangerous misunderstandings, and their campus is a potential hotbed of both discovery and disaster.
