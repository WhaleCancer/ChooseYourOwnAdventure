# Seedy Urban and Roadside Locations

**Type:** Illicit, borderline-legal, and predatory establishments  
**Atmosphere:** Exploitative, secretive, and transactional  
**Typical Regions:** Vancouver and Fraser Valley urban cores, highway strips, port districts, mill towns, border communities

These locations represent the sleazier side of 1985 British Columbia—places where vice, desperation, and organized crime intersect. Many operate in legal gray areas or as fronts for outright criminal activity. They’re designed to give you quick, ready-to-use backdrops for investigations, deals, and strange phenomena that thrive in the cracks of the urban landscape.

## Massage Parlors

**Type:** Body-rub parlors and “health” studios fronting for sex work  
**Atmosphere:** Dim, perfumed, and carefully anonymous  
**Typical Locations:** Commercial strips, above-ground-level units, near motels and transit hubs

Massage parlors operate under vague licensing and ambiguous advertising (“relaxation,” “body care”). Doors lock behind clients, front desks use first names only, and the line between legitimate massage and sex work depends on who owns the place and which cops are on the take.

## Illegal Brothels and Rooming Houses

**Type:** Unlicensed brothels run from houses, apartments, or subdivided floors  
**Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic, tired, and tense beneath a thin veil of hospitality  
**Typical Locations:** Aging walk-ups, run-down houses, side streets near downtown cores or industrial zones

These locations look like ordinary residences from the street but operate on a constant cycle of anonymous visitors. Locks are heavy, windows are often covered, and neighbors know more than they admit—some rely on the income, others live in constant fear of raids and reprisals.

---

## Peep-Show Arcades

**Type:** Coin-operated peep booths and adult video “arcades”  
**Atmosphere:** Dark, mechanical, and isolating  
**Typical Locations:** Downtown red-light strips, near adult bookstores or porn cinemas

Rows of private booths line narrow corridors, each with a slot for coins and worn viewing windows. Staff clean when they must and look the other way the rest of the time, while dealers, blackmailers, and voyeurs work the gaps between machines and the back hallways.

---

## Adult Movie Theatres

**Type:** Porn cinemas and “art houses” that never show real art films  
**Atmosphere:** Stale, dim, and heavy with smoke and old carpet  
**Typical Locations:** Fading downtown entertainment districts, near bus stations or industrial edges

Single-screen theatres survive on adult features, selling cheap tickets and overpriced concessions. The darkness hides who sits next to whom, and the back rows are more about transactions and surveillance than the film on the screen.

---

## Escort Agencies

**Type:** Office-front operations arranging paid companionship and sex work  
**Atmosphere:** Thinly professional, with a telemarketing edge  
**Typical Locations:** Anonymous office suites, converted houses, upstairs units above retail

Escort agencies maintain phones, ledgers, and a few desks to look legitimate while dispatching workers to hotels, motels, and private residences. Call logs, address books, and booking cards become explosive evidence tying together clients, officials, and organized crime if they fall into the wrong hands.

---

## Hostess Bars and Cabaret Lounges

**Type:** Bars where patrons pay for company more than drinks  
**Atmosphere:** Smoky, flirtatious, and carefully choreographed  
**Typical Locations:** Downtown nightlife districts, near business cores and high-end hotels

Hostesses are paid to keep customers drinking, talking, and spending—not necessarily to go home with them. Behind the scenes, managers balance liquor sales, side deals, and quiet arrangements with powerful regulars, while some clubs drift into outright sex work and blackmail.

---

## After-Hours Clubs

**Type:** Unlicensed late-night bars and dance rooms  
**Atmosphere:** Sweaty, loud, and increasingly unpredictable toward dawn  
**Typical Locations:** Warehouses, basements, backrooms of closed businesses, industrial fringes

After legal closing time, certain doors open to those who know the knock. Inside, alcohol flows without permits, drugs move freely, and music pounds until sunrise. Fire exits are questionable, and security cares more about keeping out cops than getting anyone safely out in an emergency.

---

## Underground Gambling Dens

**Type:** Hidden casinos and illegal betting rooms  
**Atmosphere:** Tense, smoky, and watched from every angle  
**Typical Locations:** Basements, backrooms, private clubs, above-closed storefronts

These spaces host poker, mahjong, roulette knock-offs, sports betting, and dice games. House rules are enforced by quiet, hard-eyed men, and regulars know that owing the wrong person money here can ruin more than just a credit score.

---

## Back-Room Card Rooms

**Type:** Informal gambling spaces attached to legitimate businesses  
**Atmosphere:** Claimed as “just friendly games” but run like house operations  
**Typical Locations:** Back of restaurants, bars, pool halls, cultural associations

Front businesses give cover for a few tables that run late into the night. Owners skim the pot, local fixers keep an eye on new faces, and cops who stop by for food pretend not to notice the regulars slipping through the unmarked door.

---

## Pawn Shops

**Type:** Second-hand dealers doubling as fences and loan fronts  
**Atmosphere:** Cluttered, watchful, and transactional to the point of cruelty  
**Typical Locations:** Struggling commercial strips, near bus depots, in rough neighborhoods

Items move through glass cases and storage rooms with minimal questions asked: stolen tools, electronics, jewelry, firearms, and occasionally things that make even hardened owners uneasy. Paperwork is as thorough or as fake as needed, depending on who’s buying and who’s asking.

---

## Loan-Shark Offices

**Type:** Unlicensed moneylenders and “finance” storefronts  
**Atmosphere:** Thinly polite over a bedrock of threat  
**Typical Locations:** Upstairs offices, strip malls, backrooms of ethnic businesses or social clubs

Contracts are simple: fast cash now, impossible terms later. Security glass and locked doors protect staff, while collectors handle missed payments through intimidation, property damage, or worse. Ledger books and debtor lists are weapons that can be sold, stolen, or used to control entire blocks.

---

## Shooting Galleries and Drug Dens

**Type:** Houses, apartments, or basements dedicated to using hard drugs  
**Atmosphere:** Numb, grim, and collapsing at the edges  
**Typical Locations:** Inner-city blocks, decaying rooming houses, industrial fringes

Mattresses, burned spoons, and stained walls mark these spaces as places where people come to disappear into the needle or pipe. Dealers, enforcers, and desperate users cycle through, while landlords or slumlords pretend not to know as long as some rent appears.

---

## Back-Alley Clinics

**Type:** Unlicensed medical and patch-up services  
**Atmosphere:** Sterile where it counts, filthy everywhere else  
**Typical Locations:** Basements below legitimate clinics, above pharmacies, in converted apartments or offices

These clinics treat gunshot wounds, overdoses, botched abortions, and injuries no official doctor will touch without paperwork. Payment is cash, favors, or leverage, and records—if kept at all—are stored in locked cabinets that could topple careers and factions alike.

---

## Flophouses and SRO Hotels

**Type:** Single-room-occupancy hotels and transient lodgings  
**Atmosphere:** Depressed, crowded, and worn down to the studs  
**Typical Locations:** Downtown cores, near ports, in old commercial districts

Tiny rooms with shared bathrooms house long-term poor residents, seasonal workers, sex workers, and the recently released from jail or psychiatric care. Managers juggle rent, complaints, and quiet threats, while hallways echo with arguments, whispered deals, and things moving in the walls.

---

## Run-Down Boarding Houses

**Type:** Informal rooming houses carved out of old homes  
**Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic, suspicious, and barely maintained  
**Typical Locations:** Once-respectable residential streets now sliding into decline

Landlords subdivide aging houses into tiny rooms, renting by the week in cash. Tenants range from students and new immigrants to fugitives and small-time criminals. Everyone hears everyone else’s business through thin walls, making secrets hard to keep and rumors hard to kill.

---

## Porn Production Studios

**Type:** Low-budget adult film and photo studios  
**Atmosphere:** Shabby glamour over industrial grime  
**Typical Locations:** Converted warehouses, lofts, or office units near industrial or entertainment districts

Makeshift sets, cheap lighting rigs, and stained backdrops share space with filing cabinets full of release forms, tapes, and photographs that could ruin lives. Producers juggle permits, censorship boards, organized crime investors, and performers with nowhere else to go.

---

## Modeling and “Talent” Agencies

**Type:** Fronts for exploitation and grooming under a veneer of opportunity  
**Atmosphere:** Slick at first glance, predatory underneath  
**Typical Locations:** Office towers, converted houses, upstairs units in shopping strips

These agencies promise portfolios, auditions, and introductions in exchange for fees, photos, and obedience. Some funnel hopefuls into legitimate work; others quietly steer them toward porn, escorting, or worse. Filing cabinets and photo archives double as blackmail vaults.

---

## Private Sex Clubs and Swingers’ Houses

**Type:** Membership-only parties and sex-focused social clubs  
**Atmosphere:** Polite, coded, and thick with hidden hierarchies  
**Typical Locations:** Large private homes, rented halls, converted warehouse lofts

Events are invite-only, with screening done through personal networks, classified ads, or coded newsletters. While many participants are ordinary people chasing thrill and discretion, organizers may also be probing for leverage, recruiting for cults, or testing boundaries for something not entirely human.

---

## Sauna and Bathhouse Fronts

**Type:** Bathhouses and saunas with unofficial sexual services  
**Atmosphere:** Steamy, muffled, and layered with overlapping subcultures  
**Typical Locations:** Older urban baths, basement facilities, converted health clubs

Some operate as legitimate cultural or gay community spaces; others quietly add “extras” off the books. Staff and regulars can be valuable sources of information about hidden communities, missing people, disease outbreaks, or things that followed someone in from the night.

---

## Truck-Stop Services and Shower Blocks

**Type:** Shower facilities, lounges, and “services” at highway truck stops  
**Atmosphere:** Fluorescent, exhausted, and barely supervised after midnight  
**Typical Locations:** Major highway intersections, near border crossings, outside mill and port towns

Showers, laundry rooms, TV lounges, and back-lot parking form a transient village for long-haul drivers, sex workers, smugglers, and drifters. Deals, hand-offs, and quiet disappearances happen in the dimly lit spaces between fuel pumps, diner doors, and the rows of idling rigs.
