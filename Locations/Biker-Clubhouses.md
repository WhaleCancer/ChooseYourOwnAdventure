# Biker Clubhouses

**Type:** Outlaw motorcycle gang bases and social compounds  
**Atmosphere:** Insular, territorial, and heavily controlled by club culture  
**Typical Locations:** Industrial fringes, rural properties, edge-of-town warehouses, converted farmsteads

Biker clubhouses in 1985 British Columbia are the nerve centers of outlaw motorcycle gangs. More than simple bars or hangouts, they blend fortified safehouse, party venue, workshop, and headquarters into one location. The clubhouse is where business is decided, discipline is enforced, and outsiders are reminded—subtly or brutally—whose name is on the patch.

**Physical Description:**
- Standalone buildings or compounds with clear visual claims: club colors, flags, painted logos, or modified signs
- High fences, chained gates, security cameras (for the era), and reinforced doors and windows
- Large garages or workshops for bike maintenance, modification, and occasional vehicle work
- Interior walls covered in club photos, trophies, memorials, and symbols marking rank and history
- Party spaces with bars, stages, and open floors, often more chaotic than commercial biker bars
- Back offices and locked rooms for storing weapons, cash, records, and sensitive contraband

**Typical Occupants:**
- Patched members, officers, and prospects of the outlaw club
- Old ladies (long-term partners), girlfriends, and hang-arounds tied socially to the club
- Trusted mechanics, gun runners, or specialists allowed limited access
- Occasional emissaries from other criminal groups arriving strictly by invitation
- Very few true outsiders; those who enter uninvited are noticed immediately

**Operations:**
- Acts as command center for club activities: territory defense, protection rackets, drug distribution, and enforcement
- Used to store weapons, vehicles, drugs, and other contraband away from public view
- Hosts closed-door meetings with other factions when neutral ground is not desired
- Functions as a screening point for new associates, business partners, and informants
- Maintains both visible security (guards on doors, lookouts) and quiet measures (checkpoints, neighborhood watchers)
- Frequently lies at the center of informal networks with local bars, garages, and tow companies

**In the Shadows:**
Biker clubhouses sit at the intersection of organized crime, rural isolation, and the unknown. Many are located near logging roads, old quarries, or stretches of highway where strange phenomena are more likely to occur—and where law enforcement is thin. Club members running night rides, guarding grow-ops, or exploring old service roads bring back stories the outside world never hears. Some clubhouses quietly store "weird cargo" recovered from remote sites: unmarked containers found dumped off logging roads, strange equipment abandoned near transmission towers, or trophies taken from things that shouldn’t exist. Superstitions, private rituals, and club legends grow around these experiences, shaping which backroads are used, which are avoided, and what debts the club believes it is owed by whatever shares the night with them.

**Game Considerations:**
- **High-risk location:** Infiltrating or attacking a clubhouse is extremely dangerous; it is filled with armed, organized combatants who know the terrain.
- **Faction heart:** Actions here directly affect the biker gang’s morale, leadership, and capacity to operate across the region.
- **Information choke point:** Officers and trusted members know about smuggling routes, drug networks, local law enforcement habits, and strange happenings in remote areas.
- **Social tests:** PCs must navigate respect, hierarchy, and protocol—who they talk to, how they stand, and what they wear all matter.
- **Weird caches:** The clubhouse may hold unique evidence of supernatural or unexplained events that no one else has seen—or believes.
- **Escalation trigger:** Violence or betrayal tied to a clubhouse can rapidly escalate to multi-city biker wars or reprisals against allies and bystanders.
