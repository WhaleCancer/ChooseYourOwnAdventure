## Overview

Victoria is the capital city of the Canadian province of British Columbia, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island off Canada's Pacific coast. The city has a population of 64,379, and the Greater Victoria area has a population of 231,237.

Named for Queen Victoria, the city is one of the oldest in the Pacific Northwest, with British settlement beginning in 1843. The city has retained a large number of its historic buildings, in particular its two most famous landmarks, the Parliament Buildings (finished in 1897 and home of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia) and the Empress Hotel (opened in 1908). The city's Chinatown is the second oldest in North America, after San Francisco.

## History

Prior to the arrival of European navigators in the late 1700s, the Greater Victoria area was home to several communities of Coast Salish peoples, including the Lekwungen and Saanich peoples.

## Key Areas

### Parliament Buildings

The seat of British Columbia's provincial government, completed in 1897. The buildings serve as both a political center and a tourist attraction, with their distinctive architecture and waterfront location.

### Empress Hotel

Historic luxury hotel opened in 1908, serving as a symbol of Victoria's British colonial heritage and a destination for tourists and dignitaries.

### Chinatown

The second oldest Chinatown in North America, after San Francisco. This historic district serves as a center for Chinese Canadian culture and may have connections to organized crime networks.

### Inner Harbour

The central waterfront area, featuring the Parliament Buildings, Empress Hotel, and various tourist attractions. The harbour serves as a focal point for both tourism and potential paranormal activity.

- **Government center** - M-EPIC and other agencies may have offices or operations in Victoria
- **Historical significance** - The city's long history provides opportunities for encounters with older mysteries
