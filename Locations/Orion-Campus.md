# ORION International Command Campus

**Type:** Corporate headquarters / Research facility  
**Location:** North of Mission, BC near Stave Lake  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

The **ORION International Command Campus** is the headquarters of [[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|Orion International]], a massive facility hidden deep in the forests near Stave Lake. The campus serves as both the public face of ORION's resource and remote-sensing operations and the secret heart of their surveillance and anomaly research activities.

## Why Here?

### Geography & Secrecy

- **Proximity to Vancouver:** Easy access to urban infrastructure, airport, and BC government offices, while still isolated enough for secret operations and security.
- **Dense Forest & Water Barriers:** The campus sits a few kilometers north of the town of Mission, set deep in the new-growth forests along the lower slope leading towards Stave Lake. The lake, feeder creeks, and rolling terrain provide extensive natural perimeter security, with only restricted roads in and out.
- **Tech Infrastructure:** Tapped into early fiber trunk lines running from Vancouver to northern resource towns, plus close access to both rural power grids and hidden military radio relays.
- **Local Pattern:** The Stave Lake area and hills have historic high-strangeness: electrical storms, mining ghost towns, weird animal disappearances—making it a plausible site for ORION's justification as a "technology and research campus."

## Campus Layout & Features

### Perimeter

- **Gated Security Roads:** Only two paved, badge-controlled entries, each with retractable tiger traps and reinforced gates.
- **Forest Buffer:** 800 meters of planted fir and cedar, with subtle motion sensors, infrared cameras, and patrols by unmarked security vehicles.
- **Fenced Interior:** Decorative but surprisingly robust fencing lined with copper mesh, explained as "EM shielding against lightning strikes" (really: partial veil-thinning defense).

### Main Campus

#### Central Command Center

- Brutalist "hub" structure—not tall but sprawling, with a featureless, matte black upper ring. The core has high, narrow slit windows that glare with blue-white light at night.
- **Lobby:** Reception under a massive, color-coded schematic of the ORION satellite network; must check in via "biometric palm scanner"—also capable of reading subtle electromagnetic anomalies in visitors (screening for psychic or other contamination).

#### Operations Room

- Two dozen workstations, each with multiple CRT monitors—one wall is floor-to-ceiling displays showing real-time, static-filled satellite imagery of the Northwest, tiled sensor maps, and surveillance feeds.
- **Ticker boards:** Scroll with incident codes ("GLASSBIRD / C-12 / LEVEL YELLOW") and anomalous keywords.

#### Data Archives

- Rows of magnetic tape drives, punch card cabinets, and "cold storage" vaults behind triple-key, faraday-shielded titanium doors.
- **Exceptions Vault:** A glass-windowed, red-lit secure room—a few dozen steel cases, each marked with case codes (e.g. "NIGHT TIMBER-5").

#### Labs & Workshops

- Electronics and material science labs experimenting on anomalous samples—often working in full tyvek suits.
- Machine shops for drone/probe repair, some hidden rooms with shielded project data for AI and "other response" systems.

### Outbuildings

- **Maintenance Sheds:** Supposedly for groundskeeping and vehicles; really, many are disguised storage units for field equipment or rapid-response gear.
- **Satellite Dishes:** Arrayed in an arc behind the main building, screening the campus from aerial surveillance, always humming—some point at local sky, others at "deep" fields up and down the province.
- **Bunkered Observation Post:** A low concrete 'weather station' on a nearby ridge—actually a disguised remote observation hub with direct line-of-sight to both the campus and a known [[Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas|thin veil area]] two kilometers east.

## Atmosphere and Stories

- **Staff Dress:** Color-coded labcoats and security badges. Field officers arrive coated in BC forest mud.
- **Scent/Air:** Ozone tinge inside industrial halls; always a background hum or "heartbeat" from the mainframe core.
- **Local Lore:**
  - Logging crews whisper about strange blue lights above the trees after midnight. Local kids dare each other to touch the fence, swearing it "shocks you even with gloves on."
  - Rumor has it Orion's nighttime shifts always double when there's fog or electrical storms—some believe they "hunt ghosts in the woods."
  - Occasional late-night "surveys" by Zodiac boats on Stave Lake, searching for "geomagnetic fluctuations."

## Adventure Hooks

- A **data vault alarm** goes off—the PCs must investigate a breach during a thunderstorm, as power flickers and something (or someone) tries to escape the red-lit archives.
- Satellite **prediction maps** go haywire: multiple thin veil events spike around Mission, and staff act increasingly distracted, forgetful, or "possessed."
- **ORION security demands help** with a "field abduction" gone wrong in the woods east of the campus—it seems a [[Creatures/Aliens/Greys|Grey]] was caught by both ORION and a cult at once, and now they're all converging on a glimmering "door" in the forest.
- A rogue scientist attempts to leak evidence to **[[Locations/University-of-British-Columbia|UBC]] or the press**, needing player intervention to make it off-site safely past Men in Black infiltrators posing as janitorial staff.

## In Summary

The ORION campus near Stave Lake is an isolated, cutting-edge "resource and surveillance" complex, humming with unseen psychic warding, endlessly streaming anomaly reports, and surrounded by both suspicious silence and the eternal breath of the deep forest—making it ground zero for high-tech, high-strangeness, and institutional paranoia.
