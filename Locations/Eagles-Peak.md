## Eagles Peak Automated Mine

Eagles Peak is a very visible location that requires mining operations, necessitating a shell company to operate. The **Eagles Peak Automated Mine** operates under a corporate front, extracting minerals of interest to various factions—particularly those with connections to alien technology or paranormal research.

The mine's automated operations allow for minimal human presence, making it easier to conceal unusual activities or experiments. The remote location and harsh conditions provide natural cover for operations that might attract unwanted attention.
