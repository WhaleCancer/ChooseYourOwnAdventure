# Magical Fetishes

**Type:** Equipment / Protective items  
**Origin:** First Nations traditional knowledge  
**Era:** Ancient to present

## Overview

**Magical Fetishes** are traditional First Nations protective items and tools, created through ritual and imbued with spiritual power. These items can provide protection against supernatural threats, aid in investigations, and help resist [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) influence. They are often created by [Circle of Watchers](./Factions/Circle-of-Watchers.md) members or other traditional knowledge-keepers.

## Common Fetishes

### 1. Thunderbird Feather Bundle

A cluster of shed feathers wrapped in red thread that, when shaken or brandished at the sky, can summon a protective clap of thunder or dispel fog and electrical interference for a scene.

### 2. Raven Stone

A small black pebble painted with stylized raven wings, found in riverbeds. Holding it in a closed fist allows the bearer to walk unnoticed for a short time; sounds seem to "bend away" from them.

### 3. Talking Stick of Cedar

A carved staff with inlaid abalone. Speaking while holding the stick causes listeners to feel compelled to tell the truth or reveal secrets, especially effective on the possessed or those hiding supernatural knowledge.

### 4. Coppershield Amulet

Tiny beaten copper disk engraved with a salmon or crescent face; worn on a thong. Protects the wearer from psychic intrusion and blocks mind control for a short duration.

### 5. Moon-Eye Mask

A small wooden mask (fits in palm), painted black and white. When placed over one's face or shown to a specter, the true nature of ghosts, entities, or shapeshifters is revealed in brief flashes.

### 6. Fisher's Hair Cord

Plaited hair from a river otter or mink, knotted into a ring. While wearing it, the user can swim without tiring and holds their breath twice as long. If burned, it dispels water-based spirits or breaks a drowning curse.

### 7. Woven Spirit Ring

Grass and cedar bark woven into a ring, sometimes with inset crow feathers. Wards a house or camp from nightly visitations or "doorway spirits" crossing the Veil.

### 8. Ancestor Stone

Smooth river stone painted with a family cree or face. Whispered prayers to this stone give the user a brief vision from an ancestor, often providing warnings about nearby "thin places" or spirits.

### 9. Slayer's Charm Bag

Leather pouch with bear claws, shreds of red cloth, and a tiny carved wolf. Worn around the neck, it grants a surge of physical strength or ferocity in the face of a supernatural threat.

### 10. Copper-Edge Dagger

Traditional knife, mostly ceremonial. When used to cut, it severs ethereal bindings or "leashes," preventing entities from tracking or controlling the target.

### 11. Thunder-Stone Rattle

Gourd rattle with stones said to have fallen from the sky. When shaken, it clears psychic confusion, dispels illusions, and can weaken mind-altering veil effects in a 30-foot area.

### 12. Heron Bone Whistle

Delicate, carved flute that plays a near-silent note. When blown, it calls protective animal spirits to harry an enemy, disrupt an abduction, or send "signs" through birds/wildlife.

### 13. Sun-in-the-Tree Pendant

Amber or yellow glass set in a silver disk carved with tree branches. Prevents sleep paralysis, fear dreams, or being "drawn out" by the [Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)/Elohim at night.

### 14. Dreamcatcher of the Old Road

Hand-woven hoop with ancient glass beads and sheep's wool. Hung above a bed or carried, it catches abduction dreams and, if burned at sunrise, reveals hidden memories to the owner.

### 15. Bear's Palm Drum

Hand drum painted with a bear's paw; when played in [thin veil areas](./Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas.md), it can "thicken" the boundaries temporarily or drive baneful spirits away.

### 16. Hummingbird Resin Charm

Small vial of congealed tree sap hung from a cord, always sticky. When broken open, it "sweetens" the air, lowering aggression in other creatures (including cryptids).

### 17. Frog's Crossing Token

Bone or shell amulet carved with frog motifs. Safe passage over rivers, lakes, or wetlands; acts as an exorcism focus against water-spirits or monsters.

### 18. Spider's Web Knot

Bit of silk twisted and knotted in a silver ring. Can be looped around an object or person to "hold" them in place supernaturally, preventing abduction or vanishing.

### 19. Sense-Shifting Stones

Pair of pebbles—one warm, one cool—kept in a pouch. When held to the eyes or mouth, allows the user to perceive hidden Veil anomalies (echoes, warmth, voice), once per scene.

### 20. Ancestor's Sash

Handwoven wool sash decorated with familial and animal motifs, often inherited. When wrapped around shoulders, grants spiritual clarity and a one-time defense against direct psychic attack/possession.

## Additional Fetishes

Many more fetishes exist, specific to different First Nations traditions and regions. These items are typically:

- Created through traditional methods and rituals
- Blessed by elders or medicine people
- Connected to specific spirits or ancestors
- Most effective when used by those with proper training or spiritual connection
- May require maintenance, re-blessing, or specific conditions to function

## In Play

### Game Considerations

- Fetishes should feel authentic and respectful to First Nations traditions

- Some fetishes may be one-use, others may be permanent
- Proper use may require knowledge or training
- Misuse or disrespect may cause the fetish to lose power or backfire
