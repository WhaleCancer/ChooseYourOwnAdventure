## Prescription Opioids (1980s)

### Overview

Before the late‑1990s OxyContin wave, prescription opioids in the 1980s revolve around **codeine, Percocet, Vicodin, Demerol, Dilaudid, and morphine**. They come from hospitals, dentists, pain clinics, and crooked doctors, then leak into the street through theft, doctor‑shopping, and small‑scale pill deals. For some users they are a step up from alcohol; for others, a pharmaceutical road to full heroin addiction.

### Street Forms

- **Pill bottles and loose tablets**: Saved from old prescriptions, stolen from relatives, or bought from hospital staff.  
- **Liquid cough syrups with codeine**: Mixed into drinks for a sweeter, slower high.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Prescription Opioids – Numb but Functional**
  - **Immediate benefits**:
    - Reduce or negate penalties from **light to moderate injuries** for the duration of a scene or hour.  
    - Bonus on **resisting pain‑based coercion** and interrogation.  
    - If your system tracks hit locations or wound thresholds, treat certain wounds as one step less severe while dosed.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalties to **alertness**, **reaction**, and fine coordination tasks.  
    - Penalties on **complex problem‑solving** as drowsiness and comfort blunt focus.  
    - On a Body/Constitution test when combining with other depressants:
      - Failure: user becomes **very drowsy**, risking microsleeps and dropped actions.  
      - Critical failure: **overdose**, leading to respiratory failure, unconsciousness, or death without medical intervention.
  - **Addiction**:
    - Each non‑medical or long‑term use demands a Willpower‑style check.  
    - Failed checks advance an addiction track; addicted characters suffer **withdrawal** when off the drug:
      - Restlessness, pain sensitivity, anxiety, and penalties to social and concentration rolls until they secure more or complete withdrawal downtime.  
    - Pill supply and prescriptions provide excellent hooks: pharmacy robberies, doctor blackmail, clinic raids, and cartel‑hospital connections.
