## Barbiturates

### Overview

Barbiturates are an older class of **sedative‑hypnotic drugs** that peaked before the 1980s but still linger in the medicine cabinets of older users and the inventories of shady clinics. In the street scene they are known as heavy “downers,” more dangerous and less fashionable than benzodiazepines but still used for blackout‑level sleep or extreme self‑medication.

### Street Forms

- **Capsules and tablets**: Old prescriptions for sleep or epilepsy; sometimes stolen from hospital or pharmacy stocks.  
- **Mixed with alcohol**: Common and extremely dangerous combination, often involved in overdose deaths.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Barbiturates – Oblivion Pills**
  - **Activation**: Rarely used as a tactical buff; more often a story item or desperate choice.  
  - **Duration**: Long sedation with heavy drawbacks.  
  - **Possible implementations**:
    - **Pre‑mission sedation**: Player wakes up partway into a scenario with blurred vision and fragments of memory (good for narrative flashbacks or unreliable POV).  
    - As a **fail‑state** or “escape” item: voluntarily taking enough may skip a scene at the cost of lost time, resources, or reputation.
  - **If forced as a combat buff** (very risky):
    - Small reduction in **weapon sway** and **fear effects**.  
    - Severe penalty to **movement**, **reload**, and **aim speed**.  
    - High chance of **collapse**: screen narrowing, fall to the ground, and a need for allies or med‑kits to recover.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Barbiturates – Heavy Downers**
  - **Possible uses**:
    - As a **sleeping agent**: guarantee deep sleep, ignoring normal disturbances (great for surgery, kidnapping, or theft plots).  
    - As a **poison/overdose threat**: NPCs slip them into drinks, or PCs overdose intentionally or by accident.
  - **Mechanical effects**:
    - When taken at therapeutic doses:
      - Bonus to resist **insomnia** and mild stress; easier to recover during rest scenes.  
      - Penalty to **initiative**, **awareness**, and **reaction** for the next scene or two.
    - At high doses or when combined with alcohol/other depressants:
      - Significant penalty to all **physical** and **mental** actions.  
      - On a Body/Constitution test:
        - Failure: **unconscious** for hours, easily harmed or manipulated.  
        - Critical failure: **overdose**, requiring immediate medical aid and potentially permanent consequences (brain damage, coma, or death).
    - **Addiction**:
      - Less common in the 1980s than earlier, but entrenched users may need a dose to sleep at all.  
      - Withdrawal can impose **anxiety, tremors, and seizure risk**, giving the GM rich hooks for medical or criminal complications.
