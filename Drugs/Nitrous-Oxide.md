## Nitrous Oxide (Whippets)

### Overview

Nitrous oxide is an **inhaled gas** used medically as an anesthetic and recreationally for its brief, euphoric head‑rush. In a 1980s urban setting, it appears at parties, concerts, and underground scenes where people crack open small gas cartridges (“whippets”) normally used for whipped cream dispensers. The high is short but memorable, often layered with music, lights, and laughter.

### Street Forms

- **Whippets**: Small metal gas cartridges discharged into balloons, then inhaled.  
- **Medical tanks**: Larger, riskier setups stolen from dental or medical suppliers.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Nitrous – Flash Rush**
  - **Activation**: Very fast; can be done even mid‑combat, but effect is extremely short.  
  - **Duration**: A few seconds of slowed perception.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Brief **time dilation** effect: slight bullet‑time, improved target acquisition.  
    - Small temporary **damage resistance** or hitbox forgiveness, representing dulled pain and altered perception.  
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Immediately after the rush, a short **dizzy phase**: visual blur, muffled audio, slower movement.  
    - Repeated use in quick succession can cause **fainting** or collapse, dropping the character to the ground and forcing a recovery period.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Nitrous – Laughing Gas**
  - **Immediate benefits**:
    - Very short‑term bonus against **fear, pain, and anxiety** in a single moment or action.  
    - Possible bonus to **morale** or comic relief in social scenes, loosening tension.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Immediately afterward, impose penalties to **balance, coordination, and attention** for a few rounds.  
    - Characters may giggle uncontrollably, slur speech, and struggle with precise tasks.  
    - On a Body/Constitution test after repeated hits:
      - Failure: brief **loss of balance** or fall; lose an action.  
      - Critical failure: **blackout** or oxygen deprivation event with potential minor but lasting harm at GM’s discretion.
  - **Setting role**:
    - Fits well into **club back rooms, raves, concert parking lots, and underground parties**, often mixed with other drugs.  
    - Large stolen tanks or medical‑grade supplies can become evidence, loot, or props in heists and raids.
