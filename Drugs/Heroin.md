## Heroin

### Overview

Heroin is the **classic street opiate** of the 1980s: burned spoons in motel rooms, nodding users in alleyways, and bundled “bags” changing hands in housing projects and underpasses. It flows into the city through international smuggling routes, often controlled by organized crime, but the last‑mile dealing is typically in the hands of desperate users and ruthless street crews.

### Street Forms

- **Powder / tar**: Snorted, smoked (“chasing the dragon”), or dissolved and injected.  
- **Bundles / bags**: Small wax paper folds, balloons, or plastic wraps sold by name‑brand “stamps.”

### FPS Game Effects

- **Heroin – Numbing Calm**
  - **Activation**: Slower to use (syringe, spoon kit, or foil) and not suited to mid‑fight consumption.  
  - **Duration**: Long‑lasting; one full mission segment or several minutes of real time.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Strong **damage resistance** to minor hits (chip damage reduced).  
    - Reduced **screen shake** from pain and minor explosions.  
    - Slight **reduction in fear effects** (less camera shake/blur during scary events).
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Slower **movement speed** and **reload**; heavier aim sway from drowsiness.  
    - If taken before combat, initial **warm‑up phase** with blurred vision or tunnel vision.  
    - High chance of **overdose** if stacked with other depressants (alcohol, sedatives): abrupt health collapse requiring revival item or ally.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Heroin – Painkiller Numbness**
  - **Immediate benefits** (can last for multiple scenes or an in‑game hour):
    - User gains a significant bonus to **resisting pain**: reduced penalties from wounds, torture, or shock.  
    - May treat certain wound penalties as one step lower during the effect.  
    - Reduced anxiety: slight bonus on checks vs. **fear or panic**.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Apply penalties to **initiative**, **reflexes**, and any **fine coordination** actions.  
    - Penalty on **awareness/perception** checks; the character is slow to notice danger.  
    - On a failed Body/Constitution roll:
      - User becomes **drowsy or nodding**: chances to lose their action, drop items, or miss details the GM describes.  
      - Severe failure can mean **overdose**: unconscious, dying, or requiring immediate medical attention.
    - **Addiction**:
      - Each use requires a Willpower‑style check; failures move the character along an addiction track.  
      - At high addiction levels, going without heroin imposes penalties: shakes, sweating, agitation, penalties to social rolls, and difficulty focusing until they score a fix or ride out withdrawal downtime.
