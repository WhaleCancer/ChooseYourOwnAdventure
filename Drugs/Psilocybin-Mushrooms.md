## Psilocybin Mushrooms

### Overview

Psilocybin mushrooms are **naturally occurring psychedelics** favored by hippies, bohemians, college students, and certain occult or nature‑oriented groups. In a grimy 1980s city, they show up at small concerts, art parties, and backrooms of occult or “new age” bookstores, offering introspective trips rather than hard‑edge street violence.

### Street Forms

- **Dried mushrooms**: Sold by weight in small bags, eaten directly or mixed with food.  
- **Teas**: Brewed into bitter drinks to mask the taste.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Psilocybin – Soft Trip**
  - **Activation**: Typically a pre‑level or story event; not a conventional mid‑fight power‑up.  
  - **Duration**: One level or extended sequence.  
  - **Possible positive effects**:
    - Environmental **highlights** on clues, hidden paths, or symbolic objects, helping exploration.  
    - Softening of **fear effects** in horror‑leaning levels—the world feels strange but less immediately threatening.
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Gentle but persistent **visual distortion**: breathing textures, color shifts, tracers.  
    - Occasional **misleading silhouettes** or shadows that look like enemies but vanish—false positives.  
    - Slight lag in **aim responsiveness** to simulate altered body perception.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Psilocybin – Introspective Vision**
  - **Possible benefits**:
    - Bonus to **creative thinking**, lateral approaches, or interpreting symbols, dreams, and occult texts.  
    - The GM can grant **vision scenes**: cryptic glimpses of NPC motives, future dangers, or personal backstory.  
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalties to **combat effectiveness**, driving, or high‑risk physical tasks while peaking.  
    - Difficulty with **linear conversation**; impose penalties on fast‑paced negotiations or interrogations.  
    - In threatening situations, require Willpower checks:
      - Failure may cause the character to **freeze**, laugh inappropriately, or fixate on irrelevant details.  
      - Critical failure could trigger a **paranoid spiral** or full panic.
  - **Role in the setting**:
    - A tool for **vision quests**, cult initiations, or spiritual retreats contrasted against harder street drugs.  
    - Provides a way for players to voluntarily accept **narrative vulnerability** in return for insight and character development.
