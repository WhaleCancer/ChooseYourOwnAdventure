## Cannabis and Hashish

### Overview

Cannabis is the most **widely used illicit drug** of the 1980s, cutting across class and subculture lines—from bikers and rockers to students, artists, and office workers. Hashish (pressed resin) is more compact and potent, often linked to international smuggling routes. For many, weed is a casual recreational drug; for organized crime, it is a steady, low‑risk revenue stream.

### Street Forms

- **Marijuana (weed)**: Dried flowers, smoked in joints, pipes, or bongs.  
- **Hashish (hash)**: Pressed resin blocks or slabs, crumbled into tobacco or cannabis mixes.  
- **Edibles**: Baked goods or homemade recipes, less common but present in certain circles.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Cannabis – Relaxed Focus**
  - **Activation**: Light up between fights or at safe points; not ideal mid‑combat.  
  - **Duration**: Medium; one section of a level.  
  - **Possible positive effects**:
    - Reduced **stress effects**: less heavy breathing, softer screen shake from near misses.  
    - Slight boost to **hip‑fire stability** at close range (relaxed, instinctive shooting).  
    - Colors and sound become warmer, making exploration sequences feel richer.
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Mild **sluggishness**: slower sprint acceleration and slower aim‑down‑sights.  
    - Slight delay in reaction to sudden threats; enemies may get the first shot more often.  
    - Overuse may induce a **paranoid audio filter**—distant whispers and heightened ambience—without actually improving detection.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Cannabis – Chill and Paranoid Edges**
  - **Possible benefits**:
    - Minor bonus to **stress resistance** in low‑intensity scenes (downtime, social gatherings).  
    - Bonus to **creative or associative thinking**, brainstorming, or certain artistic/technical tasks when time pressure is low.  
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Small penalties to **initiative**, **reaction**, and high‑speed combat tasks.  
    - Penalties on **short‑term memory tasks**—recalling exact details, code sequences, or brief instructions.  
    - On anxiety‑prone characters, the GM can call for Willpower checks:
      - Failure triggers **paranoia**: the character over‑interprets threats, misreads NPC intentions, or insists on over‑cautious plans.  
  - **Setting role**:
    - Common background drug in **bars, music clubs, biker hangouts, and after‑hours parties**.  
    - Low‑level dealers and smugglers can be tied to bigger organizations, giving the GM easy hooks to escalate from “harmless weed” to major crime plots.
