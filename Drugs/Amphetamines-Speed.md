## Amphetamines and “Speed”

### Overview

Amphetamines are **everyday stimulants** in the 1980s: prescription “diet pills,” trucker uppers, biker crank, and student study drugs. They bridge the gap between high‑end cocaine and back‑alley meth, showing up in pill bottles, matchbooks, and greasy truck‑stop bathrooms. Biker gangs, shady doctors, and small‑time chemists all have a stake in the trade.

### Street Forms

- **Pills / tablets**: Legitimate prescriptions (diet pills, ADHD meds), sold or traded on the street.  
- **Powder / crank**: Cheap, dirty amphetamine powder sold in baggies, snorted or swallowed.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Amphetamines – Wired Alertness**
  - **Activation**: Quick to pop; can be done right before or even during combat.  
  - **Duration**: Medium—long enough for a full engagement or section of a level.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Noticeably increased **movement speed** and **stamina** (longer sprint bar, faster stamina regen).  
    - Faster **aim‑down‑sights** transition and **reload**.  
    - Slight boost to **time‑to‑aim** and target acquisition (reduced initial sway).
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Increased **weapon spread** at long range (tremors).  
    - After effect, apply a **Crash** debuff: slower sprint regen, small accuracy penalty, and heavier breathing audio.  
    - Repeated doses in a short time window:
      - Chance of **cardiac episode**: sudden health loss and forced slowdown.  
      - Strong screen shake and sound distortion to represent over‑stimulation.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Amphetamines – Wired but Shaky**
  - **Immediate benefits** (one scene or a few hours in‑game):
    - Bonus to **initiative** and **reaction** or **drive/pilot** checks.  
    - Bonus on **staying awake**, long surveillance, or extended tasks (stakeouts, hacking marathons).  
    - Small boost on **short‑term focus** tasks (tracking multiple threats, scanning for ambush).
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalties on **fine dexterity** actions requiring steadiness (sniping, surgery, bomb defusal).  
    - Penalty on **sleep‑related** or **calm social** checks—character is jittery, talkative, or irritable.  
    - After the beneficial period, apply **Crash**:
      - Penalty to **stamina/endurance** rolls and **concentration**.  
      - GM may impose a risk of errors during complex actions as exhaustion sets in.
    - **Addiction**:
      - Each use calls for a Willpower‑style roll; failures advance an addiction track.  
      - Addicted characters suffer penalties when **off** the drug (sluggish, depressed) and may take impulsive risks to obtain more.
