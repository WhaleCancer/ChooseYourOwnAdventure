## Benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax, Ativan)

### Overview

Benzodiazepines are **tranquilizers** prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms. In the 1980s they are everywhere—doctor’s offices, medicine cabinets, purses, and the pockets of nervous club managers and mob lawyers. On the street, “benzos” are traded to smooth out stimulant highs, help come down from cocaine or speed, or simply to escape stress and trauma.

### Street Forms

- **Pills**: Branded tablets (Valium, Librium, Xanax in late‑80s, Ativan, etc.), often traded loose in small bags or foil.  
- **Cocktails**: Mixed with alcohol or other depressants, greatly increasing overdose risk.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Benzos – Steady Hands, Slowed Reflexes**
  - **Activation**: Popped before a mission or during low‑intensity moments, not ideal mid‑firefight.  
  - **Duration**: Long—covers a large section of a mission.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Reduced **weapon sway** when aiming, especially for snipers or precision shots.  
    - Diminished **fear/shock effects**: less camera shake from explosions and jump scares.  
    - Slight increase in **suppression resistance** (less visual blur from incoming fire).
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Slower **movement** and **aim‑down‑sights** speed.  
    - Longer **reload times** and slower weapon swapping.  
    - If combined with other depressants (heroin, alcohol), chance of **sudden blackout**: temporary loss of player control, screen fade, or forced stagger animation.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Benzos – Calm at a Cost**
  - **Immediate benefits** (last several hours or multiple scenes):
    - Bonus on **fear, panic, and interrogation** resistance checks.  
    - Bonus on any check to **stay calm under pressure** (defusing a bomb, negotiating with a gun in your face).  
    - Small bonus on **steady‑hand** tasks like sniping or surgery, if time pressure is moderate.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalty to **initiative** and any test relying on fast reaction or sudden movement.  
    - Penalty to **memory, focus, and complex problem‑solving** while under the influence.  
    - On a failed Body/Constitution test:
      - The character becomes **drowsy**: chance to lose actions, fall asleep unintentionally, or miss details.  
      - Serious failure when mixed with other depressants can cause **respiratory depression**: unconsciousness or dying state.
    - **Addiction**:
      - Repeated use calls for Willpower‑style checks; failures mark psychological dependence.  
      - Without access, anxious or traumatized characters may suffer **withdrawal anxiety** penalties to social and concentration rolls.
