## Cocaine and Crack Cocaine

### Overview

Cocaine is the **status stimulant** of the 1980s—white lines on glass tables in back rooms of nightclubs, motels, and strip‑club offices. Crack is the cheaper, smokable rock form that explodes into devastated neighborhoods and gives street gangs a brutal, fast‑cash market. Cartels, biker gangs, and organized crime use cocaine as a prestige product, while crack pushes violence and police heat into the poorest parts of the city.

### Street Forms

- **Powder cocaine**: Fine white powder, sold in grams or “eight‑balls,” snorted or injected.  
- **Crack rocks**: Small off‑white “rocks” smoked in glass pipes, improvised tubes, or mixed with tobacco/cannabis.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Cocaine – Combat Boost**
  - **Activation**: Instant use, short cooldown or limited charges.  
  - **Duration**: 20–40 seconds of in‑game time.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Increased **movement speed** and **reload speed**.  
    - Slight **recoil reduction** and faster **weapon swap**.  
    - Mild **aim sway reduction** (hyper‑focus).
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - After effect, apply a **Crash**: brief period of **slower movement**, slightly **worse accuracy**, and muted colors to simulate fatigue.  
    - Repeated use in a short period greatly increases chance of:
      - Temporary **heart‑attack event** (screen darkening, heavy damage) or  
      - Short **blurred vision and tinnitus**.

- **Crack – Aggressive Frenzy**
  - **Activation**: Slower to consume, but more intense short buff.  
  - **Duration**: 10–20 seconds.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Strong **sprint speed boost** and **melee damage buff**.  
    - Faster **hip‑fire** rate of fire, especially with SMGs and pistols.  
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Greatly increased **aim spread** when aiming down sights (twitchy, frantic).  
    - Heavy **Crash**: drained stamina bar, slowed reload, and maybe a **temporary inability to sprint**.  
    - If used while already low on health, small chance of instant incapacitation (overdose).

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

Use these as templates; adjust numbers to your system (e.g., bonuses as advantage, +2, or extra dice).

- **Cocaine – Focused High**
  - **Immediate benefits** (last for one scene or 10–30 in‑game minutes):
    - Gain a bonus to **initiative** and **reaction** checks.  
    - Gain a bonus to **short‑term alertness**: perception vs. ambush, fast talking, or intimidation rolls.  
    - Gain a small bonus on **fine motor skills** (picking locks, quick reloads) but only under time pressure.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - After the scene, the user suffers **Fatigue**:
      - Penalty to **endurance / stamina** rolls.  
      - Penalty on **concentration** or **steady‑hand** tasks (sniping, delicate work).  
    - On a failed **Body/Constitution** test:
      - The character suffers **heart palpitations**: temporary max‑HP reduction or minor damage and disadvantage on physical exertion checks for the rest of the session.  
    - **Addiction track**: each use requires a Willpower‑style check; on failure, mark a craving. Craving can impose penalties when sober until the character uses again.

- **Crack – Street Frenzy**
  - **Immediate benefits** (shorter than cocaine—one combat or a few minutes):
    - Bonus to **initiative** and **close‑range attacks** (melee, shotguns, pistols).  
    - Temporary **pain resistance**: ignore light wound penalties during the high.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - After the encounter, impose severe **Crash**:
      - Disadvantage (or larger penalty) on **social interactions**, **planning**, and any **calm decision‑making**.  
      - Penalty to **ranged precision** rolls.  
    - On a failed Body/Constitution test:
      - Short episode of **paranoia**: player must make a Willpower check to avoid overreacting, misreading threats, or attacking the wrong target.  
    - **Addiction**: crack advances an addiction track faster than powder cocaine; fewer failed checks are needed before the character starts taking ongoing penalties if they don’t use.
