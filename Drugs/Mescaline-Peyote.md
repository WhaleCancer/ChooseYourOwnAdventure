## Mescaline (Peyote and San Pedro)

### Overview

Mescaline is a **traditional psychedelic** found in certain cacti (peyote, San Pedro). In many regions it is tied to indigenous and spiritual practices, but in a crime setting it also appears among fringe occult groups, desert bikers, and seekers chasing “authentic” visions. Compared to heroin or cocaine, the market is small but charged with mystique and cultural tension.

### Street Forms

- **Dried cactus buttons or slices**: Chewed or brewed into foul‑tasting teas.  
- **Extracts**: Rare, more potent preparations traded among dedicated psychonauts or cult leaders.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Mescaline – Vision Quest**
  - **Activation**: Story or ritual item used during specific narrative sequences, not a common combat buff.  
  - **Duration**: One vision episode, flashback, or dream‑like level.  
  - **Possible positive effects**:
    - **Symbolic overlays** on the world that hint at hidden routes, secrets, or moral choices.  
    - Temporary “**detect presence**” effect: hostile entities subtly outlined or represented as spirits.  
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - The environment becomes **mythic and disorienting**: warped geometry, shifting skies, surreal enemies.  
    - Player may briefly lose normal HUD elements, relying on intuition and environmental cues.  
    - Delayed reactions and input lag may simulate moving through a dream.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Mescaline – Ritual Psychedelic**
  - **Possible benefits**:
    - During guided rituals, characters gain bonuses to **vision, divination, or spiritual insight** rolls.  
    - The GM can deliver **symbolic prophecies** or glimpses of deeper setting truths.  
    - Characters may gain temporary bonuses to **resisting supernatural influences**, framed as spiritual alignment or guidance.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - While under peak effects, impose penalties to **physical coordination, combat, and mundane tasks**.  
    - Social interactions with non‑participants suffer; the character is half in another world.  
    - If the ritual is interrupted or hostile forces intrude, require Willpower checks:
      - Failure may produce **panic, confusion, or misplaced faith** in deceptive visions.  
      - Critical failure could inflict a lingering **psychic scar**—phobias, compulsions, or occasional intrusive visions in later sessions.
  - **Cultural weight**:
    - Use respectfully: some NPCs may view casual or criminal commercialization as **desecration**, creating story hooks around sacred versus profane use.  
    - Conflicts over access (cartels vs. traditional communities vs. occult groups) can anchor powerful plotlines.
