## Inhalants (Glue, Paint, Aerosols)

### Overview

Inhalants are **cheap, toxic highs** drawn from everyday products: glue, spray paint, solvents, gasoline, aerosol cans. In the 1980s they are associated with runaway kids, the very poor, and desperate users who cannot afford other drugs. They show up around abandoned buildings, alleys behind stores, and forgotten corners of arcades and pool halls.

### Street Forms

- **Glue and solvents**: In bags or rags, huffed repeatedly.  
- **Spray paint and aerosols**: Sprayed into a bag or directly into a cloth pressed to the face.  
- **Gasoline and fuels**: Fumes inhaled from containers in secluded spots.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Inhalants – Brief, Dangerous Buzz**
  - **Activation**: Quick but clumsy; fits as a desperate or self‑destructive action.  
  - **Duration**: Very short; seconds to a minute of real time.  
  - **Possible positive effects**:
    - Very brief **euphoria**: reduced fear and pain response, slight damage reduction for a few moments.  
    - Stylized visual/audio distortion that might make some players more daring.
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Immediate **vision blur**, tunnel vision, and heavy sound distortion.  
    - Chance of **stumbling or collapsing**, with impaired controls.  
    - Repeated use can trigger **sudden death** or serious health loss (heart failure, brain damage), making it more a narrative element than a smart mechanical choice.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Inhalants – Cheap Escape**
  - **Immediate effects**:
    - Short‑lived sense of **euphoria or detachment**; small bonus against immediate fear or emotional stress.  
    - Characters may feel reckless, laugh at danger, or disconnect from grim surroundings.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Significant penalties to **perception, coordination, and reasoning** during and shortly after use.  
    - Increased chance of **critical fumbles** on any physical or mental task.  
    - On a Body/Constitution test:
      - Failure: nausea, vomiting, dizziness—disadvantage or penalties for the rest of the scene.  
      - Critical failure: **loss of consciousness**, seizures, or permanent damage (GM option: reduction in an attribute like Intelligence or Health).
  - **Addiction and long‑term harm**:
    - Frequent users show **memory problems, irritability, and neurological damage**, which can be modeled as accumulating penalties or flaws.  
    - Inhalants are ideal for portraying **tragic background NPCs or PCs at rock bottom**, emphasizing social decay around the edges of the main criminal world.
