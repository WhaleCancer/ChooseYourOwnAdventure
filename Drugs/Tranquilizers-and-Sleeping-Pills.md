## Tranquilizers and Sleeping Pills (Non-Benzodiazepines)

### Overview

Alongside benzodiazepines and barbiturates, the 1980s see widespread use of **miscellaneous tranquilizers and sleeping pills**: older sedatives, antihistamines pressed into service as sleep aids, and off‑label prescriptions. They are less glamorous than cocaine and heroin, but they lubricate the nightlife economy—helping club workers crash after shifts, calming anxious gangsters, and serving as quiet tools for predators who slip them into drinks.

### Street Forms

- **Prescription sleep meds and tranquilizers**: Various tablets and capsules, some outdated, some still common.  
- **Over‑the‑counter sleep aids**: Antihistamine‑based pills, cheap and accessible.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Tranquilizers/Sleepers – Forced Rest**
  - **Activation**: Rarely used as voluntary buffs; usually appear as **plot devices** (drugged drinks, kidnapping setups).  
  - **Duration**: Minutes to hours in story time, skipping segments of play.  
  - **Possible implementations**:
    - Player is **slipped a pill** in a drink: screen blur, controls lag, then blackout leading to a new scene (captured, robbed, relocated).  
    - Voluntary use may be an option to **skip time** or force sleep, at the cost of vulnerability and possible side‑effects upon waking.
  - **If modeled as a very soft buff**:
    - Slight reduction in **shake** from fear or shock in the short window before drowsiness.  
    - Rapid onset of **blur, double vision, and motor impairment**, making combat a poor idea.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Tranquilizers and Sleep Aids – Quiet Edge and Quiet Threat**
  - **Voluntary use**:
    - Bonuses to **falling asleep**, staying asleep, and recovering from stress during rest scenes.  
    - When overused, penalties the next day: **grogginess**, slowed reaction, and mild cognitive fog.  
  - **Involuntary or weaponized use**:
    - Slipping pills into a drink calls for **opposed checks** (deception vs. perception or similar).  
    - On failure by the target:
      - Gradual penalties to **coordination, perception, and resistance** over one scene.  
      - Eventual **unconsciousness**, opening the door to kidnapping, theft, or compromising photos/videos.
  - **Mechanics suggestions**:
    - Track a simple **sedation level**: each dose adds points; thresholds cause cumulative penalties and eventual unconsciousness.  
    - Mixing with other depressants (alcohol, opioids) lowers the threshold and raises the chance of **medical crisis**—respiratory depression, coma, or death on a bad Body/Constitution roll.  
  - **Setting role**:
    - Common in **hotel lounges, strip clubs, and seedy motels**, where predators and blackmailers may turn them into tools of control.  
    - Also a believable background habit for burned‑out cops, traumatized veterans, and overworked professionals trying to sleep through their guilt.
