## Alcohol

### Overview

Alcohol is **legal but omnipresent**, the social fuel of bars, biker clubhouses, strip clubs, hotel lounges, and seedy motels. It oils the machinery of organized crime: tabs run up with laundered money, bar owners squeezed for protection, and drunk patrons turned into easy marks. While socially accepted, in a gritty 1980s setting alcohol drives bar fights, DUIs, domestic violence, and reckless decisions.

### Street Forms

- **Beer and wine**: Everyday drinking, from cheap cans to upscale bottles.  
- **Hard liquor**: Whiskey, vodka, rum, gin—favored for fast intoxication and ritual toasts.  
- **Cheap fortified wines and spirits**: Drunk by the desperate in alleys, shelters, and rundown motels.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Alcohol – Liquid Courage**
  - **Activation**: Taken before combat or at safe points, occasionally mid‑fight with penalties.  
  - **Duration**: Medium; one mission segment.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Reduced **fear/shock response**: less visual/audio distortion from explosions or jump scares.  
    - Slight increase in **melee damage** and willingness to close distance.  
    - Temporary small boost in **resistance to intimidation** in dialogue or scripted scenes.
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Increased **weapon sway** and worse **long‑range accuracy**.  
    - Slower **movement, reload, and aim‑down‑sights**.  
    - At high intoxication: chance of **stumbling**, delayed input response, and double‑vision crosshair effect.  
    - If stacked heavily, the character can **black out**, skipping part of the mission and waking up disoriented somewhere else (narrative tool).

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Alcohol – Social Grease and Blunt Edge**
  - **Light drinking**:
    - Small bonus to **certain social rolls** (charm, camaraderie) in relaxed contexts.  
    - Slight reduction in **inhibitions**, helping characters say what they normally wouldn’t.  
  - **Heavy drinking**:
    - Penalties to **coordination**, **reflexes**, and **accurate shooting or driving**.  
    - Penalties to **judgment and self‑control**; GM may impose disadvantage on resisting temptations, taunts, or reckless dares.  
    - Increased likelihood of **misreading social cues**, escalating arguments into fights.
  - **Mechanics suggestion**:
    - Track a simple **intoxication level**: each drink adds points; at certain thresholds apply cumulative bonuses and larger penalties.  
    - Sobering up requires time, water/food, or medical attention; hangovers can impose penalties the next day (headache, nausea, sensitivity to light/sound).
  - **Setting role**:
    - Alcohol is the **default vice** at most of your listed locations, making it a constant background influence on NPC behavior and PC decisions.  
    - Bar tabs, DUIs, and drunken brawls are perfect hooks into larger faction conflicts and police attention.
