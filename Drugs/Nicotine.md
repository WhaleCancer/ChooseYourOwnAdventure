## Nicotine

### Overview

Nicotine, delivered mostly through **cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco**, is a legal but highly addictive stimulant that saturates your 1980s setting. Cops smoke in squad cars, bikers in clubhouses, dancers on smoke breaks behind strip clubs, and mobsters over every back‑room deal. It doesn’t produce dramatic intoxication like cocaine or heroin, but it shapes mood, stress, and identity—and quitting is its own kind of war.

### Street Forms

- **Cigarettes**: The default—cheap packs, premium brands, and smuggled cartons.  
- **Cigars**: Status symbols for bosses, celebratory toasts, and intimidation props.  
- **Chewing tobacco / snuff**: Favored by some bikers, athletes, and blue‑collar workers.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Nicotine – Smoke Break**
  - **Activation**: Quick use between firefights or in brief lulls; can be canceled if action starts.  
  - **Duration**: Short to medium; covers a few minutes or one encounter’s worth of “calm.”  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Slight boost to **stress recovery**: faster removal of heartbeat, heavy breathing, and red‑screen damage indicators when out of combat.  
    - Tiny bonus to **hand steadiness** for a moment after finishing (reduced initial sway when first aiming).  
    - Can serve as a **focus ritual**—used as a contextual interaction to regain a small amount of stamina or composure.
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Brief **in‑use vulnerability**: character slows or stands still, with field of view partly obscured by smoke and lighter animation.  
    - Long‑term, you can track a hidden **nicotine dependence**:
      - If the character goes too long without a smoke, apply a mild, persistent debuff: slower stamina regen, slight extra camera shake, or more noticeable breathing sounds.  
      - Having a cigarette lifts this debuff for a while.
  - **Optional stealth trade‑off**:
    - While smoking, small glowing ember and smoke trail can make the character more visible in darkness, and exhaled smoke can silhouette them under certain lights.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Nicotine – Habit and Edge**
  - **Light or non‑addicted use**:
    - A cigarette can grant a minor situational bonus to **composure** or **focus** checks in tense but not frantic scenes (planning a heist, interrogation standoffs, stakeouts).  
    - Good narrative excuse for players to buy time, think, and frame scenes: “We step outside for a smoke and talk this through.”
  - **Addicted characters**:
    - Track a simple **nicotine dependence**: after establishing the habit, going several hours of game time without smoking may impose:
      - Small penalties to **concentration**, **patience**, or **social restraint** (irritable, snappy).  
      - Penalties on long **stakeouts or paperwork** scenes as nerves fray.  
    - Taking a smoke break removes these penalties for a while and can give a minor bonus on **stress or willpower** checks tied to frustration or anxiety.
  - **Long‑term and flavor**:
    - Over long campaigns, heavy smokers may face health complications (cough, stamina reduction, medical warnings) if you want grittier realism, but this is optional.  
    - Nicotine use is also a **visual and roleplay tool**:
      - Lighting a cigarette to show nerves or faux calm.  
      - Offering or refusing a smoke as a sign of trust, dominance, or defiance in social scenes.  
      - Ashtrays, butts, and lingering smoke as environmental clues to recent activity at crime scenes.
