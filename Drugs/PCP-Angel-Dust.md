## PCP (Angel Dust)

### Overview

PCP is a **dissociative anesthetic** turned notorious street drug, associated with erratic, sometimes violently unpredictable behavior. In urban 1980s neighborhoods, it appears as powder sprinkled on joints or cigarettes (“sherms,” “wet”) or as crystals for smoking. Police, paramedics, and gang members all trade horror stories of users seemingly impervious to pain or fear.

### Street Forms

- **Powder / crystals**: Sprinkled onto tobacco or cannabis, or on parsley/other herbs to smoke.  
- **Dipped cigarettes**: Cigarettes dipped in PCP solution then dried, sold as “wet” or “sherms.”

### FPS Game Effects

- **PCP – Berserker High**
  - **Activation**: Deliberate pre‑fight choice; dangerous but powerful.  
  - **Duration**: One intense combat or a set amount of in‑game time.  
  - **Positive effects**:
    - Strong **damage resistance** to small arms and melee (reduced incoming damage).  
    - Temporary **immunity to pain‑stagger** and most fear effects.  
    - Melee attacks gain extra **damage** and **knockback**.
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Severely degraded **fine control**: wild recoil, heavy aim spread, poor long‑range accuracy.  
    - Chance of **friendly fire** events if the game supports it—twitchy targeting and accidental hits.  
    - Afterward, apply intense **Crash**: slowed movement, low health/stamina, distorted audio, and possible temporary movement impairment (stumbling).

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **PCP – Pain‑Blind Rage**
  - **Immediate benefits** (one combat or short timeframe):
    - Substantial bonus on checks to **ignore pain** and resist being stunned, knocked down, or scared.  
    - Reduction or removal of penalties from light and moderate wounds.  
    - Bonus to **melee damage** and **grappling** or **brawling** rolls.
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalty to **ranged attacks** requiring aim, and to **delicate actions** (lockpicking, disarming traps).  
    - GM may require **Willpower checks** to avoid assaulting the nearest perceived threat, even if it’s not the smartest target.  
    - Characters may misinterpret neutral or friendly NPCs as hostile under the influence if they fail perception or insight tests.
  - **After‑effects**:
    - Apply severe **exhaustion**: penalties to physical actions, social checks, and possibly temporary hit point/health reduction.  
    - Risk of **psychological fallout** (paranoia, flashbacks) as a recurring complication in future scenes if the drug is abused.
    - Addiction is less about craving and more about **thrill‑seeking and self‑destructive tendencies**, which the GM can model with compulsion‑style disadvantages or roleplay prompts.
