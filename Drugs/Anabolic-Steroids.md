## Anabolic Steroids

### Overview

Anabolic steroids are **performance‑enhancing drugs** used to build muscle, speed recovery, and boost aggression. In the 1980s they are strongly associated with bodybuilders, athletes, bouncers, security contractors, and some bikers and cops. While not a traditional “party drug,” they tie into black‑market gym networks, shady doctors, and locker‑room deals.

### Street Forms

- **Injectable steroids**: Vials and ampoules injected intramuscularly on cycles.  
- **Oral tablets**: Easier to smuggle and share, harsher on the liver.

### FPS Game Effects

- **Anabolic Steroids – Bulked Up**
  - **Activation**: Not a one‑shot buff; represented as a **long‑term character mod** or special mode.  
  - **Persistent positive effects**:
    - Increased **max health** or **damage resistance** to blunt/melee damage.  
    - Improved **melee damage** and **heavy weapon handling** (faster aim with LMGs, less stamina drain from armor).  
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Slight penalty to **fine motor control** with very delicate or long‑range weapons (sniper rifles).  
    - Occasional **rage events** under stress: brief uncontrollable melee lunge or shouted taunt revealing position.  
    - If abused heavily, possible story event: **health complications** (heart issues, liver problems) reducing stamina or max health later in the game.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **Anabolic Steroids – Cycles and Side Effects**
  - **During a cycle (weeks to months of in‑game time)**:
    - Bonus to **Strength‑based checks**, melee damage, and some **endurance** tests.  
    - Bonus on intimidating physical presence: easier to bully or impress through sheer size.  
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalty on **subtle social interactions** (people read the character as volatile, intimidating, or off).  
    - Increased chance of **rage outbursts**: Willpower checks in high‑tension scenes; failure can mean shouting, overreacting, or violence.  
    - Long‑term health costs:
      - GM can slowly apply penalties or risks to **Cardio/Constitution‑style** attributes.  
      - Medical tests or scenes may reveal **organ damage**, giving plot hooks, blackmail material, or forced downtime.
  - **Setting role**:
    - Fit naturally into **biker gangs, bouncers, strip‑club security, and paramilitary factions**, giving them a bulky, dangerous edge.  
    - Black‑market steroid supply connects gyms, clinics, and organized crime, providing quieter but meaningful criminal networks alongside street drugs.
