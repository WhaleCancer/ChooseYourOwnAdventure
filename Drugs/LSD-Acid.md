## LSD (Acid)

### Overview

LSD is the iconic **psychedelic** that lingers from the 1960s counterculture into the 1980s art, music, and club scenes. It is more associated with **altered perception** than with street violence, but in a crime‑ridden city it appears at concerts, in artist lofts, occult bookstores, and in the pockets of adventurous college kids and bohemian hangers‑on.

### Street Forms

- **Blotter tabs**: Small decorated paper squares dosed with LSD, slipped under the tongue.  
- **Liquid drops or sugar cubes**: Less common but possible, requiring careful dosing.

### FPS Game Effects

- **LSD – Warped Perception**
  - **Activation**: Best as a narrative or “challenge mode” item rather than a pure power buff.  
  - **Duration**: Long; entire level or extended segment.  
  - **Possible positive effects**:
    - Brief **bullet‑time flashes** when danger appears, as if precognition or heightened pattern detection.  
    - Enemies and objects may gain **color glows** or outlines, slightly aiding in spotting threats.  
  - **Negative effects / risks**:
    - Heavily altered **visuals**: trails, color shifts, breathing walls; can obscure enemies and hazards.  
    - Misleading **audio cues** and occasional hallucinated enemies or doors.  
    - Controls may feel slightly **floaty or delayed**, increasing challenge.  
    - If the player is under heavy fire or low health, the game can trigger intense **bad‑trip visuals**—distortion, whispering, and aggressive imagery.

### Tabletop PnP RPG Effects

- **LSD – Expanded and Unreliable Senses**
  - **Possible benefits**:
    - Bonus to **creative problem‑solving**, lateral thinking, or abstract puzzles when the character can relax and focus.  
    - Occasional GM‑granted “insight flashes” about symbolism, hidden patterns, or occult clues.  
  - **Costs / drawbacks**:
    - Penalties to **routine physical tasks** (driving, shooting, stealth) unless the character is unusually experienced with tripping.  
    - Penalties to **timekeeping**, **distance estimation**, and **reading subtle social cues** (is that smile friendly or predatory?).  
    - In high‑stress scenes, require **Willpower checks**:
      - Failure can trigger a **bad trip**: hallucinations, panic, or freezing up.  
      - Critical failure may lead to fleeing, attacking imagined threats, or becoming catatonic.
  - **Use in occult or weird plots**:
    - LSD can be used by cults or occult groups to “open minds” to rituals.  
    - The GM can decide whether visions are purely psychological or hint at real supernatural forces, making the drug a bridge to stranger parts of the setting.
