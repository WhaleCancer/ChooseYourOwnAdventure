## Overview

There are only a few inhuman races who follow the path of Good; the most important are the [Elves](Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md), whom we shall come to in a while, and the Dwarfs.

You already know of the creation of the Dwarf race by Throff, the earth goddess, after she had seen [Logaan the Trickster](../The-Neutral-Forces/Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) create Man. Dwarfs are dour people and you would not, perhaps, associate them with deep religious feeling, but they worship the earth goddess with an intensity which is surprising. In every Dwarf settlement you will find a small shrine to the goddess – whom they know as Kerillim, the Earth Mother – decorated with precious gems and more gold than you are likely to see in many years. In the Dwarf capital of Fangthane, they have built a cathedral to her way up near the peak of the mountain inside which most of the city resides. It is a place of unearthly beauty, which shows off the exquisite skills of the Dwarfs when working with stone and precious metals.

Kerillim is always depicted by the Dwarfs as a tall, benignly smiling and very beautiful figure, dressed in flowing light-brown robes and with an undying flame burning from the palm of her outstretched palm. This flame symbolizes, it is said, the spirit of the Dwarfs, which was breathed into them by the goddess, and which will never diminish in their hearts. When they die, the Dwarfs believe the fire from their souls rises to the heavens, where their spirits dwell with their goddess in a land of gold and gems.

## Dwarf Religion

Alongside Kerillim, the Dwarfs worship a great pantheon of lesser gods and goddesses, and many demigods and legendary heroes who are believed to inhabit the heavens while always keeping a benevolent eye cast earthwards over their relations. The gods include Verlang, patron of metal-workers, who they know as Dfirevendil, and Filash, god of fire, who they call Akkalladfm and know as the husband of Kerillim. There are hundreds of minor gods too: each clan of Dwarfs has its own patron, as does each guild of miners, metal-workers and warriors within a tribe. Among their heroes, the Dwarfs count a great many warriors and miners, but above all shines the name of Hangahar Goldseeker.

## Hangahar Goldseeker, Founder of Fangthane

Way back at the beginning of civilization on Titan, Hangahar Goldseeker was chief of a small tribe of Dwarfs who dwelt on the fringes of the northernmost range of mountains called the Kaiakilr (now the Freezeblood Mountains of north-east [Allansia](../The-World-of-Titan/Allansia-Land-of-Danger.md), which was still joined to the other lands in those days). He acquired his surname because of an unerring nose for finding the richest seams of gold. He would be walking through the hills, not doing anything in particular, when he would suddenly stop, sniff a little, and then point to the ground saying, 'There's gold down there, lots of it!' He was also a great explorer, and helped map most of the mountains as far north as the icy plateau beyond them.

It was while he was taking part in his final mapping expedition that he found the place which would change the lives of all Dwarfs. He had been travelling for three months in the roughest territory, dogged all the way by skirmishes with bands of local [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md), which had slowly depleted his band, who now numbered only seven. They were determined to reach the coast, where they thought they could defend themselves from the Orcs, and which they knew had to be near, and they kept pushing ever forward, even though they were dropping from exhaustion. As they passed through a deep gully, they caught a glimpse of an inlet of the sea, which is now known as Jarlhof Bay to us humans, but which the Dwarfs have always called Grinderthull, the Welcome Waters.

Just as the Dwarfs were cheering at the sight, however, a screaming pack of Orcs burst from the rocks at the top of the gully and tore down towards them, firing arrows and wielding axes and knives above their scrawny heads. The Dwarfs turned to stand their ground, but Hangahar shouted for them to run. The warriors hesitated, for Dwarfs do not flee from Orcs, even when they are outnumbered fifty to one as they were here; but their chief called again, and they obeyed him. The party of Dwarfs scuttled down the gully and out of the far end into a clearing which led down to the shore – and stopped in amazement! There, in the distance, was the most beautiful sight a Dwarf could ever behold. At the far end of the craggy bay, a mountain loomed from the foothills, its summit glowing dully in the wan light. It was what Dwarf legends had always insisted existed – a mountain capped with pure gold – and the Dwarfs had found it!

They turned with a start as several dozen of the leading Orcs emerged from the end of the gully, and made ready with their battle-axes. But the Orcs looked beyond the Dwarfs, with alarm on their faces, then fell to their feet and wailed – as if the mountain were some kind of god! The Dwarfs seized the opportunity and quickly made good their escape. Hangahar and his companions returned to their distant village, but almost immediately set out again, this time making straight for the coast and sailing around it and into the bay, taking the entire village with them! Hangahar and his people settled around the mountain and, despite the rabid attentions of the local Orcs, who were angered beyond endurance by the 'desecration' of their mountain-god, began to construct their city inside it – the city that would one day become Fangthane, spiritual home of all Dwarf peoples.

## Dwarfs Today

As we write, in 284 AC, Dwarfs are quite common visitors to human habitations in many areas, especially northern [Allansia](../The-World-of-Titan/Allansia-Land-of-Danger.md). Indeed, in the centre of old Allansia there lies the Dwarf town of Stonebridge, a regular stopping-point for many adventurers and merchants as they cross the Pagan Plains and travel up the Red River. Dwarfs themselves are leaving lives of mining and exploration behind them and becoming adventurers too. The names of Dwarfs such as Bigleg, Stubb Axecleaver and Morri Silverheart are known to many of those who wander the northern lands in search of adventure.

Stonebridge welcomes adventurers and others who fight for the cause of Good, for the town is regularly assailed by local tribes of [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) and [Hill Trolls](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md), who seem intent on capturing the town's most prized possession (after the diamond mines which lie behind the town) – the magical war-hammer belonging to its ruler, King Gillibran. Gillibran's famous hammer has served as the standard for the Dwarfs of the town, who rally around to defend it whenever they are attacked. The hammer is magical, for once it is thrown at an opponent it will strike and then return directly to the hand of the wielder! The Forces of Evil would very much like to obtain the war-hammer, for its loss would demoralize the Dwarfs, who are the only beings which stand between the Orcs and Hill Trolls and the rich pickings of settled Allansia, even as far as Port Blacksand on the coast.

In other lands too, Dwarfs fight against Evil alongside adventurers and heroes. They are also surprisingly good sailors, who take to the oceans in their immense wooden ships as they search for distant islands where they hope to find the gold and gems they desire so much. Their men-of-war regularly patrol the coasts and escort the galleys which carry their gems and precious metals to distant cities for trading, on the look-out for pirates and privateers who would rob them of their rich cargo.

## Dwarf Pleasures

Dwarfs are simple creatures at heart, though they pursue their pleasures in a very sophisticated manner. Above all things, they love the treasures of the earth – gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, rubies and so on. More correctly, they do not love them – they lust after them. Many Dwarfs can almost sniff them out, wherever they are hidden in the earth, so keenly attuned are they to these things. But when they have them, they become afraid, for they fear that other creatures will try to take them away from them again. So they hide their precious jewels away in vaults, behind large stone doors with enormous locks, and they guard them devotedly.

Apart from this paranoid flaw in their characters, however, Dwarfs are quite admirable. They are hardy warriors, and though they do not like to kill, they look on battlegrounds as places where they can prove themselves in the eyes of their fellows. The other good thing about battles, of course, is that they are often an excellent source of tales and songs. Dwarfs love rousing songs and stories, especially if they are accompanied by a flagon or three of strong ale, and a pipeful of tobacco.

Dwarf ale is very, very strong, but will not harm humans who drink it in moderation, unlike the Orc ale Guursh. They also distil a number of special spirits, including the infamous Skullbuster spirit, but these are very much an acquired taste, and are also very expensive unless you are drinking in a Dwarf tavern. Dwarfs love a good pipe of smoking-weed or tobacco to help their conversation flow. They usually trade for it with humans, who in turn acquire it from the southern lands where it is grown. Famous Dwarf brands include Gurny's Leaf, Pure Axehead and Dragon Smoke.

Even when they are relaxing, however, Dwarfs will always keep their weapons close by, for they know that sooner or later [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) and [Trolls](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md) will assail them again. Life for a Dwarf seems to be one long round of fighting, drinking and prospecting down a mine – but you would never hear a Dwarf complain about it!

## Dwarf Weapons

The weapons Dwarfs use are large and bulky compared to those of humans, but they are manufactured with a precision which no human weapon-maker could match. They are always cast in the finest steel, and are decorated with Dwarf runes. Their weapons have developed from the tools they use underground, and include hammers, picks and axes. Their mail armour is famous the world over for being light, but very hard and able to protect one from the hardest blows.

## Dwarf Runes

Dwarf writing consists of runes, simple letters developed because they are easy to chisel into stone. They do not use punctuation, but mark new sentences with a larger capital rune. Dwarf runes spell everything as it sounds, rather than as it is normally spelt. 'Cat' is really 'kat'; 'pick' is really 'pikh'; 'caught' is 'kőt' and so on. The rune for D is often used as the symbol for the Dwarf race as a whole, and is known as the Dwarf Rune.
