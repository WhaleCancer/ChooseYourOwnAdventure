## Overview

The other main race of good creatures could not be more different from [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md). The Elves of Titan are the epitome of beauty and grace and intelligence, and believe strongly in the power of magic and the strength of peace. It is often difficult for humans to understand Elves, for their culture is so far removed from ours, and these differences have caused the Elves to be misunderstood in the past. The blemish of their [Dark Elf](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md) relations aside, Wood Elves and Mountain Elves are probably the purest servants of the Forces for Good there are.

## The Elven Gods

As you know, the Elves believe they were created by [Galana](The-Gods-of-Good.md#galana), the plant goddess, at the same time as Throff created the [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) and Titan created the Giants, in imitation of the men which had been made by [Logaan the Trickster](../The-Neutral-Forces/Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md). Galana, who is known by the name Erillia, or just Elf Mother, is still worshipped by all good Elves, who revere her with an intensity that surpasses even that with which the Dwarfs worship the earth goddess Kerillim (Throff, known as Elluviel to the Elves). All Elven forests are dotted with shrines to Erillia, where Elves will stop and keep silent for a few moments as they pass. The goddess is never portrayed by Elves, who consider that no statue would be able to capture the true unearthly beauty of their goddess, but they describe her as being fairer than anything on Titan, with silvery skin and long, flowing, white hair; she also has the delicately pointed ears and deep-green eyes of the Elves. She is the Elven ideal of beauty, and any Elf woman who shares similar characteristics is admired by all Elves.

Elves also worship a number of lesser deities, who are known as the Children of Erillia, though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than fact. They include Argowen, god of trees; Aegraven, goddess of flowers; and Istarel, god of forest creatures. They also know and give offerings to Hamaskis, god of learning, whom they name Livurien the Sorcerer, and his companion, the demigod and Elf hero from prehistory known only as the White Lord (Tea Oriens in High Elvish). Some animal gods may also receive prayers and offerings. In his or her natural forest habitat, an Elf's day will be full of small rituals and prayers to many gods and deities; such practices keep them at peace and at one with their surroundings in a way similar to the 'meditations' of a mystic or sorcerer before casting a spell.

## A Long, Long Life

One of the things that influence Elven attitudes to other races is their longevity. Barring accidents or death at the hands of others, most Elves live for between two hundred and two hundred and fifty years (and this in an age when most humans do not reach their fiftieth birthday, what with one thing and another), and they rarely show their age. In an Elf's lifetime a city could be founded as a village, rise to statehood and collapse again; generations of humans would come and go – and seemingly changeless, the Elf would witness all of it.

Time, therefore, means very little to an Elf. There is no need to rush anything. They are cautious and forward-looking people, who see everything in terms of the future rather than of the present. In the few times of war when they have joined forces with [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) and men, they have frustrated their allies with their 'wait and-see' attitude, which is in direct contrast to the urgent need for action usually demanded by Dwarfs and humans.

Because they live for a long time, Elves have found a great many ways of passing their time. They do many things which other races would consider wastes of time: for instance, they sing songs, talk to forest creatures and take great pleasure in simply watching natural things like plants. It seems to shorter-lived beings that they do not know the value of time, but really they know it all too well – they just have a lot of it to use up as best they can.

Their longevity has also given Elves their peculiar love for life and all living things. While this is understandable when one sees the sheer beauty of the Elven groves at the heart of their forests, it is hard to comprehend how anyone could love [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) and things of Chaos. The Elves, however, seem to look upon such repulsive creatures with a very neutral attitude: they don't much care about them one way or the other – they know that they will die before they themselves have reached full adulthood.

## The Orc Wars

In the past, however, Elves have taken exception – grave exception – to [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) and other creatures of Evil and Chaos. In the years around 600 OT, twelve years after the beings which would later turn into the [Dark Elves](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md) broke away from the Elven Council and fled underground (see the section on Dark Elves later for more details of this event), the northern Elvish kingdoms of the Mountain Elves found their forests under heavy attack from large, organized armies of Orcs led by a pair of human sorcerers, the Dark Twins. In the past, Orcs had trespassed in the Elven forests, hunting and killing in indiscriminate searches for food, and had been met with brisk opposition in the form of a few well-aimed arrows which dropped the first Orcs where they stood and persuaded the rest that they were better off not staying in the forests any longer than they had to.

But this time, the Orcs came in much greater numbers, whole legions of the foul things, and they were led by people who knew what they were doing. As the front lines overran parts of the forest, other units would come up behind them and burn the trees, clearing away the beautiful greenery and leaving only sterile ash. Elvish records say that the Elves could hear the trees screaming for many leagues around. The Dark Twins were aiming to acquire some deep secrets of Elvish high magic, but they reckoned without King Glorien Thelemas, Lord of the Elven Council, who had been slow to act when the Elves of Viridel Kerithrion rebelled, but who was now spurred into action.

The Orc Wars began, with Elves harrying Orcs across much of the northern part of the one continent, losing a few battles, but winning most of them by a mixture of careful planning, skill and sheer fury at the atrocities committed by the Orcs. The inhuman armies fled, burning the trees as they went in a vain attempt to stop the vengeful armies which dogged them, but they only goaded their pursuers to greater and greater action.

The armies of the Elven nations chased the foul creatures for a year and a half, as far as the edges of the ice plateaux in the extreme north, where the sorcerers halted the remains of their once-mighty armies for a final stand. But after all his haste, Thelemas wanted to taste his vengeance slowly. The Elven armies stopped, and appeared to be waiting. In the freezing conditions, the Orcs suffered terribly, and they died in their hundreds, but the Elves – many of whom were hardy Mountain Elves – kept warm by using their magic, and by reducing their body temperatures to a state similar to hibernation for all but a few hours every day, leaving perhaps a quarter of their number on guard.

What the Elves were waiting for was the arrival of nine very powerful Elven sorcerers, who had been summoned from their retreats deep within the forests of the south. When they arrived, eventually, spring was coming to the frozen regions. The Elven armies marched north, and finally faced the evil forces. The Dark Twins were challenged to magical combat by the Elven mages, and owing to the code of all magicians they had to agree. The contest lasted only two rounds, before an awesome gout of flame issued from the ground and consumed up the Dark Twins; the Elven armies marched home, without fuss, and in silence.

## Hatred of Dark Elves

There is only one race which is really hated by Elves – the [Dark Elves](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md). The accursed creatures are opposed to everything that Wood Elves stand for – truth, light, peace and justice. Should a Dark Elf meet up with a surface Elf, they will have to fight to the death, because neither side will show any mercy whatsoever. For a good Elf to have any dealings with Dark Elves, he must betray all the principles of his people and his goddess. Even the poor Black Elves, who were originally part of Viridel Kerithrion's rebellion, will have nothing at all to do with the demonic creatures now that they have taken up the worship of the foul Demon Princes. If good Elves regarded [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) with anything like the same depth of hatred as they do their evil relations, it is likely that there would be few Orcs left to trouble anyone on Titan.

If a Wood Elf is captured by the Dark Elves – and that is not a likely occurrence, since he would fight with a suicidal fury against the foul beings – he is most likely to be sacrificed to one of their inhuman gods after much torture and abuse. During ordeals such as this, Wood Elves have a 'safety mechanism', a form of hypnosis of half-sleep that they can slip into at will by communing intently with their goddess. After a while, their bodies go into the same sort of hibernation that the Elven forces used in the last battle of the Orc Wars. While in this state, an Elf cannot speak or respond in any way, though his eyes may be open and he may remain upright. Dark Elves will not be taken alive by Wood or Mountain Elves, who will run them through even if they surrender.

## Elven Adventurers and Elven Weapons

Since the Orc Wars, the armies of the Elven nations have come together only once, and then only for the closing moments of the [War of the Wizards](../History-and-Legend/The-War-of-the-Wizards.md), though individual clans fought long and hard for many years beforehand. But there have always been Elven adventurers, wandering the wild lands alone or in the company of humans, and even (occasionally) [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md). In their desire to find things to occupy their time, Elves travel the earth, righting wrongs wherever they are able, and generally helping the cause of Good. They have a rather strange attitude to adventuring, for they are not looking for fame and fortune, having no need or desire for either; they do it simply because it is interesting! Their human and Dwarf colleagues can rarely understand such an attitude, though they quickly accept it when they realize that the Elf will not need his share of any treasure they acquire.

Elves are exceptional warriors, especially (thanks to many, many centuries of hunting in their forests) in using the Elven bows, which have become legendary. Elven bows are enchanted weapons, which seem almost 'alive'. When he fires his bow, an Elf attunes his mind to the entire action. He feels the sleekness of the shaft, the control of the flights and the power of the bowstring propelling the arrow forward. His mind merges with the act of shooting the arrow, and together they guide the arrow to its target with unfailing accuracy. Elves hit what they fire at, and if they really need to fire their bows, they will usually fire to kill. All this takes just a few seconds, and is quite astounding to watch, should you ever get the chance.

Other creatures have tried to use Elven bows – indeed, less intelligent creatures like [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) often attempt to steal them from the Elves, believing the weapons will make them truly invincible warriors. They don't realize that part of the power of Elven archery comes from within the mind of the Elf himself, and that the other part has developed slowly through a history of empathy with the trees from which the wood of their bow is made. Nevertheless, those who have seen an Elf bring down a small black speck in the distance that turned out to be an Orc will have imagined what they could do if they could use a bow like that.

Elves also use swords, usually long and thin in design, almost like fencing rapiers. As with all Elven weapons, their swords are unusually light and strong, almost as if they were not made from iron and steel. Some Elven swords have been known to be enchanted, with spells ensuring that they remain sharp and do not break traced into the flat of the blades in swirling Elven runes. They may also glow with a faint light in the presence of evil creatures, and tingle in the hand of the wielder to alert him to the presence of such danger.

One such weapon was the legendary Sword of Jeren, originally given as a gift by the Elven peoples to Prince Gethel Aranang, who ruled over a small land known as Bellisaria on the northern edge of the Plains of Bronze in [Allansia](../The-World-of-Titan/Allansia-Land-of-Danger.md), around the year 1600 OT. Prince Aranang had earned the gift by helping the local Elves in cleansing a [Dark Elf](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md) settlement from a network of deep caves in the hills on the edges of his land. It was known as the Sword of Friendship, and it was a wondrous thing to behold – sleek and golden, with many spells of warning and sharpness woven into it.

Before they were defeated, however, the witch-king of the Dark Elves cast a curse on the family of Prince Aranang, which manifested itself around the Sword of Friendship. Many who saw the sword were immediately struck with a great desire to possess it at all costs. Gethel's brother was killed by the prince himself after he had tried to steal it one dark night; courtiers and palace guardsmen met similar fates; even the ruler of a neighbouring country was killed attempting to steal the blade during a visit to Bellisaria's capital. The blade of the sword gradually turned from gleaming metal to matt-black, and the runes on its surface slowly changed from ones warning against evil to ones encouraging it. In great alarm, Prince Gethel returned the blade to the Elves, but they could not bear to approach it and commanded him to remove it from their forests immediately. The prince could think of only one course of action: he rode down to the Sea of Pearls, and threw the blade as far out as he could. But knowing the stormy waters of that stretch of coast, the sword will one day reappear, bringing its ghastly curse with it.

## Elven Settlements

The Elven peoples today are scattered far and wide across the world, and are far less numerous than they used to be. Today there are few Elven towns or cities, and most Elves live in small villages secreted in the heart of old woodland. Such villages are sometimes similar to human villages, consisting of a number of small but exquisitely worked cottages, but many more are still built in the traditional style, on wooden platforms among the tree-tops, connected to one another and the ground by rope ladders and narrow walkways. Such villages are breathtaking when first chanced upon, for it seems amazing that any beings could live their lives perched high above the ground in that manner.

However, you will chance upon an Elven village only if its inhabitants have decided that you are not a threat to it. Elves protect their villages with strong magic which obscures them and makes anyone they do not wish to enter wander around in circles, never able to find them. On the fringes of their villages, Elves post guards who keep their eyes and ears peeled for threatening creatures – though according to Elves, humans and other beings unused to woodland make so much noise that they can hear them from several leagues away, and rarely need to be warned of their approach! If you enter an Elven forest on a warm summer's evening, however, and are very careful as you creep through the undergrowth, you will hear the light voices of Elves, singing in the distance as they celebrate the joy of being alive in the beautiful forest with songs to Erillia, the moon, the stars and everything else they consider beautiful. It is rare to find such beauty alive in our savage world today; even battle-hardened adventurers such as yourself will find enchantment in the singing of the Elves.

Close to their villages, and usually within the protection of their warding spells, Elves construct shrines to their goddess: they plant groves of very young trees and bright forest flowers in her memory, and – a typical Elven practice – wrap small gold and silver ribbons around nearby branches, and sometimes set up a small six-sided plinth cut out of pure white stone and engraved with prayers to Erillia. Should you ever manage to find such a grove, you will be able to rest there a while, safe in the protection of the plant goddess herself.

Humans sometimes have difficulty understanding the ways of Elves, but that should not stop them appreciating their beauty and strength. They are powerful beings, but use such things in the service of Good rather than Evil, a factor which makes the blasphemy of the [Dark Elves](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md) even more repulsive. Despite their occasional slowness, they are an important force in holding back the powers of Evil. Should you chance to meet Wood or Mountain Elves in the course of your travels, you will soon learn the meaning of friendship, if you deserve it.

## Elven Languages

Elves speak two languages, one of which is a very watered-down version of the other. High Elvish is a very complex and courtly language, spoken by Elven nobles and other dignitaries. Prayers are usually said or sung in it. It is also the language of sorcery, and is a necessity for all serious spell-casters who wish to know more than a few explosive party-tricks, as the Elves call most human magic. Common Elvish, or Low Elvish, is the language that most Elves speak every day. It is also the language of Sprites, Pixies, Woodlings and other forest creatures. It is quite difficult to master, but you may find it useful to pick up a smattering of it; if you spend any length of time in the company of an Elf adventurer, you will learn a few key phrases just by listening to him – especially curses in combat!

## Elven Names

Elves have not one but three names, each of which serves a different function in their long lives. Firstly, they have a common name, by which they will be known most of the time, especially to other races. Such a name will not be very fancy, and may be derived from the name of a plant or tree, such as Ash, Hazel or Willow; or it may be like a nickname, such as Redswift or Hawkeye. The second name is their Elven name, by which they will be known to other members of their race. This usually consists of a first name and a family name; Redswift, for example, was known to other Elves as Larel Anorien. The third is their true name, the name by which the goddess knows them, and through which they invoke Elven magic. Elves believe that anything can be controlled if you know its true name, which is why they never reveal theirs to any other living being. It is not known what form such names take.
