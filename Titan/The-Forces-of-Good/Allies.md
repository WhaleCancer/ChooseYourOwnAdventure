## Overview

As you travel across the world of Titan in search of adventure, you will quickly come to realize that the Forces of Evil and Chaos far outweigh those of Good. Everywhere you go, humans steal from humans, [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) raid [Elves](Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md), [Trolls](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md) assail [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), evil sorcerers promise death to everyone. Members of non-human races like Dwarfs and Elves may be able to aid you, but they are few and far between, and they have their own troubles too, for Evil is vying for dominance everywhere.

But here and there, if Sindla is keeping her eye on you, you may be lucky and find a friend on the road, or someone who can offer you shelter for the night. In the more settled lands, there will always be places for you to stay in relative safety. But once you are out in the wild lands, you may be very much on your own, unless you can find a few allies. Such allies may crop up in the strangest places, and at the strangest times, for the servants of Good always have to stay one jump ahead of the enemy in such places. But allies are there, carefully working away at Evil's influence, and trying to reinstate the cause of Good in lands which had abandoned it.

## Colletus the Holy Man

In the wildest parts of Kakhabad, for example, the last person you would expect to come across would be a blind holy man, but in Xamen several adventurers have had need of the services of Colletus. He serves Throff, the earth goddess, who is also the goddess of healing – for Colletus has the power of healing disease, granted to him by his goddess for his efforts on her behalf in some of the wildest lands on Titan. Colletus wanders the perilous lands of Kakhabad, tapping every step of the way with his staff. How he avoids being waylaid and killed by the servants of Evil is astounding; it is almost as if he is so good that they cannot harm him. This was plainly not always the case, however, for Colletus was not born blind.

In his youth, he was an adventurer who saw Evil beginning to fester within the fortress of Mampang as the [Archmage](../The-Faces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Archmage.md) began to take his first tentative steps towards his ultimate goal of imposing tyranny over the whole of Kakhabad. The foul sorcerer had made pacts with [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md), [Goblins](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Goblins-The-Children-of-Evil.md) and the accursed Red-Eyes, who were then starting to raid the few settled parts of Kakhabad, intent on giving good demonstrations of the potential power of the Archmage as a warning to the leaders of other nearby nations.

Colletus, then innocent and unworldly, but full of the courage of the young, journeyed long and hard, until he came to the very gates of the Fortress of Mampang. Proclaiming that he wished to pledge his sword to the Archmage and fight with his armies, he gained entrance, and quickly began finding his way about. Eventually, after two months' exploration of every aspect of the travesty of life which goes on in that place of Evil, he put his plans into operation. He got himself picked as a special herald to the Archmage, with the job of bringing him news from the commanders of his armies as they reported from the furthest corners of the land. His chance came soon, when many of the soldiers of the fortress were repelling an attack from the Samaritans of Schinn, the Bird Man resistance who had been making quick in-and-out raids against the fortress for several months. Bursting into the Archmage's rooms, he surprised the sorcerer kneeling in communication with his foul demonic gods, and without the staff which held most of his power. The brave warrior rushed forward, his sword swinging around his head, ready to deliver the blow that would bring peace to Kakhabad again.

Colletus had reckoned without the Archmage's demonic patrons, however. Through the dimensional gate linking the sorcerer with the Internal Abyss, they sent a ball of black fire, which burst into the room with a flash which blew the Archmage across the room and blinded Colletus. The warrior stumbled from the room, pushing aside the remains of the charred door, and in panic ran without knowing where he was going. Eventually he found himself on the desolate rocky slopes which lead down from Mampang. Wandering blind, Colletus drifted through the wilderness, until he eventually found sanctuary with the Elven sorceress Fenestra. Under her care he recovered his health, though not his eyesight. He became an initiate of Throff a little while later, and was granted the power of healing through his hands by the goddess in lieu of his lost sight. Now he wanders Xamen, thwarting the Archmage by healing and preaching the word of Throff, rather than by sabotage and violence.

## Fenestra the Elven Sorceress

The sorceress Fenestra, incidentally, is a most unusual character, because she is a renegade [Black Elf](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md) who has turned her back on their evil ways and joined her powers to those of the Forces of Good. She dwells in her lonely house in the heart of the Forest of Snatta in the Baklands, where she studies the deeper mysteries of high magic and watches over the surrounding area. Surprisingly (for an Elf), she used to live with her father, also a sorcerer of some repute. He was killed by the Serpent of Water, one of the demonic Seven Serpents summoned by the Archmage to bring yet more terror to Kakhabad, and she now collects any scrap of information that she can about the infernal creatures, while plotting her revenge. She is a great source of information about all the northern Baklands, but she is wary of strangers and rarely receives visitors. Should you ever encounter her you will need to convince her of your good intentions before you can safely ask her advice.

## Other Magical Allies

It seems that your best hope of finding allies against Evil lies in magicians, for there are still some who continue to use their powers to fight for Good. You have just heard of Fenestra and Colletus who may aid you in Kakhabad; in Khul, sorcerers such as Selator the Green and the flamboyant Agravert Peltophas may be called upon for aid, though they may require some persuading. And in [Allansia](../The-World-of-Titan/Allansia-Land-of-Danger.md), there are three you may need to consult, three who at one time were all that stood between Allansia and total Chaos, but out of whom only one still practises high magic.

## The Star Pupils

In the heart of the Forest of Yore in the southern part of settled Allansia, near that seat of learning known as Salamonis (where your humble authors reside at this very moment), there is the school of the Grand Wizard of Yore. Founded over a hundred and fifty years ago by Vermithrax Moonchaser, then just an ordinary wizard, it has trained many great sorcerers, though it is unlikely to be training many more, for Moonchaser is finally nearing the end of his magically extended life. About fifty-five years ago, his classes were blessed by the presence of three star pupils: Gereth Yaztromo, the son of a priest from Salamonis; Arakor Nicodemus, whose father was a rich merchant in Fang; and Pen Ty Kora, a peculiar fellow from distant Arantis, whose father was something like 'Chief Overseer of Scriveners to the Overpriest'. Between them they amazed Moonchaser with their innate magical abilities and willingness to learn even more. Most young men who acquire a few magical spells seem to spend all their time bragging to village girls about their amazing powers, and running around the countryside scaring cattle and wasting their energies with silly pranks. But not these three! From the start they were keen and attentive, humble and respectful in the face of the Grand Wizard's far superior powers, and fully aware of the limitations of their own.

Eventually there comes a time when a master can teach his apprentices no more, and they must make their own way out into the world to put all the theories into practice. And so the three left the safety of the Forest of Yore, and set out to learn about the world, and to prove themselves master sorcerers.

## Pen Ty Kora - The Healer

Pen Ty Kora – a short, dark-skinned man who spoke with an unusual accent and who used to perform the most peculiar combinations of spells, to great effect – travelled south again, and returned home for a while, where he became an initiate of the temple of the earth goddess in Kaynlesh-Ma. There he learnt the peculiar southern healing magic, which he took to with great fervour. In time healing magic became his speciality, and as he travelled the world, heading slowly but surely back to the northlands, he became known simply as the Healer to those who came to him for cures.

### Southern Mask Magic

The Healer's peculiar skills use specially enchanted masks to draw sickness from the body of the sufferer. They work on the principle that every sickness of the body is also a sickness of the soul. Each of the masks is enchanted to react to a particular ailment, soothing the soul of the person who wears it, while the Healer casts a spell over them as a cure.

For a common injury, such as a broken leg, for example, the sufferer wears a mask in the form of a Giant, which holds back the pain while the Healer resets the bones and wraps the leg in strips of cloth soaked in healing salve. For a more serious ailment, however, there are rituals which both the Healer and the sufferer must perform, slowly working a magical cure together. The curing of a heavy curse or the healing of insanity take especially strong magic, which can sometimes damage the patient instead of helping him. Mask magic is erratic, but when it works it works well, and it is the only cure for some ailments.

## Arakor Nicodemus

Meanwhile, Nicodemus had set off into the Flatlands, which were as harsh in those days as they are now. After several years of extreme hardship, living on roots and anything he could catch, he had slowly worked his way as far as the eastern edge of the Moonstone Hills. Intending to strike north for Kaypong and the exotic city of Zengis, he began crossing the Moonstone Hills, but there he chanced upon a great evil which would eventually threaten his life. Travelling in the rolling hills, he arrived one evening in a small farming village leagues away from anywhere. The citizens were gloomy and depressed, and did not welcome him with the normal good humour of country folk.

Upon asking the reason, he discovered that a curse had come to their lands, inflicted by an evil shaman who, they said, dwelt in a cave further in the hills. Once a fortnight the shaman would come and stand on the rocky crag which overhung the village, and give them the same speech, in which he demanded that they move away from the area immediately. The citizens of the village had decided from the start that they were not going to let some petty spell-caster tell them what to do, and had refused to move. But the shaman returned with a large force of [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) and [Goblins](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Goblins-The-Children-of-Evil.md), and showed the full extent of his power. He blighted their fields, killed their animals, and made the sky so overcast that nothing would thrive.

Nicodemus was spurred into action. Taking on the form of a Man-Orc through the use of an illusion spell, he worked his way inside the caverns of the shaman, until he discovered the reason why the evil sorcerer wanted the villagers to move away. Centuries ago, long before the [War of the Wizards](../History-and-Legend/The-War-of-the-Wizards.md), a titanic battle had taken place at this point between the two Elven sorcerers and three evil human necromancers, known as the Dark Ones. The Elves had won, eventually, and the ashes of the humans were buried in the valley where the village now resided. But now the call had come down to the shaman from the evil deities which he served, to make plans for the resurrection of these important servants of theirs. The warding spells the Elves had placed on the ground where the foul sorcerers were buried were such that the spilling of blood (the usual technique for resurrection) would ruin the ashes, making resurrection impossible. For this reason the shaman was not risking an armed confrontation with the villagers, which would certainly lead to bloodshed. But now the villagers had had enough of being threatened, and of starvation and misery, and were preparing to leave the village to the shaman – though they were still very puzzled as to why he wanted it so badly, but apparently not badly enough to kill them all for it in the usual manner of the servants of Evil.

As soon as the last villagers had fled the little hamlet, the shaman's forces (including the disguised Nicodemus) moved in, and began making preparations for the resurrection of the Dark Ones. The time came, and under a moonless night sky the shaman started the long ritual which would culminate in the ashes re-forming into bodies which would then rise from the ground. There was an almost tangible feeling of Evil in the air, and Nicodemus, waiting near the front of the crowd of Orcs and Goblins, was sure that the unearthly spirits of some very evil beings were somehow present.

The shaman began his dance, wailing in a tongue Nicodemus had never heard before (the 'Demon's Voice', a language used for all dark magic). The chanting of the shaman was joined by three other voices, groaning and keening from beneath the soil! Nicodemus broke from the ranks of Orcs, waving a large jagged-bladed sword as he ran towards the shaman, who was too involved in the approaching climax of the ritual to notice. The sorcerer split him from end to end with one almighty slash of the sword, and the shaman's blood soaked the ground. Screams came howling from the ground, but slowly faded away, as Nicodemus cast a spell of purification over the bloodstained soil. The Orcs and Goblins, stunned for a moment but now galvanized into action by the demonic spirit voices screaming in their heads, streamed towards him, but carefully aimed fireballs kept them at bay long enough for him to flee the village...

### The Death Spell

A year to the day later, Nicodemus found himself exploring an ancient ruined temple in the middle of the Pagan Plains. In a crypt beneath the nave of the temple, he found a large black chest, which gave off powerful magical emanations. Perhaps it was greed for new magic, perhaps just a natural curiosity that caused him to be less cautious this time. Whatever it was, as he opened the lid of the chest, the crypt shook with demonic laughter and three smoky black shapes swirled and solidified, until in front of him stood three cowled figures, and a great aura of evil filled the crypt. The central figure spoke: 'At last, Arakor Nicodemus, we are revenged on you! You will not escape a Death spell!'

Nicodemus gazed in horror at the runes engraved on the inside of the chest's lid. The cowled figures of the Demonic Servants faded into thin air, and already the wizard could feel a sickening trembling start in his bones. Fleeing from the temple, he headed east, making for the [Dwarf](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) town of Stonebridge, where he had last heard tell of his fellow sorcerer, the Healer. If there was anyone on this world who could help him now, it must be him. The Healer was not at Stonebridge, but the Dwarfs told him that he was heading for Fang. Nicodemus borrowed a horse and galloped north across the plains, his every jolt echoed by the panicked thumping of his failing heart. After three days' hard ride, pausing only to swap his exhausted horse for a fresh one at a small farm he passed, the dying sorcerer caught up with his old colleague, as he was laying on hands in the market-square of the village of Anvil.

Pen Ty Kora took one look at his friend, now so near to death, and swore under his breath. He led the shaking Nicodemus out of the village and on to the plain. Holding his friend upright, he pointed to the glowing peak of Firetop Mountain away to the east. 'There, my friend, we will wait for the dawn,' the Healer said obscurely. After three hours of desperate struggle, the pair arrived at the foot of the mountain, and began the long, painful job of ascending to the top. When they at last reached the summit, the Healer pulled a large mask shaped like the sun from his pack, and placed it upon the head of his friend, who by now had gone a ghostly white, as Death's clammy hand began to squeeze ever stronger on his spirit. The Healer began his ritual...

At dawn, the sun rose painfully slowly, but as its rays touched his body, Nicodemus sat up and yawned, saying he had dreamt of a phoenix which carried his soul back to the land of the living. He was alive! Nicodemus had cheated the vengeance of the Dark Ones and their demonic masters.

But this time the Healer was not spared their wrath. He was struck down, within a week, with an extraordinary disabling ailment which disfigured his body and made his every movement agonizing. The Healer fled the world of men and became a recluse, hiding himself in a lonely cave on the fringes of the Icefinger Mountains. He is still there today, helping the sick and the injured, but refusing to see anyone who does not require his services. Both Nicodemus and Yaztromo have visited him, but both times he refused to see them. If you find yourself in the northern lands, and in desperate need of a healer, you can be given directions to his cave by anyone – but do not expect his aid if you do not require healing.

Nicodemus himself went on to have many more adventures, being called upon several times to thwart the plans of the servants of the Forces of Evil. Eventually, however, he tired of constantly being asked to sort out the problems of the world, and went into retirement in the decadent vermin-pit known as Port Blacksand, the City of Thieves. Why he did this we will probably never know – it is certainly unusual for such a servant of Good willingly to settle in such a den of Evil, unless there is some very good ulterior motive. Perhaps he is just keeping an eye on [Azzur](../The-Faces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Lord-Azzur-The-Tyrant-of-Blacksand.md) for Yaztromo?

## Gereth Yaztromo - Darkwood's Keeper

When he left the school of the Grand Wizard of Yore, Yaztromo initially returned home to Salamonis which, although close to his school, he had not seen in fourteen years. There he set himself up as a commercial sorcerer, selling charms and potions from his home half the time and spending the other half researching in the extensive libraries of Salamonis, which date back to long before the cataclysmic [War of the Wizards](../History-and-Legend/The-War-of-the-Wizards.md). He learnt much about the magics of other lands and other races, but eventually wander-lust took him, and he set off on his travels. Over the next few years, his wanderings took him across the whole of settled [Allansia](../The-World-of-Titan/Allansia-Land-of-Danger.md), from the border between Chiang Mai and Kaypong to the southernmost fringes of the Southern Plains, from Oyster Bay and the ruins of Balkash to Trolltooth Pass and the edge of the Flatlands.

Everywhere he travelled, he saw the cruel hand of Evil pulling the strings in the background, and he was sorely troubled, for he could see no way of ever being able to fight more than a small portion of it. For a long while he considered simply hiring a boat and setting sail for new lands, but in the end decided that this was a very cowardly thing to do. If the gods had granted him the power of sorcery, he thought, he should make the best use of it.

It was while he was reflecting on such matters that he passed by the fringes of Darkwood Forest, the wild mass of ancient woodland south of the [Dwarf](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) village of Stonebridge. It was the month of Hiding, and the cold weather was just beginning, but it was still pleasant to walk beneath the stars of dusk. As Yaztromo strolled on, his staff swinging in time with his steps, a warm mist suddenly closed in. All around him, the bizarre shapes of the trees loomed through the greyness, but Yaztromo was not afraid: he had his magic to protect him, which he would chance against any supernatural horrors the forest could set against him!

All of a sudden, however, he gave a start. Floating down the breeze came the sound of screaming – and something was burning. He ran through the tangled undergrowth of the forest for a few minutes, and came to a clearing in which a dozen or so Elven huts stood, all of which were ablaze. Dark shapes flitted between the trees, and although he had never seen them in the flesh before, he knew exactly what they were – [Dark Elves](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md)! Needing no further goading into action, Yaztromo charged into the fray, fire blazing from his staff. That night he killed eight of the ghoulish Dark Elves, and won the immediate respect and admiration of the Wood Elves of Darkwood. In the days following the attack, the sorcerer stayed with the Elves, and learnt everything he could about life in the forest. Much of it seemed idyllic to Yaztromo, not unlike the Forest of Yore of his apprentice days, and he half-considered setting up his own magic school here.

But there were great problems, and greater dangers lurking in parts of the forest. Despite its beauty, it was a perilous place for many of its inhabitants, and it really needed the protection of someone who could watch over it at all times. Yaztromo pondered upon the problems of Darkwood at length, and as his brief stay with the Wood Elves turned into six months, and then a year, he slowly came to the conclusion that he really wanted to stay there, and be the one to look after it. As soon as he had had the honesty to admit this to himself, he felt much better, and immediately visited the Dwarfs of Stonebridge to ask them to help him build a tower near the southern end of the forest. King Gillibran and his subjects were very sceptical of Yaztromo's dealings with Elves, but they liked the wizard, and thought his staying close at hand was a great idea. Work was started, and soon completed with the help of a little magic, and Yaztromo moved into his tall, white tower within the year.

He still dwells there; indeed, he rarely leaves the tower any more, except when something very serious is brewing. News is brought to him by the birds and animals of the forest, who come and tell him all that they have seen throughout the day. He also has a pet crow, called Vermithrax after the Grand Wizard, who carries messages to and from the Dwarfs of Stonebridge or the Elves of the forest. Everyone in the forest knows him, and most respect him and the strength of his magic. The Darkside Elves, however, tend to think of him only as a harmless fool, so he has been able to keep a keen eye on their movements. Indeed, he keeps regular tabs on most of what goes on in this corner of Allansia, and exchanges messages with Nicodemus in Blacksand, and with many other informants besides.

He has restarted his business selling small magical items, in an attempt to gain money to satisfy his one major vice: the old wizard loves sugared cakes, which he orders from all over when he has the money to buy them, which is not as often as he would like!

Should you ever find yourself in the area and in need of assistance, you will find his tower set just off the path at the southernmost extent of Darkwood. It is an impressive affair, built in white stone with a massive oaken door. It has a great many chambers, including an observatory and several cellars designed for magical experiments, but eccentric old Yaztromo spends most of his time in the study-cum-library, which is always overflowing with books, papers, magical paraphernalia, animals, birds and much, much more – there is barely enough room for his favourite old oak armchair!
