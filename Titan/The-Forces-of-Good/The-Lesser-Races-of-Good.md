## Overview

Apart from [Elves](Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) and [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), there are a few more inhuman races who serve the cause of Good, though it must be said that some serve it in very strange ways. They are not only lesser in importance, but they are also all smaller in size, even smaller than Dwarfs. None of them are properly organized into nations, and they do not have armies, but in their own ways they contribute to the continuation of Good on Titan, and may be able to offer you some small assistance as you travel the world.

## Gnomes - The Quiet Gardeners

Gnomes are strange, grumpy beings related to [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md). Indeed, it is thought by some scholars that at one time they actually were Dwarfs of a clan who did not wish to live in the harsh mountain regions inhabited by most Dwarfs, and who left to live in seclusion in the Elven forests. There, it is supposed, they slowly changed from their original form, becoming shorter and more wizened, and even more withdrawn than normal Dwarfs, until they were recognizable as a separate race, the Gnomes.

Whether or not this is true is difficult to say, for Gnomes are very reclusive and solitary, and have little time for the affairs of larger beings. However, in the records of the [Elves](Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) of the Forest of Yore, which we consulted over a number of points in our book, a different story is told. [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), as you know, are very wary of magic. True, they use some spells, but these are very specialized, for casting sharpness into an axe, or for searching out the purest seams of gold ore deep underground – mere cantrips compared to Elven or even human sorcery.

But one clan, the Elven records say, became fascinated by Elven high magic after seeing a demonstration of its power from Elven dignitaries visiting the celebrations for the five-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Fangthane. It seems that they wanted to know more about magic, and left the Dwarf capital to wander the world in search of its source. They found a little knowledge, but ended up shunned by the Elves; for they were still rough, unsophisticated Dwarfs. They settled in isolated parts of the forests, where they could be close to the magical powers they lusted for, and gradually evolved into Gnomes.

Whichever of these tales is correct, it is certain that Gnomes do know a little magic, and what they know they are very proficient in. They soon give demonstrations of it to anyone who approaches them, for they use it to ensure that they are not disturbed. They are solitary creatures, who seem to like nothing more than just sleeping in the sun amid the natural splendour of the Elven forests. But Elves have also seen them tending plants, trees and forest animals, using other spells and a good deal of skill. Just as Dwarfs care for their underground world with a deep intensity and reverence which humans find hard to understand, it seems that Gnomes look after the land, albeit in their own small way. As they are Nature-loving creatures, they dislike larger beings who they see as destructive vandals, and they get annoyed even by Elves, who they feel patronize and talk down to them, when they deign to talk to them at all!

## Pixies and Woodlings

Both of these forest races, which are related, seem to be descended from a mixture of humans and [Elves](Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md), though somewhere along the line they shrank! Woodlings stand about as high as [Dwarfs](Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), leading to suggestions that they are related to them, though this is extremely unlikely. Woodlings bear little physical resemblance to Dwarfs; apart from the obvious – faces, arms, legs and so on – and their height, they have little or nothing in common. It is thought that they were once humans who simply regressed and grew shorter and shorter, in the isolation of their forest homes.

Pixies are even smaller still, perhaps half the height of Woodlings. Their pointed ears, woodland habitat and happy-go-lucky attitudes to life would seem to point to some relation to Elves, though what it is is not recorded, and there are few theories to explain their resemblance to the noble race. Pixies themselves do not know much about their own history. They live very short lives (no pun intended), their life-span rarely exceeding thirty years, and they have never developed writing, so they have no records of the past history of their race. A few folk-tales seem to talk of a time when Pixies lived alongside some taller, more civilized race of beings, but they give no details, which is very infuriating to us scholars, who would prefer to know these things.

Both races live in thick woodland, building small villages of huts from wood and leaves. They are gentle gardeners, like the Gnomes, and spend much of their time tending the plants and trees of their forest homes. They are friendly towards [Elves](Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) and other forest-dwellers, but are wary of larger beings, especially humans, whom they see as destructive and dangerous. Despite their small size, they can be surprisingly fierce when defending their homes, and their knowledge of the forest and its secrets makes them valuable allies to those who can earn their trust.

## Conclusion

The lesser races of Good may be small in stature and few in number, but they each play their part in the great struggle against the Forces of Evil. Gnomes tend the land with their quiet magic, while Pixies and Woodlings guard the forests and maintain the natural balance. Though they may seem insignificant compared to the great armies of Evil, their contributions are no less important, and those who would serve the cause of Good would do well to respect and befriend these small but dedicated allies.
