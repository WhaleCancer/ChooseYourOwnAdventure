for another year. However, perhaps every ten years or so, the
ghosts of their ancestors take it upon themselves to appear in
person, whereupon the night passes in a seriously happy
ritual dance of celebration, with each reveller entwined in the
arms of ghostly forms which keep them dancing all night,
before the spirits themselves flee with the dawn. The Night
of the Ancestors helps the people rationalize the deaths of
their loved ones, and demonstrates most forcefully that life
and death are inseparable on Titan.
Children's Festival (first Highday of Warming): In many small
villages across Kakhabad and Ruddlestone, the citizens
celebrate the joys of childhood, by allowing the children to
exchange roles with all the adults for a day, and to have the
freedom of the village. Everyone over sixteen years of age
must serve the children all day, often putting up with beatings
or thoroughly ludicrous requests according to the whims of
the impish children! The children do exactly as they want for
one day, secure in the knowledge that the adults are not
permitted to get their own back the day after. It helps the
adults see what it is like to be a child for a day, and is, of
course, incredibly good fun for the younger participants!
Feast of the Waters (various days in Unlocking): Along the
banks of rivers like the Eltus in Arantis and the Tak in
southern Khul, life depends upon the regular flooding of the
farmland, when the river brings a wash of fertile soil in which
crops can flourish. Therefore, at the first sign of 'Nature's
Unlocking' (after which the month is named), the riverside-
dwellers bring out carved boats and symbolic wheat and rice
stalks, and offer prayers to their river gods for a heavy and
fruitful flood, so that they may eat over the lean winter
months to come. In some lands it is said that animals and
sometimes children are sacrificed when the water is not
forthcoming, though the truth of this barbaric practice has
never been properly determined.
New Year (last three or five days of year): Year's End is the
greatest of all festivals, and is celebrated almost universally
among the human races. It is not known whether Elves
celebrate the passing of another year; Dwarfs certainly do,
typically in one vast fit of drunkenness! Orcs and other
non-humans occasionally celebrate the New Year, usually by
sacrificing and eating a lot of other non-humans in a
debauched feast of monumental proportions!
Humans celebrate the New Year in many ways. In Khul, the
highly religious citizens of Ximoran and Buruna spend five
days in solid prayer in their temples, stopping only on the
evening of the fifth day for feasting and celebration, activities
which seem all the more jubilant because of the sombre
prayers beforehand. In Analand and Lendleland, the people
celebrate with hunting and fairs, with travelling traders
setting up in village markets to sell all kinds of exotic wares.
In Port Blacksand in Allansia, however, Lord Azzur usually
celebrates by executing several prominent citizens (and then
kindly donating their riches to the city's poor - what a
benevolent ruler!).
116   TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD


So now you know where to go, whom to make friends with,
and whom to avoid on your travels. But how do you get to
where you want to go, and what hazards will you face as you
journey around this wide world of ours? Read on and we will
tell you.
Travelling from A(llansia) to
B(addu-Bak)
In the first place, you must remember that there are few fast
methods of travel on Titan. While some wizards have
perfected crude 'Teleportation' spells which can take them
anywhere they want to go in the blink of an eye (or more
usually take them anywhere but where they wanted to go!),
and some races, such as the Mountain Elves, have access to
fast flying beasts such as Giant Eagles, most people simply
journey by foot, and as a result rarely undertake long
journeys. Apart from the desert nomads, most common
people never stray more than a day's walk from their birth-
place!
Those people who do move about, especially in the wilder
areas of Titan, are therefore quite unusual. These exceptions
to the rule can include noblemen and those in their service,
who often travel beyond their own borders to consult or
attack other leaders; merchants, who carry goods from where
they are made to where they are sold; pilgrims and scholars;
soldiers and errant mercenaries; a few specialists, such as
wandering minstrels, circuses and the like; and wandering
adventurers, thieves and outlaws. In a thickly settled part of
the world, the roads will be quite crowded with this sort of
traffic, as people move from one town to the next. In outlying
areas, you are far more likely to travel for days without
meeting anyone.
WALKING
While the use of 'Longshank's pony' is all right for short
journeys of no more than a week, no one in their right mind
would want to walk for greater distances. While it may be the
source of some esteem to become the first adventurer to walk
across the Flatlands, for example, it will take you four months,
and yon could do the journey in half the time on the back of
a horse.
However, horses are expensive, and walking does give you
a chance really to get back to nature. As you stroll along, you
can take in everything around you and enjoy the feeling of
being out in the wild. For walking any great distance you will
need a good pair of stout leather boots, and a staff made from
the smoothed branch of a hardwood tree. The boots will last
you for a long time, as long as you remember to take them
off when fording rivers, and the staff will help you stand up
when you are tired and will come in useful to push your way
through scrubland.
MOUNTED TRAVEL
Horses are the most common mount, and you can buy an
average-quality horse in most villages and towns. The best
horses in all Titan, however, come from the plains of
Lendleland, where gorgeous black and white horses run wild
on the grassy expanses. A Lendleland horse could cost as
much as 1,000 Gold Pieces, unless you capture and tame it
yourself, but it will serve you faithfully until it dies.
Most races use horses and ponies, even Orcs, who use them
for pulling ore-wagons in their mines. Most people learn to
ride a horse when they are very young, even if it is just the
farm's cart-horse, and once learnt it is not something one ever
forgets. The nomads who roam the Flatlands on their shaggy
ponies are experts at performing all kinds of tasks while on
the move, from firing a bow to sewing up holes in their tents
– all without their hands on the reins! You will not need to be
quite that proficient, but if you can swing a sword in one hand
and hold on with the other, you will do better than many
would-be highwaymen and bandits!
Another advantage of using a horse is that you can hitch it to
a cart or a travois (two long poles with a sheet of cloth slung
