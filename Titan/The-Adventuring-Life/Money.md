## Overview

Everyone needs money, in one form or another, if they are going to make their way in the world. However, in different lands what is regarded as money can take many different forms.

## Gold Pieces and Other Coinage

As you may already have gathered, the standard unit of currency in most civilized human areas is the Gold Piece. Due to the efforts of traders and merchants, their size and weight has been made much the same across the world. They are circular coins (though in some lands they may be square or octagonal, or have a hole through the centre), typically between four and six centimetres across, and weighing eighty or ninety grams. Depending on the part of the world they are found in, Gold Pieces may be decorated with embossed pictures of local kings or gods or even popular heroes, though most are rubbed almost smooth after having passed through the hands of so many people. Some conniving metal-smelters cast their own gold coins, mixing lead or brass with the more precious gold to make the latter stretch further. The penalty for such counterfeiting is typically execution (usually by a particularly unpleasant method, such as pouring hot lead into the ears). In some lands Gold Pieces are given nicknames, such as Kings, Regals, Sovereigns or Suns, or after a popular version of the name of the local ruler (coins in Kaypong, for example, are known as 'Coggies', after the city's ruler, Baron Kognoy).

A single Gold Piece would typically buy you one night's stay in an average-quality inn, or a new dagger, in a busy city, though quite considerably less in an isolated area which is served only by the infrequent caravans of swindling merchants (see later for more details of typical prices). But what happens if you want to buy just an apple or a loaf of bread, or any other small item which obviously costs less than a Gold Piece? In a few countries, smaller Gold Pieces, perhaps half or quarter the size of a standard piece, have been minted; these are sometimes known as Princes or Half-Regals. In other lands, they use Silver Pieces of much the same size as a Gold Piece. These are typically exchanged at a rate of ten Silver Pieces to one Gold Piece (though some Orc tribes use much larger Silver Pieces equal to a single Gold Piece, along with their more usual crude lead and bronze coins). Silver Pieces are typically nicknamed Silvers, Moons, Stars or Queens. In some lands, they even cut their coins into halves, quarters or eighths to give change. This tends to happen only in lands where gold is in plentiful supply, however, as all those little slivers of gold soon get lost!

In some lands, coins have not yet taken over from more traditional forms of money. Among the primitive tribes of the eastern Flatlands in central Allansia, rods of copper and bronze are used as money, exchanged in just the same way as Gold or Silver Pieces. To the subhuman Troglodytes which live beneath the Icefinger Mountains, the number of human or Dwarf bones a person possesses shows how wealthy they are; each small finger-bone may be worth a Gold Piece to them. A complete set of ribs or a skull would be a great - if rather morbid - fortune!

### Typical Coins

**Port Blacksand Gold Piece:** On the left is a typical Gold Piece. This one is from Port Blacksand, bearing the arms of the city's evil ruler, Lord Azzur, on the front and a picture of a Dragon on the reverse.

**Fangthane Gold Piece:** To the right is a slightly smaller Gold Piece minted in the Dwarf citadel of Fangthane, at the far eastern side of Allansia. It bears the crossed axes of Fangthane's ruler, King Nair:II-kill, and the Dwarf Rune on the reverse. The runic inscription reads 'Cast in sacred Fangthane - may it never fall!'

**Orc Lead Coin:** On the bottom left is a small lead coin used by Orcs and Goblins, which appears to have been stamped out of a sheet of metal, as the two sides are not properly aligned. They both show the head of some Orc chieftain, whose name seems to have been 'Scurfric'.

**Tak Silver Piece:** The final coin, bottom right, is a Silver Piece from Tak in southern Khul. It is pierced in the centre for hanging on a cord around the owner's neck - a protection against that city's zealous thieves! It shows a trading galley on one side, and some stylized silver ingots on the reverse side. Twelve of these coins are worth 1 Gold Piece.

## Bartering

In every settled land, from barren regions wandered by desert nomads to the teeming vermin pits of cities, people swap things instead of using money. Indeed, in many isolated lands, money and coins are completely unknown, and people trade only by exchanging things they do not need for items they do. This 'barter' system works at all levels, depending on the quality of the goods involved and the status of the trading parties: a top-class armourer would not accept two dozen chickens in exchange for a decorated breastplate, for example, though a fine jewel-encrusted sword would be gratefully accepted; similarly, one would not try to buy some cheese with a bag of gems or a golden holy symbol! Bear this in mind and keep a sense of proportion, and you will not get into any difficulties, no matter what you want to trade, or where you are.

## Taxes

Taxation is the heaviest burden on anyone wishing to live in a civilized area under the protection of a king or nobleman, because armies and fortifications need to be paid for - as do the luxurious trappings of a king's lifestyle! Some lands, such as the kingdoms of Anion or Analand, take only minimal taxes from their citizens, because the money gained from taxation is used sparingly and with careful thought, to maintain the upkeep of the armies and little more; in Analand, most of the king's income comes from his own trading and farming concerns, and he asks for next to no money from his devoted subjects. Many lands, however, have rulers who rely on the money gained by taxing their citizens to keep them in the style to which a ruler rapidly becomes accustomed!

In most cities, the ruling family is allowed to take as much money as they like in taxes. However, every king knows that taking too much from the citizens leads to riots and maybe even the overthrowing of the monarch, so most play it safe and rely on a few common taxes at regular times of the year.

In a large city, such as Salamon in Allansia or Ximoran in Khul, taxes are typically imposed in two ways. There is usually a standard tax on anyone passing through a city gate to trade, and on anyone bringing large amounts of money into the city - adventurers take note! Similarly, ships bringing cargo into a port may have a small tax imposed on the goods they carry, depending perhaps on their worth to the citizens of the city. City gates occasionally also carry a small tax for being opened after sundown for someone to enter or leave the city.

When harvest-time comes around in the middle of autumn, the second tax is usually imposed, this time covering all lands surrounding the city as well as its residents. On all farmers and landowners, a tax of between 10 and 15 per cent of the value of all crops and animals is imposed; in the city, the rate may be anything from 2 to 25 per cent of a man's wealth in real money (but where money is in short supply many collectors will take property just as happily!). The 'Summer's End Tax', as it is known in some lands, is resented by just about everyone, because no one likes losing any more money than they have to, obviously. It often results in a frantic dash to hide money and property from the prying eyes of the hated tax-men, or, more ludicrously, in farmers putting woolly jackets on their cattle and calling them 'sheep', because sheep are worth less than cows, and to citizens moving furniture into their neighbours' residences while they are being assessed, and then back again before the tax-collectors move next door!

For their own part, the tax-collectors use very devious means to catch the citizens out. They keep the dates of the collection secret as best they can; they set up checkpoints at all city gates to stop wealthy citizens smuggling their fortunes out of the city for the duration; they even dress in disguise and snoop around beforehand, preparing a list of everything usually present on a farm before they arrive to count it officially the week after. It can be very dangerous being a tax-collector, and many have taken to travelling under a heavily armed escort! For all these reasons, when taxation time comes around, whole countries slow down almost to a standstill, and everyone takes part in the generally good-humoured game of tax-collecting!

## Prices Across Titan

From a very early age, everyone on Titan learns the value of money. Despite the miserable citizens of Brice insisting 'Gold and all its power are the root of all that's sour!', money has a very special meaning to most people. To the rich it means another galley, another slave-girl, another fur from Vynheim or another pet Black Lion from the Plain of Bronze. But to the poor it can mean the difference between eating today or tomorrow, between sleeping in the street or in the warm, between life or death itself.

From the time he or she can talk, most children of poor or averagely moneyed families are taught to haggle. Haggling is a sophisticated form of arguing between a trader and a buyer, where they try to establish a price both of them are willing to accept. Sometimes it seems as though the rich disdain to haggle for common goods, but in fact they usually employ someone to haggle for them - and even the rich openly haggle for jewels, furs or slaves. In some lands it is a mark of great wealth and prosperity not simply to accept and pay the price a merchant first asks for his wares; in other lands it is a great insult, as merchants tend to get left feeling they should have asked for more in the first place! As you travel about the world, you will very quickly learn where to haggle and where not to haggle, where to refuse to pay what's asked and where to give in and not buy somewhere else.

Across Titan, depending upon their availability, things cost different prices. In the centre of a busy trading city such as Port Blacksand, Royal Lendle or Ximoran, even quite rare items are likely to be fairly cheap compared to the price you would have to pay if you relied on the efforts of a single merchant to get them to your isolated part of Kaypong or other remote regions.

The following list details some of the things you may need as you travel around Titan; it should help you haggle down to the right sort of prices in different parts of the world. Column A is for a large city where goods are plentiful and merchants make regular visits. Column B is for towns and villages where there is some local produce, and regular visits from a few merchants. Column C shows prices for isolated regions where there is little exotic food and only intermittent visits from a single, extremely greedy merchant!

Remember that 10 Silver Pieces (sp) = 1 Gold Piece (gp).
