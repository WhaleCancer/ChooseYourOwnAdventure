## Overview

When you are wandering through wilder parts of the world, you will initially have difficulty eating, drinking and camping, and you may be prey to any number of dangers. There are many hazards to catch the unwary or inexperienced traveller, and you will quickly learn from your mistakes – if you are not eaten, poisoned or whatever first!

## Food in the Wilderness

Food in the wilderness can be quite a problem, especially if you are in unfamiliar lands. Many travellers carry plentiful supplies of provisions with them when they set off on a journey. In Analand they prepare something called vittles, which are small pastry balls filled with dried meat. They can last for days, and although you may get bored of eating the same thing, you can at least be sure you are eating something which will not poison you.

The same, alas, cannot be said for many fruits and berries. When you are a long way from the last outpost, and your food is running low, all bright red berries look very appetizing, but you should perhaps remember that they may be bright red to warn creatures not to eat them! While succulent delights like the bomba-fruit (a red, apple-like fruit found in many warm lands) will refresh you, there are things like the bitter-sweet, which looks like a bomba-fruit but causes terrible stomach pains in humans, to catch you out. You are much safer snaring a few rabbits or a hill-fox – at least you will know what the food tastes like, even if you have to go through the stomach-turning ritual of skinning and cooking it!

## Camping and Safety

Some experts believe that when camping for the night you should light a fire, and keep it burning all through the night, to keep wild beasts away. Unfortunately, we have found that a fire may also serve to attract all the wild beasts in the area, who would otherwise have ignored you! If you have already attracted the attentions of something dangerous like a pack of wolves, however, a fire will keep them off for a while, though the hungrier they get, the braver they will get too. If you find yourself stuck in the open surrounded by a pack of wolves, it is likely that you will not be doing much sleeping that night! If you are really worried about wild animals in the night, sleep with your back to a large tree, or, better still, sleep up the tree.

## Other Dangers

There are other dangers in the wild too, but these we must skip over here: we would not want to discourage you from venturing out into the world with tales of wolves and bandits and violent death, now would we? There is one thing you should know about, however. In recent years, the yellow plague has re-established itself in a number of outlying villages in the wilder parts of Allansia and Kakhabad. While it can be cured by drinking the juice of the blimberry if spotted in time, it is often far too late by the time the victim learns he has the disease. If you enter a country village and you do not hear the chirping of birds, and dogs do not run to greet you, and children are not playing in the streets, then you should be on your guard!

## Conclusion

As you travel around the wide world of Titan, you should be careful, but not over-cautious. It can be a wild, dangerous place at times, but danger is surely what heroic adventurers like yourself thrive upon!
