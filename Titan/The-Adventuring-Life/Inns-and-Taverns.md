## Overview

So now you know about money; perhaps you would like somewhere to spend it? Well, where else but an inn or a tavern, where you can boast about your heroic adventures, meet up with other brave adventurers, and relax with a flagon or six of ale? You will also need inns, since safe places to stay in the open are rare; most sensible adventurers time their day's journey, wherever possible, to arrive in a village with an inn just as the sun sets. And while you are resting between adventures, you will certainly have need of an inn, for an active, danger-seeking hero like yourself would never settle down in one place long enough to buy a regular home – well, not for a few years anyway!

'Inn' and 'tavern' are, in fact, the names of two quite different types of drinking establishments. In a tavern, you can always get a drink, and occasionally some food and entertainment too; in an inn, you can stay the night, and maybe even stable your horse, as well as drink and eat. While you are on the road you will definitely need the services of an inn; at other times a tavern will suffice.

Both types of establishment serve many functions for the people who use them. The local alehouse is always the heart of any village, and it is here that all the men meet of an evening. Gossip and local news are exchanged, stories are told, legends are retold, and usually all in an atmosphere of great conviviality. If you find yourself in a country inn or tavern for the evening, you will more than likely find yourself asked about events in other parts of the world; for many country people, travellers such as yourself will be the only carriers of news they ever see. Gossip can be great fun to listen to, though it can sometimes turn out dangerous. In a tavern frequented by the local thieves, the last thing you want to do is get caught eavesdropping on someone planning their next 'big job'!

In any good inn there will be plenty of travellers staying the night rather than spending a risky night out in the open: highwaymen, wolves, bandits and worse are enough to persuade most people to stay indoors until sunrise! There may be adventurers like yourself, rich merchants and their entourage of bodyguards and maybe a few slaves, or pilgrims on their way to worship at some nearby holy shrine. All have their stories to tell, and any one of them can prove most entertaining. In city taverns, the clientele enjoying their drinks might range from professional people, such as scribes or slavers, militiamen or assassins, to local citizens, ruffians or even beggars. You will quickly learn that every inn or tavern has its own peculiarities, which may turn out to be entertaining or perilous. Every inn and tavern looks different too, but for simplicity's sake we have divided them up into a few types.

## Types of Establishments

### City Taverns

These are likely to be small and cramped, and often very hot and crowded by the evening. Consisting of only one, or perhaps two rooms, they may nevertheless be divided into small booths for the privacy of their customers. While personal service is not out of the question, many use the new-fangled method of buying one's own drinks at the bar rather than calling someone over to your table. The atmosphere may be rowdy and sweaty, or tense and conspiratorial, depending upon who uses the establishment, but a stranger will rarely attract much attention.

Some cities impose rather annoying opening and closing times on their taverns, in the hope that some of their citizens will do some work in the afternoons instead of sitting drinking; unfortunately, to get around the closing times many revellers drink more than they should before the tavern shuts, and spend their afternoons at their work in a very unproductive drunken state anyway! Typical city taverns include 'The Hog and Frog' in Port Blacksand, 'The Battle of Skynn' in Royal Lendle or 'The Man Upside Down' in Ximoran.

### Country Taverns

Unlike their city-based counterparts, these may be massive alehouses, built out of stone and large beams of timber, and made up of a dozen or so small chambers gathered around a central taproom, where barrels line the walls and serving-wenches fill flagons of ale to bring to your table. There is likely, especially in winter, to be a great fire in the centre of the room, and cartwheels of candles hanging from the ceiling to give plenty of light (these are also useful for swinging across the room during a punch-up!). The atmosphere is likely to be dense with smoke and the smell of soil, and the straw floor may be thick with mud by the end of the evening. In a country tavern, the arrival of a stranger may result in a sudden, highly embarrassing silence, especially if the tavern is an isolated one. We do not have any advice on how to cope with moments like this – one usually just tries to ignore it and order a drink. You should let the other drinkers see that you are just a normal human being like the rest of them ... unless, of course, you are an Orc or a Werewolf or something! Examples of typical country taverns include 'Hullgrim's Alehouse' in Anvil, 'The Bristling Bristle-Beast' in Florrin or 'The Bent Spear' in Fenmarge.

### City Inns

There are two distinct types of city inn. The first type caters for any local adventurers, professional people and others who prefer to stay in an inn rather than purchase or rent accommodation. Such inns may also be found alongside docks in harbour areas, providing temporary accommodation for ships' crews – and maybe even stringing up hammocks instead of beds and serving traditional seafarer's grog in preference to ale! These inns are typically quite small, with a single bar-room for customers and guests alike. 'The Black Lobster' in Port Blacksand is such an inn.

The second type is often found on the edge of a city, near a main gate, for it caters almost exclusively for travellers entering or leaving the city. Indeed some, such as 'The Way Inn' in Chalannabrad, are actually built into arches over one of the main thoroughfares. They usually revolve around a central courtyard, which the guest-rooms overlook. There will also be stables, and probably the services of an ostler, blacksmith or wheelwright, either on the premises or at least close by. The bar-room may be quite small, or divided into a number of small rooms, where individual parties of travellers can relax together away from other guests. Inns of this sort include 'The Wayfarer's Rest' in Khare and 'The King's Highway' in Djiretta.

### Country Inns

Out in the countryside inns are more like taverns, unless they are on very busy roads, in which case they will be much like a city inn. They will again be based around a courtyard, and have stables for travellers' horses or carriages. They may have a number of small guest-rooms, as does a city inn, but will usually also have a main drinking-room for the more local clientele. Such inns are the usual haunts of highwaymen or smugglers, and may prove to be quite perilous places if you are not careful. The best advice we can give is to go to bed as usual and not investigate any strange noises you hear in the night (unless there is someone rifling your pockets, of course!) – and always keep your sword handy, just in case. Very strange things go on in some country inns; though it must be said that there are just as many where nothing out of the ordinary ever happens. Typical country inns include 'The Hanging Party' near Silverton, 'The Great Wall' in Cantopani and 'King Gregor's Fingers' on the road south of Ximoran.

## Ale and Other Drinks

One of the most important activities which people visit taverns for is, of course, drinking. In some areas there is no choice: you drink the local ale or you do not drink at all! But in towns and larger villages things can be a little more civilized, with ales, wines and spirits from all over Titan. Some beverages are very famous across whole continents for their potency or peculiar flavours; on your travels you will find it worthwhile to sample many different types, but be warned – some drinks are a little stronger than others!

### Famous Ales and Spirits

**Holdgut's Special Blue:** A weird, blue-tinted ale found in western Allansia. Two flagons are enough to stun a large Hill Giant with a cold! It costs 4gp a flagon.

**Quillian Water:** Found only in Quill, in Brice. It looks like water, tastes like water, and three small measures will kill a man. It is usually served in tiny thimbles, around 10gp a shot!

**Buruna Catsblood:** A very light and sweet ale from Khul. Thought by most to be brewed from the water of the Catsblood River, and dyed red for effect. It is actually made by taking two dozen cats, and slowly . . . It costs 5gp a half-flagon.

**Skullbuster:** A Dwarf speciality, a deep brown spirit made from distilling wheat through cracks in granite boulders. You have to be a Dwarf to enjoy the very gritty taste, but it will put any non-Dwarf under the table in three minutes flat. It costs 2gp a shot, and is found only in north-west Allansia.

**Guursh:** Orc ale. Do not drink it, if you value the lining of your stomach!

## Other Amenities

Tavern food is usually not as bad as many make out (though sometimes, of course, it is far, far worse!). It is just that, in some parts of the world, the names of some foods sound a little strange. Our stomachs, too, would initially turn over at the thought of something like 'devilled Bristle-Beast kidneys', but in fact this is a very tasty, filling dish found in southern Kakhabad and northern Analand. If you keep an open mind, and are courteous when you casually ask what a particular dish contains (and even more courteous if the description which follows makes you want to spit it out immediately!), you will have few problems with food when you travel the world.

Many taverns have their own special brands of smoking-weed, which they sell to anyone who wishes to have a relaxing smoke after their meal or with a drink. If you bring a foreign type of tobacco into a tavern with you, do not forget that you may be expected to offer a sample to anyone who inquires after it. Whatever you do, beware any smoking-weed offered you in very hot places, such as any of the cities around the Inland Sea in Khul. If you have never tried it before, you can guarantee that the stuff will send you to sleep or make your mind go fuzzy, and you will be robbed of all your belongings in an instant. In some parts of the world, smoking can damage your health!

## Entertainment

One of the highlights of visiting any inn or tavern is the entertainment which may be found there. Regular appearances by minstrels, exotic dancers or performing animals are guaranteed to bring crowds of customers flocking to a particular hostelry for an evening, thus bringing extra profits for the innkeeper! In small village taverns the only entertainment might be one of the locals with his finger stuck in his ear yelling a few popular songs at the top of his voice, but there are sometimes visits from wandering minstrels, players or circus acts. In the larger towns or cities, and especially sea-ports, there may be entertainers from all corners of the globe. Just about any act you can imagine, and a great many you cannot, can usually be found in a vermin pit like Port Blacksand or the City of Mazes.

Also very popular in taverns and alehouses across the settled world are gambling games. There are a great many different games – every little corner of Titan seems to have its own favourite, and even when particular areas have a game in common, the rules are often different. Here are three of our favourites; we know you will find your own, whether it be in the infamous Gambling Halls of Vlada in Khare, or in some windswept little tavern hidden in the wastes of the Pagan Plains.

### Mutnblypeg

Also known as Pinfinger in some places, this is a very simple game, but requires good dexterity to be played well. All you do is take a dagger, and stab the point between the fingers of your hand as it rests on the table-top. As the stakes get higher and higher, the stabs get quicker and harder. Flowing blood indicates that the game is over!

### Knifey-Knifey

Also known as Kharean Roulette, this game is outlawed in most countries, for it invariably ends in death. Six identical daggers lie on a table; one is real while the other five have retractable blades which will do no harm. In turn, each player selects a dagger and quickly stabs himself in the chest with it. If it is a fake, it is returned to the table, shuffled together with the others, and the game continues; if it is real, death for the unfortunate player is certain. The game continues until only one player survives. This is a very exciting game to watch, but not to play (Knifey-Knifey experts are few and far between, but usually very, very rich).

### Ten-Ten

This is probably our favourite game (you will often find us playing it in our local tavern, 'The Sage and Scholar', of a lunchtime). It uses a board, covered with 64 squares, in each of which there is a number from 1 to 9. Half the squares are black, while the other half are white. Each player simply throws a dart at the board in turn. Black numbers count towards the total, but white ones are subtracted from the total. The game continues until a player hits a number which takes the score to exactly ten or minus ten, whereupon he takes the contents of the pot. This game is especially popular in Analand and Ruddlestone on the western continent, but is played in most civilized cities across Titan.

## Dangerous Drinking

Occasionally, without warning, you may suddenly find yourself in the middle of a bar full of burly warriors, all intent on bashing lumps out of one another! Bar-room brawls are especially common in rough taverns in dockland areas of evil cities such as Blacksand or the City of Mazes, and once someone wants to start one, there is precious little you can do to stop it. The best advice is to get out of the way as quickly as possible, and let the combatants sort things out between themselves. If you are unlucky enough to be caught in the middle of such a brawl, you may find yourself having to fight for your life – or at least for your dignity!
