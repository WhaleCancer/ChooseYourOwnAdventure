The coastal waters around continents and the vast oceans are teeming with life, including fish, whales, sharks, other animals, and more dangerous, intelligent, and civilized beings.

## Sea Creatures

The seas contain truly terrifying creatures, such as Giant Crabs (up to 5 meters across), and deadly predators in lakes and rivers. Sea Trolls, Sea Giants, Sea Elves, and Mermen inhabit the deeps. Sea Elves and Mermen are intelligent with highly developed civilizations, capable of training creatures, manufacturing goods, and forming societies. However, their advanced nature does not guarantee friendliness towards shipwrecked sailors or castaways, as they share character flaws with surface humans and elves.

## Ocean Dangers

The oceans themselves pose a danger, with tremendous storms and vast waves capable of destroying sturdy ships. Whirlpools and sea spouts also present unexpected threats. Reefs and shallows near the coast can sink unwary ships.

## Pirates

Even if storms and Sea Giants are avoided, pirates are a significant threat, found on almost every coast and considered possibly the worst danger on the wide seas. Prudent captains are advised to hire a fully qualified and experienced Naval Sorcerer before embarking.
