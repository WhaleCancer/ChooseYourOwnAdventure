## The Time of Gods

The creation of Titan saw the existence of numerous Gods and demi-Gods. The unleashing of Time and Death led to the subsequent creation of races, animals, and plants, with each god contributing a part. A huge battle between good and evil gods resulted in the banishment of the Evil Gods to "outer darkness" and Titan being left to "mortal races." Gods now have only an "indirect influence," with Evil Gods and [Logaan](../The-Neutral-Forces/Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) the Trickster meddling more than others.

## The Time of Heroes

A thousand-year era on the continent of Irritaria, marked by early civilizations, inventions, distinct cultures, and the "golden age of Atlantis." Magic and Religion became organized, Dwarfs dug mines, and Heroes performed deeds. However, the Demon Prince Myurr, in human form, ruled Atlantis, leading to "foul deeds." The Gods' outrage caused Atlantis to sink and Irritaria to split into three.

## The Age of Wizards

Titan's slow recovery after the cataclysm saw countries rise and fall, tribes migrate, and knowledge relearned. Nearly 2000 years later, human scholars discovered a forgotten temple where ancient sorcerer spirits taught them "high magic," reintroducing power to human kingdoms. Schools of sorcery quickly spread. Adventurers released an "unknown spawn of Chaos" from a tomb, sparking worldwide battles between Wizards/good races and orcs/goblins/trolls/Chaos creatures, culminating in the "siege of Carsepolis" where combined armies of Humans, Dwarfs, and Elves destroyed the main Chaos force, though the wars destroyed many cities and lives.

## Recent History

The destruction of Chaos signaled a new era and calendar. For 284 years, Allansia has remained an empty land, Khul's civilization clings to its edge, and the Old World is plagued by infighting. These are times of opportunity for any brave enough to try.
