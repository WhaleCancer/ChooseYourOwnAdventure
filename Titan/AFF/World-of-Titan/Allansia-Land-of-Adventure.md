Allansia is the north-western area of Titan, home to many famous and infamous adventure sites. It features vast wildernesses, majestic mountains, rugged coasts, vibrant cities, wizard towers, and ancient temples as places of mystery and danger. Some of these places are detailed below, serving as ideal starting points or potential end points for adventures.

## Major Cities and Settlements

### Fang

Fang is the Capital city of Chiang Mai and the location of the "Trial of Champions," an annual competition. It is situated on the River Kok, at the southern edge of the Icefinger Mountains, and is known as a haunt for adventurers and merchants. The city features numerous markets and Inns that cater to large trade caravans, offering a variety of goods.

### Stonebridge

Stonebridge is a Dwarven town located at the northern end of Darkwood Forest. It is ruled by King Gillibran, who possesses a magical warhammer used effectively against the local Hill Trolls, ancestral enemies of Stonebridge. The town is noted as unusual for a Dwarven settlement because it is built almost entirely above ground, though its inhabitants retain their "Dwarfish" behavior. It offers respite from the surrounding Darkwood Forest and Moonstone Hills.

### Salamonis

Salamonis is an old walled city, founded and still ruled by a monarch named King Salamon. It is situated in the southern Pagan Plains and is famous for its ancient library. The city is insular, being primarily concerned with its walls and surrounding farmlands. Despite this, it is presented as a welcome sanctuary from the wilds. Adventurers can expect a warm welcome if they can bypass the vigilant guards at the city gates, especially if they have plenty of loot to spend.

### Port Blacksand

Port Blacksand is a sprawling and famous city built upon the ruins of an older port at the mouth of the Catfish River. It is notorious as a haven for brigands, robbers, and pirates in Allansia. The city is characterized by a "heap of wooden buildings constantly on the verge of collapse," making it a dangerous place to visit. It is ruled by Lord Azzur, and while it has a form of law, the text suggests "order" might be an overstatement. The city guard is noted to include Ogres and Trolls who enjoy terrorizing the population under their "protection."

## Regions and Landmarks

### The Flatlands

A vast open plain stretching from Salamonis and the Moonstone hills to the Sea of Pearls. It is largely devoid of civilization, with its intelligent life consisting mainly of small tribes of horse nomads and gangs of orcs and goblins. Other life forms include Lions, wild horses, and large patches of Tangleweed. Despite appearing empty, the plains are not perfectly safe.

### Firetop Mountain

A solitary peak at the northern end of the Pagan plains, characterized by a luxurious growth of bright red vegetation. Local rumor suggests a large dungeon exists at its base, ruled by an evil Warlock. The area around the mountain is fairly civilized despite regular attacks from the dungeon's inhabitants. The mountain has seen several rulers over the years, all of whom have fallen victim to brave adventurers. However, evil seems to resurface quickly in its dark depths after each clearing.

### Craggen Heights

A small mountain range south of Salamonis, populated by evil creatures and goblin tribes. It is also home to Balthus Dire, a famous Warrior-Wizard. While dangerous to travel, these mountains are the sole source of a magical green metal, highly valued by Old World Sorcerers. The mountains are a difficult place to live, featuring barren moorland, treacherous valleys, or stinking marshland. Any life found there is either small and hidden or extremely dangerous.

### Darkwood Forest

An almost impenetrable forest straddling the Catfish River, home to various foul creatures. It is also rumored to house a subterranean city of foul Dark Elves, whose raiding parties are said to roam the forest at night. Paths through the forest are used by travelers who have no other alternative. Not all of these travelers emerge unscathed due to the forest's dangerous inhabitants, though some do manage to pass through relatively safely, reporting that there are also a few friendlier faces!

### Moonstone Hills

A large range of hills located east of Darkwood Forest. This wild area is inhabited by barbaric tribes, foul creatures, and occasional friendly outposts. Roads from both Stonebridge and Salamonis traverse these hills, leading towards the Flatlands to the east. The hills are described as rough, broken, barren, and windswept, supporting little more than heather and gorse, and home to very few creatures. Despite their harshness, several roads cross them, facilitating travel to lands beyond.

### Fire Island

Fire Island began as a prison colony guarded by mercenary Lizard men. These guards eventually took over the island when they were not paid, and it is now ruled by a Lizard King. The island is home to many wild creatures and vicious tribes, making it a place avoided by honest merchants and pirates. The prison camp itself occupies only a small portion of the island, with the rest comprising swamps, mountains, hills, and jungle.
