While a separate book "Titan" fully describes the world, this section offers a brief overview of its lands and peoples. Even with the "Titan" book, a Director (game master) will need to fill in some gaps.

## Allansia

Allansia is the north-western area of Titan, home to many famous and infamous adventure sites. Notable locations include the city of Blacksand, the town of Fang (known for its Trial of Champions), Firetop mountain, the magical school in the Forest of Yore, the Flatlands, and the frozen mountains of Frostholm. The diverse terrain includes mountains, deserts, forests, plains, swamps, hills, and islands. Not for nothing is Allansia known as the Land of Danger!

Allansia contains numerous towns and villages, some shown on a map, but many more are too small to be depicted. These settlements are organized into Kingdoms, Baronies, and loose associations, alongside tiny hamlets and isolated farmsteads with no clear allegiance.

Despite hints of civilization, Allansia is largely uninhabited, allowing for days of travel without encountering people, though "You may see lots of monsters though..."

For more detailed information, see [Allansia - Land of Adventure](Allansia-Land-of-Adventure.md).

## Old World

The Old World is east of Allansia, across the Ocean of Tempests and Ocean of Serpents. It is a "patchwork of Human Kingdoms," including Analand (with its huge Wall), Femphrey (with King Chalanna), and Kakhabad (with Khare, the city of traps, and an insane Archmage ruler at High Xamen). It is a continent of "high civilisation and foul monsters," currently experiencing little warfare compared to other regions.

The Old World contrasts with Allansia, being more settled and politically and culturally organized. With the exception of Kakhabad, most kingdoms are pleasant places to live. While large tracts of wilderness exist, they are "all surrounded by more civilised lands."

## Khul

The heart of Khul is the "Wastes of Chaos," a region of wild magic, dust, and ash, uninhabitable due to past battles against the armies of Chaos. The coastal areas host most human and monster habitation, with cities, ports, and small kingdoms. Khul is largely unknown to the peoples of the Old World and Allansia due to dangerous ocean crossings, and remains a "place of mystery to those who live there."

Khul's contrasts include a fertile, inhabited coast with ancient cities, great libraries, and paved roads, versus vast empty interior spaces. Travel is primarily coastal by ship. Civilization consists mainly of independent city-states and petty kingdoms.

Travel between the three continents is "long and arduous," with infrequent ships. Such a journey is a "once in a lifetime event" unless one is a "very brave sea captain."
