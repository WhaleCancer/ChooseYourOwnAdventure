## Humans

Humans are the dominant race, adaptable, skilled in various fields (crafting, scholarship, agriculture, warfare, magic), and having rapid reproduction, making them central to Titan's legends.

## Dwarfs

Dwarfs are less widespread than Humans, found in strongholds, mines, or Human cities. They are also noted for working for evil and valuing money over morals. Their solidity and strength make them a bastion against evil, though they can be slow to act.

## Elves

Elves are the rarest of the three main good races, primarily found in deep forest villages. They are rarely seen outside forests, but travel the wilderness or visit Human cities. They are depicted as serious yet flighty, enjoying feasts and merriment among their own kind, but appearing haughty and aloof to others, especially Dwarfs.

## The Other Major Races

Minor good races (Woodlings, Minimites) are in decline. Other major inhabitants include Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Lizardmen, and Snakemen. These races have primitive, fragmented civilizations and are common in less reputable settlements, with Trolls and Goblins even employed by rulers in places like Port Blacksand.

## Other Intelligent Races

Countless other intelligent creatures exist on, in, or above Titan, categorized by habitat:

- **Mountains and Skies:** Bird Men, Harpies, Life Stealers
- **Deserts:** Caarth
- **Waters and Swamps:** Fish Men, Kokomokoa, Marsh Hoppers, Mermen, Mudclaws
- **Dark Caves:** Doragars, Rat Men, Skorn, Troglodytes, Xoroa
- **Wilds/Towns:** Centaurs, Giants, Hamakai, Mantis Men, Red-Eyes, Rhinomen
- **Snowy Wastes:** Toa-Suo

## Animals and Plants

Numerous natural and magical creatures and plants exist on Titan, including prehensile plants, walking statues, undead, demons, predators, harmless balls of fur, birds, fish, and dinosaurs. Some are friendly, but many pose a threat to adventurers.
