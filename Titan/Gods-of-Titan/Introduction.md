Using this book with the Adventure Creation System
The publication of the Adventure Creation System
by Daniel Quinlan, Stuart Lloyd and Graham Bo0ley
added both a solo RPG variant to Advanced Fighting
Fantasy and plenty of adventure ideas for group
TTRPG sessions.
Below are a series of tools contained within Gods of
Titan that will enhance the use of the Adventure
Creation System as well.
The Calendar of Titan
Starting on p121, the Calendar of Titan provides you
with an accurate method of timekeeping as per the
Adventure Creation System guidelines (p26 in that
book). To obtain the most benefit from the calendar,
feel free to work through the checklist below:
• What year is it? See p109.
• If you need a random starting date, see p113 for
months.
• Roll for the chance of a random celestial event,
starting on p97. (Generally, only one celestial
event should be happening at a time.)
• Roll for the weather, using the system on pp115.
• What else do you need to start? Check the
Adventure Creation System flowchart (p432 in
that book).
• Begin your adventure!
Days of the Week
If you need a quick and easy way to measure time in
days, you can find the Wheel of the Week on p118.
Random God Generator
If you need absolutely any God whoever, for
whatever Godforsaken purpose, then you can use the
table on p22.
Random Plane Generator
If you need a random Plane of Existence within the
Macrocosmos for whatever purpose, see p140.
Priests Companion
If you want to use this book in conjunction with the
Priests Companion, see p23.
Introduction
INTRODUCTION
Gods of Titan started out as an appendix to the first
volume of Encyclopedia Arcana – containing a few
important deities not yet detailed, such as Titan or
Chronada or Lunara – to be added in as a quick bonus
extra. But it didn’t really fit, in a book that became the
treasure generation system Advanced Fighting
Fantasy needed, and so the appendix morphed into a
potential chapter, with a lot more Gods, for inclusion
in the recently published Priests Companion. But
still, the legion of known Gods added to this chapter
grew and grew and grew, and thus became a book in
its own right, that you now hold in your very own
hands: Gods of Titan! It is easily the most heavy-
metal book on Titan I have currently wri0en, and a
book that really needed to be wri0en, especially from
an archivist point of view, because there are so many
Gods out there clu0ering up the theological
landscape.
Why? How did this happen? Well, because the
Fighting Fantasy world of Titan simply had so many
Gods published in canon! Ever since Steve Jackson
wandered off to Nepal for some trekking and Sir Ian
Livingstone visited Thailand in the early 1980’s,
Fighting Fantasy gamebooks swiftly began featuring
a bewildering polytheistic diversity of deities, from
Slangg to Courga to Throff to Glantanka. The
publication of Titan in 1986 by Marc Gascoigne
documented and codified all the major Gods and
Goddesses, and subsequent gamebooks added to the
pantheon with small scraps of lore hidden here and
there among the myriad numbered paragraphs. So
then, a bright idea: why not gather all the information
on all the Gods together and create this book version
of the entire Celestial Court, an Out of the Pit but for
Gods, a list of every Deity and Demigod ever
mentioned within the entire canon of Fighting
Fantasy literature?
With every demiurge so described, any Hero or
Director can choose the exact God they want or need
for their Priest, congregation,  Temple, shrine or cult
to follow.
Some material here previously appeared in the
Advanced Fighting Fantasy rule book, in Titan, and
in Rough Guide to the Pit. It has been edited,
updated, and in some cases altered for its reprinting
here. The reason for including this previously
published material is to ensure that Gods of Titan is
the
most
complete,
current,
and
up-to-date
compendium on all the deities and Demigods of
Titan, with everything a Director or player may need
in one place! The first section of this book thus deals
with an overview of the Celestial Court and beyond;
a guide to the various major groupings of Good,
Neutral and Evil Gods.
This is followed by a section on Priests of Titan, and
their general Powers, which are common to followers
of any God. After that is the main a0raction of the
book, one hundred and thirty-two Gods of Titan
described in all their theological glory! This is
followed by chapters on the Titan calendar and its
holy days, and the many planes of the Macrocosmos.
Finally, there are the ultimate indices for both Gods
and all Priestly Powers. Phew!
May the Gods of Titan be with you and may your
Devotion never falter!
