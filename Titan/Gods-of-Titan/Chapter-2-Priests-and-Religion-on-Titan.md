Chapter 2 - Priests and Religion on Titan
CHAPTER 2 - PRIESTS AND RELIGION ON TITAN
The Gods of Titan once roamed omnipotently across
the surface of the world, reforming it as they saw fit.
However, since the wars of the Gods, they have
retreated to the heavens and left the surface of the
world to the mortal races. The Gods now pursue their
own agendas through their Priests; these are their
main agents who achieve the aims of the Gods and
recruit new worshippers.
Religion on Titan runs the whole gamut from the
animal deities who have almost no formal religion at
all, all the way to some of the major Gods who have
huge organised and coherent religions. Most of the
Gods will have Priests; some are hermits and
wandering loners, some are crusading adventurers
and others are bound to a single Temple to care for
the local people. Heroes of course are likely to be
wanderers rather than Temple Priests.
Most common people will acknowledge all Gods
whilst revering one above all others. A person will
choose their God based upon their family or
community religion. A person may choose a God
based upon what they do. A sailor worshipping the
God of the sea may well be a good idea, as is a soldier
worshipping the God of war. Priests however will
only ever worship the one God.
Priests
Priests themselves will always carry a symbol of their
religion, which they will wear prominently unless in
enemy territory where it would a0ract unwelcome,
possibly fatal, a0ention. Priests of an organised
religion will wear the appropriate robes or costume.
Between the symbol and the costume, Priests proudly
proclaim their allegiance and profession.
Priestly Heroes are unlike most other adventurers in
that they have social advantages and responsibilities.
Most Priests will generally have a higher Social Class
and will usually be able to request lodging at any
similarly aligned Temple or Priest’s home and will be
able to command a certain respect in many
communities. On the other hand, a Priest must act in
accordance with their religion and the tenets of their
God. The Director and player should agree on some
behaviours that are expected and forbidden to the
Priest, and the Hero should try to stay within those
limitations. If a Priest transgresses these limitations
badly or often, the God may withdraw the Priest’s
special Powers either temporarily or permanently.
Temples
The larger, more organised, religions base the
worship of their Gods around their Temples. Cities
may have vast impressive stone edifices to
accommodate thousands of the faithful, whilst
villages may have a small wooden building with a
hut for the Priest. Temples to nature Gods may be a
sacred grove or pool. All properly consecrated
Temples have power however and are difficult for
supernatural enemies of the God to enter. Some
Temples may even be in caves or forest groves!
Even ancient Temples to long forgo0en Gods will
have certain lingering power and should be entered
with care.
The biggest Temples will have multiple Priests,
guards, support staff, accommodation and other
services and will be a place of sanctuary for heroes
friendly to the God. Very large Temples may well
have huge investments and have both secular and
religious power. The High Priest of this type of
Temple will be a very important person indeed!
Heroes will be able to find healing and other services
at many Temples, although the Temple will expect a
donation of some form for this help if the heroes are
able to afford it.
Priestly Abilities
Each God grants his or her followers certain abilities
and Powers, to help them spread their holy word
across Titan and defeat their enemies. These Powers
in some ways resemble magical abilities, but whereas
a wizard or sorcerer speaks an incantation and makes
the appropriate gestures, a Priest merely murmurs a
prayer to his God to invoke the effects.
A Priest still requires a MAGIC Characteristic, but
unlike true magic does not need to test this to use an
ability. The total of a Priest’s MAGIC Characteristic
and their Magic-Priestly Special Skill is referred to as
their “Devotion” and is used to determine the effect
of his Powers.
A Priest simply states that their action for a particular
round is to use an ability, and it happens. In fact, the
only thing that will prevent a Priest from invoking a
power is if that Priest is so far out of favour that their
God’s favour has been withdrawn.
A Priest has no need of Magic Points either, as their
power is divine in origin. However, a Priest may only
use each of his gifted Powers once every day. If used,
a power becomes available again at midnight. In dire
circumstances a Priest may use one of his Powers for
a second time during a day but must deduct a LUCK
point to do so. No power may be used a third time
during one day (except by the use of certain Talents
or Holy items). Priestly abilities may not be avoided
by Testing for Luck unless otherwise stated.
All Priests will carry a holy symbol as evidence of
their faith and station, but contrary to popular myth,
are not absolutely required for a Priest to be able to
use their Powers. No self-respecting Priest will hide
his symbol or suffer its loss lightly. The holy symbol
is what proclaims to the world that “Here is a Priest
of …”.
Each God grants its Priests a specific power and three
common Powers. The common Powers are listed
below, and the unique Powers are listed later in the
next chapter, in the description of each God.
Salvation
A Priest may also, once in their career, call on his
Deity for Salvation. This is a last chance call, which
must be made whilst the Priest is alive, although not
necessarily conscious, and will save the Priest from
their current predicament.
This Salvation may, if the Priest desires, include his
companions. The exact form of the Salvation could
take many forms but will often be flashy to say to all
witnesses: “See My Power!” The Priest will not be
fully healed, but all who are saved will at least be
conscious. Where the Priest and his companions end
up is anybody’s guess…
In very, very rare circumstances, a God may award a
Priest an additional Salvation, and even rarer is to
offer this to a non-Priest. These will only ever happen
to the Heroes on a truly epic quest.
Play Tips
Priests can be an invaluable part of an adventuring
party, providing bonuses when a0acking enemies,
special protection, social abilities and of course
healing. The God chosen will obviously have a huge
impact on the career of the Priest as it cannot be
changed, and new Powers cannot be learned, so it is
essential that the decision is carefully considered.
Priests can be capable in a fight but can also be very
useful in civilisation due to the respect they usually
command.
Chapter 2 - Priests and Religion on Titan
General Power Descriptions
As with other derivatives from the MAGIC
Characteristic, the extent of many of the effects is
based upon the Priest’s Devotion score. This is the
total of the MAGIC Characteristic and the Magic-
Priestly Special Skill.
Both general and special Powers can both be
personalised for different Gods; thus if a Priest of
Filash, God of Fire uses the Smite power, the Priest’s
weapon will burst into flames.
Banish
This power will banish one single undead, Evil spirit
or demon from the area. The Priest and Evil being
must both make an opposed test; the Evil being uses
SKILL and the Priest using Devotion with a bonus of
+3. If the Priest wins, the being must immediately flee
the area and not return until the following sunset at
least. If the Evil being wins then the Priest has no
further power over that spirit that day, and the being
will not flee. If the result is a draw, then the contest
must be re-rolled the following A0ack Round.
Bless
This power will imbue one target with the righteous
wrath of the God, and so receive a bonus of +1 to all
dice rolls made for a number of A0ack Rounds equal
to the Priest’s Devotion score. This bonus applies to
combat rolls, spellcasting tests, SKILL tests, Damage
Rolls, Armour Rolls, and even Tests for Luck.
Bravery
This power, when used, will make all allies within a
number of metres equal to the Priest’s Devotion score
completely immune to all fear. This will include poor
morale, magical spells, creature induced  fear and
indeed anything else that would cause the Priest or
his allies to run away, and will last for the entirety of
one combat.
Commune
When used, this power allows the Priest to talk
directly to their God. The Priest addresses a question
to their Deity, and must then either sleep or meditate.
The God will provide information or guidance,
although the response will be cryptic and obtuse. The
Director must decide how much information to
provide and how much interpretation is required.
Create Food and Water
When used, this power will create plain but
nourishing food (such as bread, fruit and cooked
vegetables) and clean water. Sufficient food is created
for a number of meals for every point the Priest has in
Devotion. Suitable receptacles must be ready for the
food and water, which will only last 12 hours before
the food crumbles away to nothing.
Cure Poison and Disease
This power will not restore any STAMINA, but will
completely cure any poison or diseases in one target.
The target must be touched to allow the power to
work. This power could conceivably also be used to
cure parasites or other infestations also.
Curse
This Evil power allows the Priest to call down a
divine curse upon one target within 5 metres. The
Priest must loudly call down the curse, and the target
will lose a number of temporary STAMINA points
equal  to the Priest’s Devotion score. These points
cannot be  healed or restored by any means until the
curse is  lifted by the caster, the cursing Priest is killed
or the victim is blessed by a High Priest with a
Devotion score of at least 3 points higher than the
cursing Priest.
Heal
An almost ubiquitous power, and the one that Priests
are probably best known for, Healing is also one of
the most useful Powers. When used, the Priest must
touch one target with their hand and recite the correct
prayer. The target immediately gains a number of
STAMINA points equal to the Priest’s Devotion
score. At no point may the target’s STAMINA score
exceed its Initial value, and any excess points are
wasted. This spell will not cure poison or disease, but
will cure a STAMINA loss from such an affliction.
A Hero or other character may normally only benefit
from one Heal power every day. If a second Heal is
used on the same Hero on the same day, the Hero
must sacrifice a LUCK point in order for the power to
work as the Gods demand a sacrifice from those who
demand too much!
Ill-Luck
This power is the direct opposite of Bless and will
cause one target to suffer a -1 penalty to all rolls and
tests made by the target for a number of A0ack
Rounds equal to the Priest’s Devotion score. There is
no Test for Luck to avoid this, but this effect will be
cancelled out by a Bless power.
Incite
This power will cause one target within sight to lose
their temper and become violent. They are still
broadly in control of their actions, but will be in a
towering rage! Unlike every other Priestly power, this
one will allow the target a Test for Luck to avoid the
effects. The Director must offer guidelines to the
player, and the affected victim will not necessarily
a0ack friends, but will try and pick a fight with
someone.  This power will last for one combat (or, in
a social situation, until the Director feels that the
scene is over).
Protection
This power will protect both the Priest and their
colleagues from a specific type of enemy with
shimmering magical armour. The listing for each God
will specify which enemies the armour is effective
against.
The power can protect as many allies as the Priest has
points in his Devotion score (and the Priest will count
as one of these), and will increase the apparent
armour as described below. This increased armour
will work against physical and magical a0acks and
will last for an entire combat.

Chapter 2 - Priests and Religion on Titan
Sanctuary
This power will protect the Priest, and a stationary
area centred two metres around them from normal
threats such as rain, snow, blazing sun, hot weather,
cold weather and biting insects. This will not protect
the Priest from spells, Powers or creatures, but
otherwise will allow the Priest to survive anywhere
in relative comfort for a number of hours equal to the
Priest’s Devotion.
Shape Change
A favourite of the Animal Gods, this power allows
the Priest to change (and back) once per day into an
animal or creature appropriate to their Deity. All
clothes and equipment are included in the change,
which takes a full A0ack Round, and the Priest
retains their full intelligence. If the creature’s normal
SKILL is higher than that of the Priest, the Priest gains
a +1 bonus to their SKILL while transformed, but
always retains their own current STAMINA score.
The Priest will however gain any special non-magical
abilities such as flight, extra a0acks, armoured hide,
etc.
Smite
This power allows the Priest to do greatly increased
damage against the enemies of their God, whose type
is specified for each specific Deity. The power will last
for a number of A0ack Rounds equal to the Devotion
score of the Priest and allows the Priest to roll two
separate d6’s for damage. The results of both Damage
Rolls are applied to the target, and indeed any
bonuses to the Damage Roll are applied to both rolls.
Ward
This power will create a protected zone of 3 metres in
radius that will prevent most undead, Evil spirits and
even demons from entering. Any of these beings that
wish to enter the area or cast spells or use Powers on
those within must make an opposed roll (effectively
a combat roll) using their SKILL Characteristic
against the Devotion of the Priest, who receives a
bonus of +3. If the Evil being wins the contest, they
will no longer be inhibited by that Ward and may
enter freely.  The Ward will last for a single combat
(in a combat situation) or an hour if no actual combat
is in progress.  This allows a Priest to protect a group
against a wandering ghost for example.
Weakness
This power will drain the strength, agility and
motivation of one enemy. The Priest may impose
negative modifiers on an enemy’s SKILL, Damage
Rolls and Armour Rolls in total equal to the Priest’s
Devotion score. As an example, a Priest has a
Devotion of 7 and calls down Weakness upon an
enemy warrior. The Priest decides to modify the
warrior’s SKILL by -3, their Damage Rolls by -2 and
their Armour Rolls by -2. It is worth remembering
that SKILL may not be reduced below 1, and that
Damage and Armour Rolls cannot be modified below
1. These modifiers last for a number of A0ack Rounds
equal to the Priest’s Devotion score.
