Known variously as the Macrocosmos, or the multiverse, the many planes of existence have been the subject of much speculation and research by interested scholars and sages over the years, with the multi-volume Encyclopedia Multiversica probably being the best authority currently published. What follows is a summary of that work, a depiction of the planes of existence, based on the best information available, and, given the nature of this book, how these planes relate to the sundry Gods, demi-Gods, and other Deities of Titan.

A revolutionary depiction of the Pit, the Realm of Demons, in Ernst Kandermann's Life of Titan by the noted cartographer Stuvlux Torne (and reproduced in Rough Guide to the Pit, p7), paved the way for an understanding that heaven should reflect hell. In this case, if the Pit consists of seven major planes arrayed around a central eighth, so too should the celestial planes feature a similar planar alignment. This was further backed by the tale of Kensei the Sword-Saint, who entered a planar Hub to gather allies for the Tourney of the Planes. He described many environments encountered via mystic portals from that Hub, which seemed to correspond to a higher realm above the Earthly Plane (including Titan), to balance out the lower realm that is the Pit.

To this end, if such a planar balancing alignment is also braced by the powerful Elemental Planes, the entire system can be seen to be a sort of power source, a vast divine ba0ery with both positive and negative poles, that must be kept balanced and in alignment to maintain the stability, integrity and functionality of the overall system. If one pole begins to dominate the other to the detriment of all the other planes' existence, the system breaks down on a multiversal scale. That is why adherents of Arn, the first God, claim Arn sits outside the Macrocosmos completely, mostly quiet but occasionally tinkering with the Multiverse if things look beyond the ability of [Ashra](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ashra), [Elim](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#elim) or [Vuh](Individual-Gods/Vuh.md), or even the younger Gods and Demon Princes beneath them, to regulate.

The problem of Chaos is an unchecked process of acceleration, decay and growth happening at faster rates of mutation than they normally should due to weakening factors within the local, planar or chronal environments. Equally, stasis and stability make things morbid, frozen and sterile. Instead, balance is needed among the planes to ensure multiversal stability, and achieve constant equilibrium in the Macrocosmos.

Some sages claim the system encourages a high level of active engagement. Great heroes must strive against all odds, for they too may find themselves becoming Gods, and then, once a God, struggle anew to carve out a following, a way of life, a belief. For, say those scholars who acknowledge the cyclical nature of existence, there are no limits to what anyone should be able to achieve against everything, to the extent that one may even rise (or sink, for the Void provides balance) to become Ashra (or Elim) themselves, and then beyond that to Arn, or beyond Arn, to be a new supreme God with the seed of a new Macrocosmos to create and regulate, and so begin the cycle once more, every fruit-like Macrocosmic sphere of existence stacked in archival rows like pumpkins at a fair.

The exact demarcation between Inner and Outer Planes is often arbitrary depending on context, but generally most authorities agree the Inner Planes are the Earthly Plane, the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane, and all the others can be considered Outer Planes.

## THE INNER PLANES

The Inner Planes are those most often traversed by planar wanderers, and certainly the easiest to reach. They comprise the Earthly Plane, the Astral Plane, and the Ethereal Plane. The latter two planes are sometimes considered to be inner "extensions" of the Spirit Plane.

### The Earthly Plane

Also called the Prime Material Plane, the Earthly Plane lies at the centre of the Macrocosmos and teems with worlds bearing life in a myriad of forms. The God of life, [Vuh](Individual-Gods/Vuh.md), is believed to be here, either imbued as a divine essence into every living thing or as distant observer, on some far world out on the edges of this plane.

The main world we know of here is of course Titan, with its sun, stars and moon, but other worlds, such as Amarillia or the Ziggurat World, are also known to exist. Several Gods even dwell on Titan, including the snake Goddess [Vermistra](Individual-Gods/Vermistra.md) in the darkest jungles of southern Allansia, and [Hydana](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana) and the [Behemoth](Individual-Gods/Behemoth.md) who both live at the bo0om of the oceans. Wizardry and Sorcery are well-known magicks of this realm, using either the stuff of life itself (i.e. STAMINA!) or inherent magical energy to create arcane effects.

### The Astral Plane

The Astral Plane is the Plane of Light, of rainbows, and colour. It separates the Earthly Plane from the Celestial Planes, and while the Astral Plane may see travellers from between those two destinations, it also has its own indigenous fauna of rainbow spirits and entities of light. The Astral Plane is drawn upon when one uses the magic of light, such as illusionism or astromancy. Astral Swords are also imbued with natural magic from the plane and effective against all magical creatures.

### The Ethereal Plane

The Ethereal Plane is the gloomy Plane of Shadows, the Ghost World that demarcates the space between the Earthly Plane and the demon-haunted worlds of the Pit. Shadows and all their kin hail from here, among other strange beings. The Ethereal Plane is accessed when one uses Ethereal Oil, and magic-wise is associated with shadow magic, conjuration and necromancy.

## THE OUTER PLANES

The Outer Planes comprise the four Elemental Planes, the eight Celestial Planes, the eight planes of the Pit, the Spirit Plane, the Void, Ascension and Limbo. The Outer Planes are more difficult to reach and communicate with than the Inner Planes.

### The Elemental Planes

The four Elemental Planes are the Magical Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, and stretch from the Celestial Planes to the Pit, enclosing the Inner Planes with their walls of elemental energy. They are the home of all Elementals and their kin, and within the four major powers lie many other elemental subdivisions.

The power of the Elemental Planes is drawn upon by the magic of elementalism, and also conjuration, if summoned entities hail from these dimensions.

#### The Magical Plane of Air

The Magical Plane of Air is a place of immense space, of cloudscapes, of storms and winds, and even of floating islands and other worlds. It is bound by the Plane of Earth to the left, and the Plane of Fire to the right, and is diametrically opposed to the Plane of Water. [Hmurresh](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hmurresh), Queen of the Flies, is said to dwell here, as well as [Electron](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#electron), Lord of the storm.

#### The Magical Plane of Earth

The Magical Plane of Earth is a place of dirt, soil, stone and rock, of soaring mountains, deep chasms, endless caverns and myriad underground strata. It is bound by the Plane of Water to the left, and the Plane of Air to the right, and is diametrically opposed to the Plane of Fire. Some say the Goddess Kyrile has a palace here, carved from a single giant emerald.

#### The Magical Plane of Fire

The Magical Plane of Fire is a place of flames, heat, and smoke, of soaring columns of fire and bubbling pools of lava. It is bound by the Plane of Air to the left, and the Plane of Water to the right, and is diametrically opposed to the Plane of Earth. The God [Filash](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#filash) is thought to dwell here, in an enormous palace at the heart of the legendary Citadel of Brass.

#### ELEMENTAL RUNES

The following runes represent the magical power of the four Elemental Planes and their associated deities. They are considered potent runes by elementalists.

- **Air:** [Pangara](Individual-Gods/Pangara.md)
- **Earth:** [Throff](Individual-Gods/Throff.md)
- **Fire:** [Filash](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#filash)
- **Water:** [Hydana](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana)

#### The Magical Plane of Water

The Magical Plane of Water is a place of endless seas, oceans and abyssal depths, of coral reefs and clouds of vapour. It is bound by the Plane of Fire to the left, and the Plane of Earth to the right, and is diametrically opposed to the Plane of Air. Lord Whale is said to patrol this plane, in endless pursuit of the [Sea Monster](Individual-Gods/Sea-Monster.md) God that he never seems to catch.

### The Celestial Planes

The Celestial Planes are a cluster of dimensions that exist at the upper end of the Macrocosmos, above the Astral Plane, and supported by the four Elemental Planes. A large majority of the Gods dwell among these planes, especially those of a Goodly or Neutral persuasion. Priestly Powers, the Rituals of arcane magic, and conjuration, are types of magic associated with these planes. The Celestial Planes are split into a further eight sub-planes, as follows:

- **The Pinnacles of Ultimate Height:** This plane is comprised of thousands of tall thin pinnacles of rock, towering high in a yellow sky. An orange sun burns overhead and the ground is a land of dark reddish vegetation.

- **The Elder Plains:** This is a breathtaking vista, a grassy plain studded with low hills and copses, stretching away endlessly in all directions under a bright blue sky, with the freshest, purest air ever breathed. Strange and ancient creatures dwell here that are not found elsewhere; rumour holds the portals of Evil constructed by the Brain Slayers sometimes lead covertly to this plane.

- **The Mountains of Ineffable Holiness:** This is a range of incredibly tall mountain peaks and plateaus, where the weather can change quickly from crisp clear days to windy storms in an instant. Holy creatures such as the Ki-Rin are said to dwell here.

- **The Endless Sands of Akhon:** The home of the sand God [Assamarra](Individual-Gods/Assamarra.md), this is a plane where endless sands stretch for miles of deserts and dunes, interspersed here and there with the odd oasis or seasonal creek. The sky is yellow, the sun enormous, and to step forth here is to be assailed by a terrible heat that causes beads of sweat to instantly appear upon one's forehead.

- **The Swamps of Primordial Mire:** The home of the swamp God [Vurrk](Individual-Gods/Vurrk.md), this is a great marsh that bubbles and heaves, a morass of stinking mud and thick oozing liquid. Twisted trees and plants struggle up out of the mess, alongside low hummocks of solid earth, cloaked in reeds and slime.

- **The Eternal Ocean:** This is an apparently endless stretch of sea, occasionally do0ed with islands or reefs, but more often completely devoid of features other than waves and ripples, from horizon to horizon. In the depths of this plane dwells the fish God [Ichthys](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ichthys) in the Palace of the Pearl, while at the centre of the ocean's surface rises the Eternal Tower, whose exact location at any given time flickers from plane to plane.

- **The Enchanted Wood:** This is a surprisingly and strangely quiet series of wooded glades and groves, where the air is heavy with magic. To venture off the path in the Enchanted Wood is to become lost in moments, perhaps forever. Many Elven Deities dwell here, while other Gods are known to conduct the occasional hunt through its sylvan parklands.

- **The Garden of the Gods:** This is a place of wonders, where [Throff](Individual-Gods/Throff.md) first uncovered the magical clay that was used to create the world of Titan. It is a garden of great beauty, where glowing crystals and light beams grow to the delight of the Gods, alongside more regular types of trees and plants. Many Gods live here, or wander its paths and byways. At the centre of the Garden of the Gods is the incredible many levelled edifice that is the Celestial Court, housing both the eponymous ruling council plus other groups such as the Hall of the Mind and the Animal Court.

### The Pit

The Pit is a collection of hellish realms that exist at the lower end of the Macrocosmos, below the Ethereal Plane, and supporting the four Elemental Planes. Demons and Undead dwell here in great number, as do their rulers, the [Demon Princes](Individual-Gods/The-Demon-Princes.md), except for those imprisoned or bound elsewhere, along with some minor Dark Lords. See The Rough Guide to the Pit for further details. Priestly Powers, demonology, necromancy, Chaos magic, and the conjuration of other entities are the types of magic associated with these planes. The Pit is split into a further eight sub-planes, as follows:

- **The Plane of Bile:** This is a disgusting oozing organic swampland of acidic pools and polyp forests. The Night Demon Shakor dwells here, as do the terrifying Lords of Gond.

- **The Plane of Blood:** This plane is a literal sea of blood, a bounding crimson main that extends endlessly in all directions. The Lands of the Dead are here; a continental landmass made from the bones of the damned, as is the floating palace of the Night Demon Relem.

- **The Plane of Ichor:** This is a quivering plane of fungal forests, jungles and swamps, where the flora is just as deadly as the fauna. The Demon Prince [Ishtra](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ishtra) has his fortress here, and also to be found is the original realm of nightmares – the Necrotic Wilderness of Q'Yann.

- **The Plane of Obsidian:** This is a volcanic wasteland of black glass, lava chasms, craterlands and bubbling mud pits. The palace of the Demon Prince Kalin is on this plane, as is the mysterious Castle of Black Steel.

- **The Plane of Platinum:** This is a dazzling landscape of reflective metal, ice wastes, frozen seas, and crystal shard-structures. The Night Demon Vradna lives here, guarded by a legion of one thousand Gargoyles, and also here is the legendary Plain of Ice, where Ice Demons mine for sky-blue Ice Jewels, and Bythos built his Endless Prison.

- **The Plane of Rust:** This is a desert-like wasteland of scarlet dunes made from metallic dust, of weird fungal oases, and ruined cities of corroded green bronze. The palace of the Demon Prince [Myurr](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#myurr) is here, as well as the Primal City – the free-port of Thagwar.

- **The Plane of Steel:** This is an orderly, Evil land of grids, roads, machines, mines and armies of automatons. The castle of the Snake Demon [Sith](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sith), made entirely from iron serpent scales, is here, perched upon the edge of a ravine.

- **The Plane of Pain:** This plane is a rocky place of smoking vents belching fire and brimstone, of stinking sinkholes, rugged cliffs and spiny forests; a place of bleak cruelness and blind raging hatred. The Palace of Agony is here, the great infernal castle where the Demon Princes gather to plot and plan against the forces of Good. Also here is the Voidal Sump, the immense hole at the bo0om of the Pit, that drains the Macrocosmos of waste, casting it into the emptiness of the Void.

### Ascension

This represents the Godhead, the pinnacle of Deityhood, and lies above the Celestial Planes. No one knows what is here, but it is speculated that this is where [Ashra](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ashra), the God of light, dwells.

### The Spirit Plane

The strange outer dark that is the Spirit Plane is a realm beyond the comprehension of all except those who dwell there. As would be expected, this is an eclectic bunch of indigenes, from the absolutely terrifying Ganjees to the powerful and mysterious Sorq Spirits, among those that are known to have manifested to some degree upon the Earthly Plane. Some minor Gods are thought to inhabit its trackless reaches; certainly the time God [Chronada](Individual-Gods/Chronada.md) was captured out here by [Logaan](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan) the Trickster. Magic associated with this distant nether realm includes both conjuration and necromancy. It is also perhaps worth noting that the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane are sometimes considered to be inner "extensions" of the Spirit Plane.

### The Void

The Void is the nothingness that exists outside existence, and lies below the Pit, which drains into it via the Voidal Sump on the Plane of Pain. [Elim](../Individual-Gods/Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#elim) the God of darkness is thought to dwell here, and many of the Dark Lords, the Gods of Evil and Chaos, such as [Death](Individual-Gods/Death.md), [Decay](Individual-Gods/Decay.md) and [Disease](Individual-Gods/Disease.md), were imprisoned here after the First Battle. Anyone walking into a Void Room trap or subjected to a Void Spell, will also end up here as well. Prisoners here may chance to bump into some of the other eternal prisoners of the Void, but this is unlikely as the Void is infinitely large. Since it is outside existence, there is no way a person lost in the Void can be brought back – even the Gods are powerless to intervene.

### Limbo

The realm of Limbo exists outside the Macrocosmos, even beyond the Void, but similarly connected to existence at all points. Some say this is where the first God Arn is, observing the workings of every plane of existence, the machinations of Ashra, Elim and Vuh, and the newer younger Gods and Demon Princes below them. Others state that Limbo is simply the space between worlds and to access it successfully is to access all planar travel. One notable feature of this plane is the Library in Limbo, said to be a repository of all known knowledge in the Macrocosmos, stored in an endless labyrinth of book-lined shelves.

## Contact and Travel Between Planes

Communication and movement between the various planes of the Macrocosmos has the paradox of being actually much more common that usually realised, and yet still an exceedingly rare event. Demons, Undead and Spirits do travel frequently between the Pit and the Spirit Plane to the Earthly Plane, likewise do Genies, Suma and other celestial beings descend from the Celestial Planes to the real world. Elementals of all kinds also travel or are summoned from their home planes to other dimensions.

There are other ways to access various planes. The power of Commune allows a Priest to question their chosen Deity, no ma0er what the location, while spells like Chaos Gate activate portals to other planes. Herbs such as Cunnelwort and Hurscht, when carefully prepared, have been known to to help the mind leave the body and travel to the outer planes. One of the most powerful artefacts in the Macrocosmos is the crystal sphere known as the Aleph; one need only to gaze into it to be cast across space and time to another plane completely!

There are also a myriad varieties of multidimensional planar pathways, such as the Hub, the Nexus, the Vortex and so on, but the most common is the Magical or Planar Gate. This will be a portal from one plane to another, usually two-way but sometimes not, and almost always heavily guarded. The Portal of Evil devised by the Brain Slayers is a variation of this, likewise the Void Room trap. The mage that masters the art of travelling between these different magical planes will be a mighty spellcaster indeed!
