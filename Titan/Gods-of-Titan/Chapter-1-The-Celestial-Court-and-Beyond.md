Chapter 1 - The Celestial Court and Beyond
CHAPTER 1 - THE CELESTIAL COURT AND BEYOND
They may say “Walk with Sindla as your guide” in
the wild green lands of Allansia, or “By Courga’s
grace and Fourga’s pride” in nefarious Kharé, the
Kakhabadian city-port of traps, but just who are
Sindla, Courga, and Fourga? If they are Gods, then
which Gods are they, and just what do they do? Who
are all the Gods of Titan anyway? Read on, and all
will be revealed…
When one is a heroic adventurer, one really needs to
know which Gods one can trust and which deities,
and their followers, that one needs to avoid. That
great work, Life on Titan, by the noted scholar Ernst
Kandermann, is an excellent introduction to the
Gods, myths and legends of the world of Titan. For
instance, within its pages can be found much lore
about Logaan and the nasty Troll, or Hashak and his
numerous “creations”. What, may you ask, does this
tome offer that is new? Well, the theology and
cosmology
of
Titan
are
complicated
and
controversial topics, and many competing theories
exist. What follows is one such viewpoint, informed
by various accounts of heroic adventurers from
across the world of Titan, presenting a short guide to
the groupings of the Gods.
This chapter is thus an overview of the rest of this
book, a presentation of groupings the Director or
player may find useful for ease of reference. In this
introductory section, we have information on the first
Gods of Titan, and prominent Godly events in the
historical span of time. This is followed by sections on
the Gods of Good, and the Elven and Dwarf Gods, the
Neutral Gods and the Animal Court, and the forces of
Evil and Chaos, the Dark Lords and the Demon
Princes. Lastly, we have the Random God Generator
so you can roll up a random God from the one
hundred and thirty-two deities present within this
book whenever you have need to do so.
The First Gods
Arn is widely acknowledged as the first God of Titan,
but not widely worshipped at present. Today, those
that pay Arn fealty can be found among the Isles of
the Dawn, and a few other remote places. After Arn
came the three Gods, Ashra, Elim and Vuh, the Gods
of light, darkness and life, respectively. These deities
are often considered as more background theology to
those that come after them, but some say there is
certainly a resurgence of recent Elim-worship in the
world, particularly in north-western Allansia.
RUNES OF THE FIRST GODS
Magical power is often derived from the application
of powerful runes which represent the symbolic
qualities of the force one is
trying
to
manipulate
or
unleash! They also serve as
badges of allegiance. All runes
and sigils depicted in this book
may represent the form of a
holy symbol or amulet, or be a
ta0oo upon the body of a believer, or a rune inscribed
on a weapon or shield. Rules for Rune Carving as a
magic style can be found in the Magic Companion
(p39).
Arn the First God uses the rune above, two concentric
circles around a black spot, symbolising the cosmic
wheel of existence. Both Ashra and Elim do not have
runes as such, being depicted instead by a white flag
or field for Ashra, representing
light, and a black one for Elim,
representing darkness. The
Rune of Life is used by the
God Vuh and shown below; it
symbolises a living being as
the basic unit of existence.
Godly Events and Interventions
The time between the beginning of existence and now
was marked by several major events in order of
decreasing Godly involvement. First came creation
itself, the discovery of magical clay by the Goddess
Throff in the Garden of the Gods, and the forging of
the world of Titan and all its inhabitants.
Next was the First Ba0le, the schism between Good
and Evil that allowed Time to enter the world and
begin its ageing spell on all. In the aftermath of the
First Ba0le was the Banishing, when the Dark Lords
of Evil and Chaos were exiled to the Void for their
actions. Following this was the Spli0ing of the Lands,
the Sinking of Atlantis, in which only some of the
Gods were involved, but that irrevocably altered the
surface of Titan and all those that inhabit it.
Finally, and most recently, we have the War of the
Wizards, the Great War Against Chaos, where the
Gods appear to have abandoned us entirely. And yet
the forces of Good still triumphed, which begs the
question, were we abandoned, or were we considered
ready? Lost, or independent and capable? Who can
tell? But only a fool would bet against the Gods, they
say in those haunted shadowy ports of the south
where the hint of incense wafts and intermingles on
the evening breeze with the bright haze of smoking
weed and the musky tang of freshly brewed beer. Yes,
indeed, only a fool would bet against the Gods.
THE RUNE OF GOOD
Below is depicted the Rune of Good, an arrow
signifying one purpose, one will, the path of
Goodness, as worn by Paladins and Templars.
The Gods of Good
The Gods of Good are those that fought against
Death, his brothers and the others of Evil and Chaos
during the First Ba0le. These Gods are split into two
major designations. The first is the Celestial Court
which covers the physical Gods of Titan, those that
were heavily involved in the creation and subsequent
continued existence of the world of Titan.
The second is the Hall of the Mind (or, sometimes, the
Hall of Mind), newer Gods that have risen in
prominence after the First Ba0le, to a0end to the
growing needs of kingdoms, nations, and empires.
There are also subsets. The Elves have their own
pantheon, likewise the Dwarfs, stalwart deities one
and all and always eager to offer support to the
champions of the Goodly cause.
Chapter 1 - The Celestial Court and Beyond
The Celestial Court
The Celestial Court is the name of both the most
powerful association of Gods and the place where
they gather among the Garden of the Gods in the
centre of the Celestial Planes. Prime among them of
course is Titan, father of the world itself, and of the
many races of Giants that inhabit it. Other Gods
include his wife, Glantanka, Goddess of the sun, and
their daughters, Throff the earth Goddess, and
Galana the Goddess of plants.
Further members of the Celestial Court include the
major elemental Gods, Hydana, of the oceans and
seas, Filash, of fire, and Sukh, of the storms, and
lesser elemental deities such as Pangara, God of
winds, Lorodil, God of volcanoes, Aqualis, God of
rivers and lakes, and Farigiss, God of ice and cold, as
well as Lunara, the moon God.
While a full si0ing of the Celestial Court would
include many more deities, this core group of twelve
can be considered the prime Celestial Court, and are
foremost concerned with the physical functioning of
the Earthly Plane and their believers that are
contained within (another major member of the
Celestial Court is Sindla, Goddess of luck and fate,
and sister of Titan, though she is also head of the Hall
of the Mind, dealt with below).

The Hall of the Mind
The second major grouping of the Gods of Good is
the Hall of the Mind, an association of eight deities
that are mainly concerned with emotions rather than
physical things, and they sit in judgement over the
actions of all intelligent beings. Indeed, the rise of
many such civilised beings has seen these Gods grow
greatly in stature and influence.   As such their remit
has expanded to encompass entire states, kingdoms
and empires; bizarrely a major Goddess like Libra
may be the Patron Deity of the kingdom of Analand
but virtually unknown in the lands next door that
form the vermin-pit of Kakhabad.
The leader, if there is such, of this group is Sindla,
Goddess of luck and fate and sister to Titan, father
God of the world. She has three daughters, all of
whom are also members of the Hall of the Mind:
Libra the Goddess of justice and truth, Asrel the
Goddess of beauty and love, and Usrel Goddess of
peace.
Other participants include the children of Usrel:
Courga, God of grace, and Fourga, God of pride, and
their son, Telak the Swordbearer, God of bravery and
courage. The final member is Hamaskis, God of
learning, wisdom and knowledge, though his
existence and worship are rarely acknowledged in
lands where illiteracy, superstition and folklore run
rife among the peasant populace.

Dwarf Gods
The Dwarfs have been servants of Good since their
creation at the hands of the earth Goddess Throff,
who all Dwarfs revere as Kerillîm the Earth Mother.
Other important Gods include Filash the fire God
(known as Akkalladûn), Lorodil the volcano God
(known as Kalarilekkîn), and, of course, Verlang the
metal-working and forge-God, known to the Dwarfs
as Dûrevendil. Other important Gods include Kyrile,
Goddess of gems and jewels, Throbus (known as
Berelendûin), the God of portals, and various deified
heroes, the most important of which are Dwar Frif the
Dwarf Lord, and Hangahar Goldseeker.
There are hundreds of minor Gods too: each clan of
Dwarfs has its own Patron, as does each guild of
miners, metal-workers and warriors within a tribe; a
great pantheon of lesser Gods and Goddesses, and
many Demigods and legendary heroes who are
believed to inhabit the heavens while always keeping
a benevolent eye cast earthwards over their relations.
Spaces where Dwarfs worship their Gods can vary
greatly from simple stone hearth-shrines to the
magnificent Cathedral of Kerillîm, that lies within the
heart of the holy city of Fangthane.
With all its glorious riches of gems, jewels and
precious metals on display, the cathedral truly is the
spiRitual heart of the Dwarfs, and a place all aspire to
visit during their lifetime, even if just once. For most
Dwarfs are very devout folk, and always happy to
swear an oath on the name of their Patron God or
Goddess as an example of their honesty and good
intentions.

THE DWARF RUNE
This rune is the le0er D in the runic alphabet used for
writing by the Dwarfs, and is often used as the
symbol for the Dwarf race as a whole. Thus it is also
known as the Dwarf Rune.
Chapter 1 - The Celestial Court and Beyond
Elven Gods
Similar to the Dwarfs, the Elves owe their ancestry to
a mother Deity, in this case Galana the plant
Goddess, who they know as Erillia. Erillia has at least
seven major children – other minor Gods governing
specific aspects of Elven life, including the flower
Goddess Aëgraven, the tree God Argowen, the elven
magical God Alliarien, the language God Euthillial,
the white Goddess of healing Iatro, the forest creature
God Istarel, and the reason Goddess Ititia.
Other important Elven deities include Hamaskis, in
his role as Livurien the Sorcerer, the twin brothers
Aëlf and Téla Oriens (the la0er is also known as the
White Lord for his arcane collaborations with both
Alliarien and Livurien), as Patrons of Elven warriors
and wizards respectively, and Maëlla, Goddess of the
lifeforce of all living creatures, and also of dreams
and dream magic.
In their lands, an Elf’s day will be full of small Rituals
and prayers to many Gods and deities, with such
practices keeping them at peace and at one with their
surroundings.

Close to their villages, and usually within the
protection of their warding spells, Elves construct
shrines to Erillia: they plant groves of very young
trees and bright forest flowers in her memory, and –
a typical Elven practice – wrap small gold and silver
ribbons around nearby branches, and sometimes set
up a small six-sided plinth cut out of pure white stone
and engraved with prayers to the Goddess.
These at least are the Gods and beliefs of the Half,
High, Jungle, Mountain and Wood Elves. Other races
of Goodly Elves may worship other deities, such as
Sea Elves who follow Hydana, or Desert Elves who
generally only acknowledge Erillia as the spirit of the
Whitened Tree, in tribute to the spartan terrain they
inhabit, while the possibly extinct Ice Elves were
thought to honour Farigiss, God of cold.
Good Gods of Other People
In addition to Elves and Dwarfs, it is worth
considering several other races at least partially
aligned to goodness in some form or another. Giants,
despite
numbering
many
troublesome
types,
ultimately all worship Titan as their primal Deity,
even if some of them also follow other Gods out of
necessity, such as a Sea Giant revering Hydana or a
Storm Giant supplicating Sukh.
The vulture-headed creatures known as Hamakei,
are, perhaps unsurprisingly given their name,
adherents of Hamaskis the God of knowledge and
wisdom, as are the pesky Minimites. Other, so-called
“Lesser Races” cleave to the dual worship of Galana
and Sindla, among this number would include
Gnomes, Halflings, Fairies, Sprites, Pixies, Woodlings
and some others.
Lastly, from the realm of the animals and beasts, the
Centaurs owe allegiance to both the stallion God
Hunnynhaa and their legendary hero Silvermane,
while the Felinaurs offer prayers to Rogaar in his
form
as
Kurawu
the
lion
God,
Lizardines
acknowledge Kilanirax the Dragon King, and some
clans of Bird Men, such as as the Boulyanthrop of
Kazan, pay fealty to the Hawklord. Still stranger
perhaps, are the amphibious Kreehuls of the Isles of
the Dawn, who venerate the Si0ing Prophet, a goodly
servant of the first God Arn.
New cults are always appearing. Currently on the
rise in Allansia at the moment are the Light
Worshippers, followers of Kyrile, the Dwarf Goddess
of gems and jewels. The worship of Kyrile by Dwarfs
and Skorn has risen to the surface world and been
embraced by various races including Chervah,
Gnomes and Halflings, who now call themselves
Worshippers of Light. Gods such as these, and their
followers are shown on the accompanying table.

Chapter 1 - The Celestial Court and Beyond
Neutral Gods
Between the forces of Good and Evil, there are the
Neutral Gods, of which there are two types. One
group are the followers of the Trickster Gods, led by
Logaan, creator of humans, who try to offset Good
and Evil, creating balance between the two.
The other group have pledged allegiances to one of
the Beast Lords of the Animal Court, their few
philosophies dedicated to the success of their animal
followers, preferring to remain aloof from the world
and all its problems. Both factions may give you aid,
or may hinder you terribly; accordingly, be wary of
Neutral beings.

Trickster Gods and Neutral Powers
The prime God of the Neutral faction is the God of
Tricksters, Logaan, who is generally acknowledged
as the creator-Deity of humans across Titan. His two
accomplices are Kata, the God of thieves, and Petros,
the God of shadows, and they form the main
triumvirate of the Trickster Gods.
RUNES OF THE TRICKSTERS
The Tricksters use two runes, which encapsulate the
basic principles behind their alignment. One is an
arrow pointing in both directions, symbolising the
balance of good and Evil. The other is a six-pointed
star, and, as it points in all directions, means, quite
simply, that absolutely anything can happen!
The rest are a mix of outcasts, exiles and disinterested
observers.
Some,
such
as
Osmani,
God
of
mercenaries, appear to be banished from the Garden
of the Gods. Others, such as Vlada, God of trade and
gambling, are really self-interested intermediaries
between all the other factions, or, in the case of Zorna
and Throbus, observers of the balance between Good
and Evil, and whether it is being maintained.
Beast Lords of the Animal Court
The Animal Court is the third major grouping of the
Gods within the Celestial Court, comprising the Beast
Lords, which are the individual deities for every
major collection of creatures that has existed or
currently exists.
The vast majority of these respective demiurges are
Neutral in outlook, existing only as celestial prime
examples and advocates for their existential type,
their continued existence and survival. Some may be
drawn to the ways of Good, such as the dragon God
Kilanirax, Rogaar the Golden Lion, or the Hawklord.
Others may cleave to the path of Evil and Chaos
including the many and bestial Gods like the Night
Dragon, the Manticore, the Basilisk, the Gargoyle, the
Sea Monster and the Behemoth, who some consider
the primal Chaos God. Most however, are relatively
Neutral, advocating for their animal children alone,
indifferent to the changing tides of Good or Evil.
Many are depicted on the diagram on the next page;
an extension of the original diagram of the Animal
Court that appeared in Titan (p69). It shows the
names and relations of all the major members of the
Animal Court, for to go into every animal cult in
detail would be tedious in the extreme!
Followers of Neutral Gods
Genies are the main servants of Logaan and
commonly encountered on Titan by Heroes, but he
has other followers as well, including Elvins,
Leprechauns and Wheelies. Indeed, as per the
a0ached table below, many Neutral Gods have
followers drawn from the myriad races of sentient
creatures. Most cleave to the animal type of their
parent God but there are exceptions. Warrior
creatures such as Gorians and Eyeless Archers
follower Osmani the mercenary God for example.

the Animal Court

names and relations of all
the major Beast Lords of
the Animal Court. It is an
extension of  the original
diagram of the Animal
Court that appeared in

(p69),

additional
deities. This includes the

were

the Dark Lords, all the

were represented in the

cycle
of
Titan known as the Turn,
all
the
extra
animal
deities present in the

p42-49,
and
more
besides.
Gods of Evil and Chaos
On the side of Evil and Chaos during the First Ba0le
were the brothers Death, Decay and Disease, the
original triumvirate of the Dark Lords. Alongside
them were a bewildering array of other deities,
renegade Beast Lords, outcasts from the Celestial
Planes, rogue Elemental Demigods, and the many
Demon Princes from the Pit. Some worshippers
cleave hard to the original core of deities, others
splinter off into new cults and sects.
Given this diversity it is perhaps best to consider
these Gods, however distasteful, as an initial
grouping of two major Powers, the Dark Lords, and
the Demon Princes, followed by various creature
divisions, from the multitudinous children of
Hashak, the Goblins, Orcs, Trolls and Ogres, to the
Caarth Snake People, the Lizard Men of Silur Cha, the
Dark Elves of that subterranean metropolis, Tìranduil
Kelthas, some way beneath the surface of Titan under
the noted locale of Darkwood Forest.
The Dark Lords of Evil and Chaos
Death, of course, is the first among the Dark Lords,
followed by his disgusting brethren Decay and
Disease. Other Dark Lords include renegade deities
from the Celestial Court, such as Slangg and Tanit,
the Malice, Belthegor, Dolod and Trabaten. Allies
from the Beast Lords of the Animal Court include
Almor,
Arhallogen,
Hmurresh,
Suthis
Cha,
Vermistra, Shreech, and many others, including
monstrous legends like the Night Dragon, the
Behemoth, the Basilisk, the Sea Monster, and the
Gargoyle.
It was once postulated by the insane mystic Aughm
Lightchaser that there were twenty-three major Dark
Lords; a good number of them are included on the

RUNES OF DOOM
The Death Rune above is derived from an inverted
Rune of Life, or living being, and symbolises the
opposite force, that of death. The Chaos Rune below
shows a circle, meaning both nothingness and all
things, the paradox at the heart of Chaos.
Chapter 1 - The Celestial Court and Beyond
The Demon Princes, Masters of the Pit
The Masters of the Pit are the three ruling Snake
Demons; Sith, Ishtra and Myurr. They are served by
the four Night Demons, who are the generals of the
Legion of the Damned. As such, Sith is served by
Relem and Vradna, Ishtra by Shakor and Myurr by
Kalin.
These are the seven major Demon Princes that rule
the eight planes of the Abyssal Pit. However, other
Demon Princes, some rogue, some exiled, and some
simply rumoured about or hinted at, are thought to
exist. See p42 for more information, as well as The
Rough Guide to the Pit (p8-16).

Unlike some Dark Lords, such as Slangg or Tanit, the
worship of Demons is outlawed in every normal
society as it is unquestionably an Evil act. Thus,
Demon worshippers are typically driven into hiding
and underground. They form weird cults, sects and
covens that meet secretively in cellars, sewers, stone
circles and abandoned buildings to conduct their
ghastly demonic rites.
DEMON PRINCE SIGILS
Below are the sigils of the three most powerful
Demon Princes; the Snake Demons Sith, Ishtra and
Myurr. Followers will have a holy symbol in the form
of the sigil and may have it ta0ooed or even branded
on their skin!
Ishtra
Sacred Colour: Green
Myurr

Congregations of Demon-worshippers are known
from cursed cities and realms including Blackhaven,
Bathoria, Mortvania, Lupravia, the City of Mazes and
Zagoula. Others may frequent lonelier locales, like
those who follow the Ice Demon of the Crystal Caves,
or the Coven of Midnight in Ruddlestone.
Such gatherings will have some sort of secret
password required to a0end, and may well hold
separate ceremonies of initiation for new recruits.
Woe betide those who fail to pass the initiation tests;
sacrifices are always required by the Demon Princes!
Hashak the Creator and his Children
Hashak the Creator was originally a minor Demigod
in the service of Throff the earth Goddess. However,
he was subsequently awarded inadvertent progenitor
status by stealing some magical clay from Throff (see
Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p148-149), and
using it to create the races of Orcs, Goblins (who also
became Gremlins and Troglodytes), and Trolls, with
some particularly Chaos-warped Orcs going on to
mutate into the race of Ogres.
All of these races were hidden on Titan by Hashak so
that Throff would not discover them, but became
afflicted with Evil and Chaos by the Dark Lords.
Thus, in addition to Hashak, your average Orc
Shaman or Troll Witch-doctor may also follow one of
the three major Dark Lords; Death, Disease or Decay,
or one of the major Demon Princes. They may also
favour Almor the wolf God, or Urk the Orc champion
of the First Ba0le.
These at least are the major Gods of the Hashak
created races; some of these people may have slightly
different belief pa0erns. Goblins, for instance, are
known for their rock-worshipping festivals and their
deification of any martyred hero, resulting in a
bewildering pantheon of various Goblin warriors
most of whom have died in particularly horrible
ways.
Other races, such as Gremlins and Troglodytes, may
offer prayers to Dhaktili, God of the underworld, and
some of the Beast Lords; likewise Marsh Goblins
follow Vurrk, God of the swamp, and the more
disgusting marsh-loving deities of the Animal Court,
such as Siluva.

Places of worship used by Orcs, Goblins and Trolls
are usually crude affairs, with stone or wooden idols
decorated with whatever has been scavenged from
elsewhere.
There is invariably an altar, generally caked in
bloodstains and gore, and trophies from epic ba0les
or the weapons of martyred heroes. Still, crude does
not mean small; some Temples to Almor or Hashak
feature enormous stone statues of the Deity, at whose
feet prayers are offered.
Chapter 1 - The Celestial Court and Beyond
Caarth and the Snake People
The prime Patron of the Caarth is of course the
Demon Prince Sith, known in Djaratian times as
Sithera, Goddess of Evil, and it is her cult that
commands the greatest respect of the Snake People.
However, other deities are also very important, and
include Vermistra the snake Goddess, her son
Sussussurr, the God of serpentine strength, and
H’ssghkull and S’hghkull, the sacred mother and
father respectively of the Caarth race.
Yet more Gods include Trabaten, God of torturers,
anatomists, dissectionists, and the more blood-
thirsty, entrail-reading diviners and soothsayers who
frequent Caarth Temples and laboratories.
Such a strong and powerful series of Priesthoods has
meant a lot of recent internecine conflict within the
Caarth citadels and se0lements, as each cult or sect
seeks to undermine another. This explains the current
waning of Caarth civilisation, at least in comparison
to the nearby Lizard Men of Silur Cha.
In their labyrinthine stone cities, the Caarth are ruled
over by demonic sorcerers and high Priests. Tales of
their jewelled Temples and mystic libraries have long
driven adventurers to a0empt to reach these cities but
few if any return. Those who do are often insane;
witness the plight of the Serpent Queen of Port
Blacksand, a normal human being until altered by
experimental magic.
Such Rituals also account for the servitor races and
creatures of the Caarth, including the Serpent Guards
(Justrali), Cobra People (Kassistra), and the Gretch,
all of whom also follow the snake Gods and demons
of their Caarth masters.

Lizard Men of Silur Cha
Similar to the Caarth, the Lizard Men Priesthood is
also split by schisms, and while there are only three
major deities that are worshipped by the majority, it
is still complicated. Suthis Cha the lizard God is of
course the progenitor God of all Lizard Men.
However, by a0empting and failing to swallow the
mouse God Kareep, his absence left the Lizard Men
ripe for conversion to another divine entity. In this
case it was Ishtra, who is now their main Patron.
Deities with lesser followings include Sebekus the
crocodile God, Vurrk the Demigod of the swamp, and
Aqualis in his form as Cracca, the crocodile-headed
river God.
Also, in the thriving Temple district-pontoons of Silur
Cha’s swampland se0lements can be found a baffling
diversity of yet more Evil Dark Lords and Demon
Princes as minor sects and cults, but each God of
which is depicted in Lizard Man or at least reptilian
form.
Thus, while Slangg is an obese saurian humanoid,
Trabaten is a bloodstained scale-skinned man armed
with a knife, and so on and so forth. These are also
followed by other reptilian races present within Silur
Cha, including Calacorms, Chameleonites, and the
Cleaver.
All of them, and also the Mutant Lizard Men, stay out
of the way of the Liash Cha, the two-headed Lizard
Men Priests who are ever on the lookout for Ritual
sacrifice victims. Always recognisable by their red
robes (for only they can wear the colour), the Liash
Cha are powerful personages with their own
language, and are usually the only literate Lizard
Men.
Two thousand such Priests dwell at the Temple of
Ishtra in the centre of the Silur Cha swamps, an
immense astronomical monastery that contains a
great store of knowledge, collected over the centuries
by the Liash Cha.

Dark Elves of Tìranduil Kelthas
These nefarious beings of the underearth beneath
Titan worship horrific deities and Demon Princes in
their major subterranean city of Tìranduil Kelthas
and
other
enormous
underground
cavern
communities elsewhere. Their two major favoured
deities are Slangg, God of malice, who they know as
Ar Anwar Gerithan, the “Grey Whisperer of
Shadows”, and the Demon Prince Myurr, for his
patience and trickery appeals to their own inherently
devious nature.
Other deities worshipped by the Darkside Elves
include Slangg’s sister Tanit, Goddess of envy,
Trabaten, God of torturers, Shekka, Goddess of
witches, and Quezkari, God of Evil sorcery. They also
offer prayers to appropriate Beast Lords, minor Dark
Lords, and other Demon Princes in the garish Temple
districts of their se0lements.

Other People of Evil and Chaos
Of the other Evil races on, beneath, or above Titan,
most would worship an applicable Beast Lord, Dark
Lord or Demon Prince, depending on their
proclivities, though there are exceptions. Life-
Stealers, for example, are worshippers of Sukh, the
God of storms. Others are more straightforward; the
tentacled Brain Slayers are followers of the
Behemoth, Chaos Demigod of the sea, whereas Shark
-Kin obviously pay homage to the shark Goddess
Karkara. Chaos Beast Men are devotees of Belthegor,
God of second life and Chaos Mutants; Rat Men obey
the strictures of both Disease and Shreech the Rat
King. The below list contains but a brief selection,
there are of course many other examples that may be
devised by the Director as needed.

RANDOM GOD GENERATOR
It may be necessary during the course of a game or
campaign to randomly generate a God, perhaps as
Patron of a city, Temple, Hero or non-player Priest.
To do this, roll one die, then two dice, then one die
again, to randomly determine one of the 132 Gods
present in this book from the Random God Generator
table on the next page. The rolling of two dice means
the table is weighted towards a selection of more
commonly
occurring
Gods
that
would
be
worshipped upon the world of Titan.
