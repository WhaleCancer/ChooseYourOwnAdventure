**God of Second Life**

**Specific Power:** Belthegor's Touch

A Priest of Belthegor may, once per day, touch a target and cause them to suffer an immediate Chaos Mutation. Roll on the table in Beyond the Pit (p31), or Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1 (p57), to determine the type and effect of the mutation. This can be reversed by the Cure Disease power of another Priest.

**General Powers:**

- Commune
- Curse
- Weakness

Belthegor is an Evil God worshipped by Chaos Mutants in foul sewers beneath the port-cities of the Old World, such as Blackhaven (rumoured to have an abandoned shrine containing the relic known as the Mask of Belthegor), the Port of Crabs, and the City of Mazes. He appears as a hairless, yet handsome, strong-featured man, but in some way u0erly loathsome and disturbing.

The Gifts of Belthegor are the many, varied mutations with which he taints his followers and are reputed to number three hundred and twenty-three. Belthegor's Priests wear purple robes, and his symbol is a black circle, the Rune of Chaos. Given the illicit nature of worshipping such a vile Deity, the Priests have in times past used a simple runic alphabet to communicate with each other.
