Sku-Rachi is the Panther God of Titan, sibling to the other feline deities [Rogaar](Rogaar.md), [Magir](Magir.md), and [Meerar](Meerar.md), and lord of panthers, leopards, jaguars, pumas and cheetahs.

His idols depict a powerful black panther, with eyes of flame and claws of steel, or a squat man with a panther's head. Sku-Rachi is worshipped by a disparate collection of isolated cultures; the leopard cults, Panther Warriors, and Werepanthers of southern Allansia certainly, as well as at obscure locales including the infamous Tower of the Cheetah in the decadent Khulian se0lement of Zagoula, the people of the Kazanid city of Yigenik, and the principalities of Mauristatia such as Skeln and Throngard.

The chosen colours of Sku-Rachi are yellow with black spots, and his symbol is a snarling black panther.
