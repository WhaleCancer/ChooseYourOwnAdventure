The Mantis Goddess Vurgothrax stalked forth on the side of Evil and Chaos during the First Battle, yet another insect Demigod unable to break their sacred ties to [Hmurresh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hmurresh), Queen of the Flies. She usually takes the form of a gigantic mantis with spiny clawed forelimbs covered in gore from the victims she has devoured.

Those bizarre creatures the Mantis Men pay homage to Vurgothrax, as do weird monk-like cults in the city-states of the Glimmering Sea, such as Agra, Alkemis and Bei-Han (who ta0oo her image upon their foreheads), and she often rewards her most devout followers by granting them a guardian avatar in the form of a Mantis Demon. Her sacred colour is red and her symbol is a mantis.

The Shrines to Vurgothrax are, strangely, infested with flies that buzz around the interior, although the reasoning behind this is to offer food to the Mantises that live on the carved trees around the upper walls. Although most of these are smaller than a human hand, some are larger than a dog!
