Hamaskis is one of the major Gods, and is the Patron of all scholars, teachers and mages. [Elves](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) know him as Livurien the Sorcerer, while to the ancient Djaratians he was called Khunam, and elsewhere he is known as Serion and Tyralar. Hamaskis is a greater God and a member of the Hall of Mind, but in some uncivilised lands, such as Kakhabad, he is not recognised at all.

He is, however, Patron God of the learned race of sages known as the Hamakei. Depicted as an elderly man, or youth, reading a huge book, his Priests wear purple robes, and his symbol is a staff or scroll. Priests of Hamaskis often wander the countryside bringing information and teaching to the populace. Holy days of Hamaskis include the 2nd of Unlocking and the 12th of Fire.
