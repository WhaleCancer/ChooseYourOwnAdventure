Known by many names – the Monkey God, the Ape God, and the Baboon God – P'thekwa is a member of the Animal Court and rarely worshipped upon Titan these days, except by obscure cults in distant southern city-states, aggressive Ape Men from the forests and wastes of Allansia, and the poorly known Monkey Men of the islands in the Black Ocean.

The adventurer Sartosa Lux was reputed to have stolen the Heartfire Ruby from the lost Temple of the Monkey God in the jungle-clad mountains of far Arantis. This may or may not be the same site as the rumours of a ruined Djaratian city dedicated to the Baboon God. This city is populated entirely by such creatures, ruling over the rubble and its denizens as a king or queen and their court would rule over common people.

P'thekwa is typically depicted as a large powerful primate of its type, often with a golden circlet around its brow and a wooden staff clutched in one hand. The holy colour of the Monkey God is yellow, and their sacred symbol is that of a monkey (sometimes depicted as covering its eyes, ears or mouth), often carved as a green or yellow jade totem.
