## God or Goddess of Reason

**Specific Power:** Sentient Uplift

The Priest can bestow the power of increased intelligence upon either themselves or someone else by touch. If applied to a creature with None, Low, or Average Intelligence, they will instantly gain High Intelligence. This does not mean that they can communicate using languages however. If the recipient was already a High Intelligence sentient humanoid or other creature, they gain the benefit of even more heightened intelligence and wisdom, equivalent to a +2 bonus to any Knowledge Special Skill tests. This power lasts for as many hours as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Commune
- Ward

Ititia is the God of Reason and Choice, an important part of the Elven pantheon, and one of the Children of Erillia the Elf Mother (and known to humans as [Galana](Galana.md)). Elves depict Ititia as a tall thin human-like being with jagged features in purple robes, however the pupils of Ititia's eyes are not round but instead are serpent-like. Interestingly, human cultures depict Ititia as old, wise and female, through mythical avatars such as Aletheia the Sage of the Glimmering Sea or Vashti the Ageless of Maiden's Vale. They are worshipped by all Elves.

Ititia is also known among human nations, including philosopher-mystics from the Varadian Alliance of the Arrowhead Archipelago, and in Allansia. Talking animals are said to be "Blessed by both [Euthillial](Euthillial.md) and Ititia!" The Spirit of Ititia was one of three magical Vapours born to Queen Ethilesse of Sti0le Woad. The holy colour of Ititia is purple, and their symbol is that of a stylised apple seed or teardrop.
