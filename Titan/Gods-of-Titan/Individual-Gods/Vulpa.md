Vulpa is the Goddess of foxes and jackals, and younger sister to the Wolf God [Almor](Almor.md) and [Durrak](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#durrak), God of Dogs. A loyal companion of [Filash](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#filash), the God of Flame, Vulpa appears as a blazing Firefox of powerful build.

She has also been known to associate with [Logaan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan) the Trickster God on occasion. Because of Vulpa's standing, the fifteenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Fox. Vulpa is worshipped mainly by Werefoxes. Her symbol is a fox and her sacred colour is red. The Hour of the Fox is considered holy for Vulpa.

Strangely enough, many farmers (especially those with large flocks of poultry) will have a small shrine to Vulpa near the boundary of their land. Their hope is that by offering a few prayers here (and leaving an offering of a naturally deceased chicken or two) they can satisfy the normally insatiable demands of this Goddess and her foxes. This doesn't always work, but the practice persists in rural areas of Titan.
