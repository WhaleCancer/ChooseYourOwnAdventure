Electron is the Lord of Thunder, a demiurge of [Sukh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sukh), and, like his sister Thyra Migurn, given to materialising on Titan and harassing lone wanderers, accompanied by his malevolent hulking Thunder Beasts. Both Electron and his accomplices appear as creatures of living electrical flame, armed with coruscating tridents, and if his Thunder Beasts are defeated, Electron will challenge the survivor(s) to a riddling contest.

Those who successfully answer the riddles of Electron are rewarded with powerful enchanted items such as the Bolt of Decimation, or other boons (those who fail are typically blasted with a lightning bolt). Electron dwells in a great cloud palace on the Magical Plane of Air with his hordes of Thunder Beasts and is the eternal enemy of both Lightning and Storm Demons, who occasionally mount raids on his stronghold.

The sacred colour of Electron is dark grey, and his holy symbol is a cloud. He is not worshipped so much as placated, by Tribesmen, Amazons, and others who dwell on the plains and in the uplands of north-eastern Khul.
