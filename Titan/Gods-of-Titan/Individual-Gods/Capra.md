Capra is the God of goats, sheep, and other such herbivorous mammals. He distinguished himself during the First Battle, fighting alongside [Istarel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#istarel), [Ski0a](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ski0a) and [Grush](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#grush), and thus the sixth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Goat.

Capra is also associated with [Varantar](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#varantar) the Shepherd God, and there is even a town called Capra named after the Goat Lord on the baking Axehead Plains of southern Allansia, near the doomed city of Vymorna. He is followed as a prime Deity by the Satyrs and She-Satyrs, and he despises in turn the mutant Chaos Beast Men, many of whom often exhibit warped goat-like traits.

Capra is also worshipped by [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), for these hardy mountain folk can be shepherds, and even sometimes use great Mountain Rams as cavalry mounts. The holy colour of Capra is grey and his symbol is that of a goat or a goat horn.
