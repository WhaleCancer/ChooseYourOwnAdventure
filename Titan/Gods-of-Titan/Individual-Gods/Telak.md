The son of [Courga](Courga.md) and [Fourga](Fourga.md), Telak is the God of Courage, and also the Patron God of all soldiers, knights and warriors. Telak is worshipped across Titan largely under that name, but is also known as Orial, the Swordbearer, the Shieldbearer, and the Warrior. He is depicted as a heavily armoured warrior with a gold sword and armour, often accompanied by [Rogaar](Rogaar.md) the Lion Lord. Telak is the Patron God of Ruddlestone, as well as the besieged city of Vymorna in Allansia (itself a link to an earlier culture from the lost city of Kharnek.

His Priests usually wear gold-engraved armour or robes made from cloth-of-gold, and his symbol is a golden sword. His followers often get a golden sword ta0ooed on the back of their sword hand, for be0er luck in combat. A number of religious artefacts are associated with Telak, including the Golden Sword of Telak (see Demons of Doom, p56), gifted occasionally to a courageous follower, as well as a collection of mysterious items called the Arm and Eyes of Telak.

Because of Telak's standing, the seventh year in the eight-year cycle that reckons time in the remote Khulian kingdom of Hachiman, is known as the Year of the Sword. Holy days of Telak include the 11th of Unlocking and the 4th of Watching.
