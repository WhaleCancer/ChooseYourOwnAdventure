**Goddess of Lightning**

**Specific Power:** Wrath of Thyra Migurn

The Priest may, if outside, cause a lighting bolt to strike a single visible enemy within 10 metres per point of Devotion, for 2d6 STAMINA damage. The damage is doubled if the enemy is wearing metal armour. There is no real requirement for a storm to be overhead when using the power, although there may still be a clap of thunder to accompany the lightning bolt.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Protection versus Demons
- Smite versus Demons

Thyra Migurn is the Goddess of Lightning, another demiurge of [Sukh](Sukh.md) like her brother [Electron](Electron.md), and also known as the Mistress of Sukh's Tower. She is given to materialising upon Titan and harassing lone wayfarers and rewarding them if they are courageous enough. One such location is the spire shaped Storm Mountain in the Freezeblood Mountains near Sardath, where legend has it an adventurer from Grimmund won a Lightning Sword and Sphere from Thyra Migurn after he bested her avatar.

Interestingly, she detests [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) and their tunnelling beneath the mountains, though the cause of this feud is unknown, at least on the Dwarf side of things, and she also hates the Dark Elves with great passion.

Thyra Migurn manifests in several forms, including a tall woman in silver armour, with long silver hair and armed with a silver sword sheathed in lightning. Other forms are a humanoid form made from fiery plasma and cloaked in a black robe, or a spi0ing ball of chain lightning. She is the sworn enemy of the Lightning Demons from the Demonic Planes of Steel and Platinum. The symbol of Thyra Migurn is a lightning bolt and her favoured colour is silver.
