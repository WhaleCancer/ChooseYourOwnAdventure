Zygolophaunt is another Demigod of the Animal Court, the Patron Deity of large mammalian pachyderms including elephants, rhinoceroses, Hippohogs, and mammoths. He fought alongside [Rogaar](Rogaar.md) and [Telak](Telak.md) during the First Battle but is now somewhat forgo0en and obscure. Still, Zygolophaunt is worshipped by Rhinofolk in particular, who venerate him as the great Barrier of Faith.

Mahouts in southern countries, particularly Arantis, the city states of the Glimmering Sea, Far Analand, Hachiman, the Isles of the Dawn and the Inland Sea satrapies, all pay homage, as do Northmen ivory hunters of the tundra in Allansia, Tusker Mammoth-Riders from Kazan, and the peculiar race of creatures known as Mucalytics.

Zygolophaunt appears as an immense, thick skinned ungulate pachyderm, with the body of an elephant. His head is also roughly elephantine, however the ears are smaller and the trunk shorter, being more similar to that of a tapir, while tusks protrude from his mouth and a single large horn curves out from the top of his snout. The holy colour of Zygolophaunt is grey, and his symbol is the head of either a rhinoceros or an elephant. The Hour of the Elephant is considered sacred for Zygolophaunt.
