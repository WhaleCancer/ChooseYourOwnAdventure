The third daughter of [Sindla](Sindla.md) (the others being [Asrel](Asrel.md) and [Libra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#libra)), Usrel is a minor Goddess, though still a member of the Hall of the Mind, worshipped primarily wherever unwanted wars occur.

Usrel is depicted as a motherly figure embracing the world in her arms, and is also known as Liriel, Enkala, Ageral and Westrëa. There is usually li0le in the way of organised religion following Usrel, as there is li0le need for her worship in areas that are se0led and peaceful, which are naturally those most conducive to Temple-building.

There are rumours of one secret militant order of Usrel dedicated to opposing the machinations of [The Malice](The-Malice.md). It seems strange to have a militant order for a Goddess of Peace, but their methods include stopping wars, preventing conflict and reducing hatred, whether by bribery, persuasion or, occasionally, targeted and dispassionate force!

There are however many wandering Priests, wearing their white robes and bearing the symbol of the white flower. She is the mother of [Courga](Courga.md) and [Fourga](Fourga.md). Holy days of Usrel include the 30th of Fire.
