The brother of [Hydana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana) and [Pangara](Pangara.md), Sukh is one of the major Gods, and also known as Whaan or Tir. He is considered to have a violent and changeable temper, and to be indiscriminate when angry. His Priests wear dark grey robes, and his symbol is a skull with a circular mouth. His servants, the race of Life Stealers, are a truly Evil race despite the neutral aspect of their lord.

Sukh commonly has Temples at seaports across Titan; for example Port Blacksand has a large and ornate Temple that is the responsibility of the High Priest Orvyn Hal`lood. Each Temple has a tower from which an acolyte, known as the Voice on the Wind, calls worshippers to prayer every evening. Deities associated with Sukh include [Electron](Electron.md) the Lord of thunder, [Thyra Migurn](Thyra-Migurn.md) the Goddess of lightning, and [Kukulak](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kukulak), the rival Khulian God of storms!

For more information about Sukh in his role as one of the planets in the skies of Titan, see Chapter 4. The Allansian month of Dark and the Khulian month of Heaven's Weeping are both dedicated to him, as are Stormsday in Allansia and the Old World, and Wildday in Khul, as well as the Hour of the Clouds. Holy days of Sukh include the 15th of Freeze, and the 8th and 22nd of Hiding.
