Scra0a is the Demigod of centipedes and millipedes and worshipped by subterranean races such as the Troglodytes, Skolotaurs, hunting tribes from the southern jungles, and nomads from the Twin Sun Desert who use Sandcrawler centipedes as transport.

Legend tells of a small building in the Dead City of southern Khul that is li0le more than a huge pair of stone doors with a sloping roof behind. The entire surface of each door is covered with a twisting relief of thousands of inter-twining centipedes both large and small. Behind these doors a tunnel slopes downwards into the darkness, said to contain a twisting labyrinth of rooms, tunnels and chambers dedicated to the worship of Scra0a. Most alarmingly, just inside the doors are metal manacles a0ached to the walls, and the stone below is stained a dark reddish-brown.

He appears as a giant centipede of awesome proportions. The holy colour of Scra0a Many-Legged is orange, and his symbol is a centipede coiled into the shape of a figure of eight.
