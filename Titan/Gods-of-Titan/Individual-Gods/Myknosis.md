**The Mushroom God**

**Specific Power:** Animate Fungi

The Priest may cause all fungi within 5m to become animated, hindering enemies of the Priest. The effect will vary with the number of fungi in the affected area but will cause all enemies within this area to suffer a penalty to any and all physical actions, including combat.

Low infestations of mushrooms and toadstools may induce a penalty of -1 as they spit spore-clouds and squirm underfoot, while thick thrashing fungal jungle undergrowth could cause a penalty that could be as high as -5.

**General Powers:**

- Commune
- Cure Poison and Disease
- Heal

Myknosis is the Fungus God of Titan, Lord of the Purple Mushroom and Master of Slow Rot. They stand opposed to [Galana](Galana.md), Goddess of fertility, and take the form of an enormous humanoid mushroom, a sombre shade of violet in hue, with glowing golden eyes. Myknosis is worshipped predominantly by colonies of Rust Demons within the Pit, on both the Planes of Rust and Ichor, and on Titan by small colony-pods of Fungoids and Spore-People.

Rumour holds that subterranean vaults beneath Shakuru, City of Beggars, are devoted to the following of the Fungus God and the harvesting of tuber-like pale fungi, food for the ta0ered hordes of that foul place. The most sacred site for worshippers of the Mushroom God, however, remains the Shrine of the Myknotic Eye, within the oasis-city of Qag upon the Plane of Rust. The holy colour of Myknosis is purple, and their symbol is a mushroom.
