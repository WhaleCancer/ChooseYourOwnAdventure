Khepra Dark-Shell is the near-forgotten Beetle God of ancient Djarat, and only worshipped these days by obscure races such as the Droug and the Weevil Men, or secretive cults of the Inland Sea region of Khul. Legend holds that Khepra was an armoured behemoth as big as a hill, with a toothed beak, insectoid limbs and a forked red tongue, who thundered across the lands of Titan during the Deep Night. Along with other insectoid Gods he is a lord of pestilence and decay, and his acolytes are armed with long dirks and wear crocodile-skin armour. The chosen colour of Khepra is dark green and his symbol is a beetle.
