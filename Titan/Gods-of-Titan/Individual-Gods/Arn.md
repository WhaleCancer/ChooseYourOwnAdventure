## The First God

**Specific Power:** First and the Last

Invoking this power before a battle, the Priest can choose when to be active every Attack Round. For example, one round they may wish to strike first, while another round they may choose to let others have priority before deciding when and what to do. A Priest can use this power once per day, and it lasts for as many Attack Rounds as their Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Create Food and Water
- Cure Poison and Disease
- Heal

The First God, the Holiest of Holies, Arn was the Progenitor, the form from which all else derives. However, their preeminence was superseded, first by the primal deities of [Ashra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ashra), [Elim](Elim.md) and [Vuh](Vuh.md), and then alongside them as exiles following the rise of [Titan](Titan.md) and the younger Gods. Arn takes the form of a bald man or woman sitting cross-legged, deep in thought.

They are still worshipped in several places upon Titan, notably the Inland Sea (where they are known as Aan Tal), the Isles of the Dawn (who believe upon death they will ascend to Heaven to join Arn), the kingdom of Zamarra (among the Wazarri Priests), some city-states of the Glimmering Sea (such as Agra and Bei-Han), and possibly Throben. Some even say the mysterious Netherworld Sorcerers of northern Gallantaria are not mere disciples of the neutral Trickster Gods but instead devotees of Arn the First.

Certainly, Arn's worship has inspired the lives of many great avatars in their name, including the Sitting Prophet (followed in turn by the amphibious Kreehuls), and the holy man Shazi of Sunara. The sacred colour of Arn is red and their symbol is a white face.
