**God of Winds**

**Specific Power:** Breath of Pangara

The Priest may, by initially extending their hands, cause a strong wind to blow in whichever direction is desired. This wind will last for a number of hours equal to the Priest's Devotion score, or when the Priest desires the effect to end, whichever is sooner. This wind can be used to fill the sails on a small ship, can cause havoc in a scribe's office, etc., and will also cause all missile weapon attacks in the area to be made with a penalty of -2.

**General Powers:**

- Heal
- Sanctuary
- Smite versus underground creatures

Brother of [Sukh](Sukh.md) and [Hydana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana), Pangara is worshipped and appeased by sailors and those who are planning a journey by sea and is also known as Father of the Four Winds (who are Auros, Boreas, Hagrel, and Zephyrus). He is usually depicted as a thick-set balding man, whose cheeks have been inflated with air that he is about to expel through his mouth.

Some claim that Pangara created the Bird Men in the beginning of days and is their Patron, and he is also followed by the race of creatures known as Scouts. On Titan, Pangara's most favoured followers dwell among the floating archipelago of Pangaria, while other well known servants of the God include the Keeper of the Four Winds on Femphrey's Howling Plains, and also the King of the Four Winds, who rules the garden isle of Trysta in Khul's Inland Sea.

The Priests of Pangara wear light grey robes, and the God's symbol is a stylised gust of wind. The Allansian month of Winds and the Khulian month of Birds Cha0er are both sacred to Pangara, as well as Windsday in Allansia and the Old World.
