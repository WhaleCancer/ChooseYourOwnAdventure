The Malice is thought to be a [Dark Lord](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md) who was imprisoned upon Titan following the First Battle. The Malice is not exactly the God "of" anything. They could more accurately be described as distilled hatred and anger, created into an immortal physical form. Although he has been imprisoned for long ages, some say that any great outbreak of anger and hatred (such as a war or riot) is due to the influence of this God.

More than that, the hatred and destruction that results from such a war or riot further feeds the power of this God, and there are rumours of ancient prophecies that predict the escape and return of this God if ever there is enough hatred in the world!

Since then their influence and worship has seeped out into the world; the Dark Chasms beneath the Khulian kingdom of Gorak are believed to be one such conduit of Evil. Avatars of the Malice appear on Titan as things from nightmares; an amalgam of everything their victim has ever feared. Acolytes of the Malice wear black, and the symbol of the God is a black rectangle or black door.
