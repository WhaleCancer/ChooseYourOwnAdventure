Meerar is the Goddess of Cats, known in ancient Djaratian times as Seket, Goddess of joy, where she took the form of a cat-headed woman in golden robes. She is the prime Deity for all cats, wild and domestic, and is followed by Werecats, the Cat-People of central Allansia, the nomadic Laupers of Khul's arid heartlands, and the human tribes of the Isles of Scars and Despair.

The Bazouk, a breed of grey cats from the Khulian kingdom of Gorak, even consider themselves to be the children of the Cat Goddess. Because of Meerar's standing, the eighteenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Cat, while in southern Allansia lies Mount Meerar, one of the Three Tiger Mountains on the edge of the Plain of Bronze, and reputed gateway to the Invisible City.

The holy colour of Meerar is grey, but could also be red, white, black or brown, depending on location, while her symbol is that of a cat si0ing upright on its haunches. Confusingly, the symbol of [Courga](Courga.md), Goddess of grace also takes the form of a cat, while [Logaan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan) the Trickster often appears as a mischievous black cat, and [Kilanirax](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kilanirax), the Lord of Dragons, has disguised himself as a slightly rotund ginger cat at times.
