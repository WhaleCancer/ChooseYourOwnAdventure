Rogaar is the Lord of Lions, and boon companion to [Telak](Telak.md), God of courage. He is the most powerful Deity among the Animal Court save for the Dragon King [Kilanirax](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kilanirax), with whose daughter, the Gold Dragon Chrysolla, Rogaar conceived the race of Dracons.

Rogaar is also worshipped by the nomadic Felinaurs as the Lion God Kurawu, who likewise consider themselves his sin-defiled offspring. Guardian Deity of both lions and related species, such as the terrifying Black Lion, Rogaar appears as a gigantic regal male lion with a golden mane and a sandy pelt.

Rogaar's Hold, a peak in the Lion Heights of central Allansia and partnering the nearby Durtelakin ("Telak's Mount"), is said to be his domain upon Titan. (Curiously, also in the vicinity lies Mount Rogaar, one of the Three Tiger Mountains on the edge of the Plain of Bronze.)

The holy colour of Rogaar is gold, his symbol is a roaring lion, and ivory lion charms in his image are said to ward against Evil magic. Because of Rogaar's standing, the second year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time is known as the Year of the Lion, and the constellation bearing his name can also be seen in the northern skies. The Hour of the Lion is considered sacred for Rogaar. Holy days of Rogaar include the 14th of Winds and the 21st of Hiding.
