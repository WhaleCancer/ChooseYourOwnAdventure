**God of Pirates**

**Specific Power:** Whistle up a Wind

Once per day, the Priest can simply whistle up a wind; by pursing their lips and blowing a hopeful tune, a wind will appear to do the Priest's bidding – a strong breeze springs up capable of propelling a sizeable vessel. This increased movement rate can be kept up for as many hours as the Priest's Devotion score, although the Priest cannot take any other significant actions during this time. A ship powered by this spell will use a Wind Speed of 5 to calculate daily movement and will have no effect if the natural wind is stronger than Grade 5.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Cure Poison and Disease
- Create Food and Water

Dalgalla was supposedly a holy man and founder of old Blacksand Town, who was deified after his death around 121 AC, into a sort of Patron saint of pirates. It is often claimed that prayers to his memory have produced miracles, though these stories usually prove to be false. The truth is rather more prosaic; there was a man called Daralaga who was a pirate captain's first mate; he may have se0led in the original progenitor of Port Blacksand, but he was never a holy man.

Nevertheless, Dalgalla has taken on the mantle of the nameless Pirate God, who is worshipped at the ends of the earth, in every stinking corrupt cityport and buccaneer's den, whether it be Tak, the City of Mazes, the Blood Islands, or the Port of Crabs. Dalgalla is the name applied to this God along the western Allansian seaboard; other regions will have different names, such as the pirates of the Inland Sea who honour him as Edeluk. The holy colour of Dalgalla is of course black, and his symbol is a skull and crossbones!
