## God of Volcanoes

**Specific Power:** Gift of Lorodil

Once per day, the Priest may cause a minor volcanic eruption from any piece of ground. Any creature standing on the site of the eruption takes 1d6 STAMINA damage, as does any creature stepping in it. After 5 Attack Rounds, the lava returns to the ground, leaving it un-scarred.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Heal
- Incite

The son of [Throff](Throff.md) and [Filash](Filash.md), Lorodil is the God of volcanoes and magma. Although sometimes associated with Chaos, he is in fact a very Lawful Deity who simply has scant regard for any unfortunate creatures that get in the path of his sacred lava.

He is worshipped in areas prone to volcanic activity and by Dwarfs (who know him as Kalarilekkîn), all of whom hope Lorodil will be benevolent and protect them from volcanic eruptions.

Indeed, Lorodil is "worshipped" by far greater numbers than those that are his faithful. Anyone living near an active volcano will make small offerings to this God, offer prayers and wear his holy symbol, even if their primary Deity is different. After all, what is there to lose?

His Temples are usually constructed from volcanic rock, his Priests wear red, and his symbol is a volcano.
