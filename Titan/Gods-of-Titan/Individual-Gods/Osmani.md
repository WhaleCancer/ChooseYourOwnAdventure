**God of Mercenaries**

**Specific Power:** Mighty Strike

When the Priest uses this power, it will allow them to do greatly increased damage for one combat only, and it will last for as many A0ack Rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion score. It will allow the Priest to roll two separate dice for damage. The results of each Damage Roll are both applied to the target, and indeed any bonuses to the Damage Roll are applied to both rolls as well.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Heal
- Incite

Osmani is the God of Mercenaries, of Strongarms, hire-swords and sell-blades, of battle and war. Thought by some to be the brother of [Telak](Telak.md), Osmani chose neutrality over Good or Evil and fought for no one in the First Battle save himself.

His appearance depends on his followers; city-states with standing armies of professional soldiers depict him as a successful warrior, all gleaming armour and shiny weapons, while in war-torn regions he is imagined more as one of the people, a scarred warrior with ba0ered gear and equipment.

Interestingly, in eastern Khul, the Islands of the Dawn, and the Arrowhead Archipelago, Osmani is depicted as a terrifying warrior-woman with a two handed sword, lacquered armour, and known as Quel Damoth, while in Allansia his name is Grang, and invoked as a curse whenever the odds are poor, and the chances of survival are slim. His (or her!) holy colour is iron-grey and the sacred symbol is a grey sword, that mercenaries often ta0oo on the back of their favoured weapon hand.
