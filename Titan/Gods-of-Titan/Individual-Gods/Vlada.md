Vlada is the God of Trade and Gambling. Also known as Dumiol or Kalankto, his allegiances are obscure, but on some level, he is thought to be related to the Trickster Gods, [Logaan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan), [Kata](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kata) and [Petros](Petros.md), or perhaps a go-between for them with [Sindla](Sindla.md), Goddess of Luck.

Essentially a God of good fortune and wealth, Vlada is venerated not just by merchants and traders but also many other city folks besides, whose lifestyles are intertwined with the intended imminent accumulation of riches. His appearance varies considerably from place to place; for example, in central Allansia, Vlada is revered as an immensely fat man of gold with three jewelled eyes and flanked by two flamingos, while in the Old World, and especially Kakhabad (where he is also known as Garamosé), Vlada's form is a tall bronze man with a club and a begging bowl.

Likewise, the devotional places of Vlada also differ considerably, from small shrines maintained within local merchants' guilds, to mercantile Temples with dedicated Priest-traders, to sacred recreational spaces, such as the infamous Gambling Halls of Kharé. The holy symbol of Vlada is a coin, and his chosen colours are silver and gold. Holy days of Vlada include the Feast of Dumiol on the 22nd of Sowing, and the Feast of Gold on the 24th of Close.
