The brother of [Fulkra](Fulkra.md), Solinthar is worshipped at almost every port, fishing village or quay, even if just a small shrine is the focus of said worship. There is a particularly fine Temple to Solinthar in Port Blacksand on Wool Street.

Well-regarded by all those who ply their trade on the ocean waves, Priests of Solinthar are thought to bring good luck to ships that carry them and they rarely have to pay for passage. It is also common for a Priest to bless a boat or ship as it leaves on a journey, even if it is only out fishing for a few hours!

There are Templars of Solinthar who often become ship's captains, mates or other senior officers. Not full Priests but nevertheless blessed by this God, they are popular with ship owners as they are thought to bring luck to a vessel and a voyage, much as full Priests do.

His Priests wear deep blue robes, and a ship is his symbol. Holy days of Solinthar include the 7th of Dark and the 4th of Sowing.
