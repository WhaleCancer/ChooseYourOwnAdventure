**Death's Messenger**

**Specific Power:** Presage Death

The Priest may, once per day, loudly announce to an enemy that Death approaches them. There is no Test for LUCK to avoid this fate, and whilst marked (for one whole combat), the face of the target will look skull-like and they will take double damage (before any armour is applied) from all sources. This power does end though if the Priest is killed!

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Incite
- Weakness

Glund is [Death](Death.md)'s Messenger, or, if you prefer, the Messenger of Death, Herald of the Dark Gods of Evil and Chaos, and Blower of the Horn that began the First Battle (and was subsequently won as a trophy by [Atlan](Atlan.md) after the forces of Good triumphed; see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p146). Glund's appearance can vary, but generally he resembles a glowing skeleton holding a scythe, sword or scimitar.

He is followed as a lesser Deity of Undead by some Bone Shamans of Bathoria and weird covens from wretched Shakuru or sha0ered Zagoula, but his most devout followers are the semi-obscure race of Skeleton Men. Priests of Glund typically wear red robes and perform sacrificial rites by casting an unfortunate victim into a burning firepit. Because of Glund's standing and courage during the First Battle, the constellation bearing his name as Death's Messenger can be seen in the southern skies of Titan. The holy symbol of Glund is a bone, and his sacred colour is white.
