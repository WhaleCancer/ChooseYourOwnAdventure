## God of Metal Workers

**Specific Power:** Forge Wisdom

Priests of Verlang will always know the quality and workmanship of any piece of metalwork, and will always know any magical additions or subtractions to A0ack Strength, Armour Rolls, or Damage Modifiers. They may (at the Director's discretion) know other magical abilities on a metal item. This power is permanent and need not be activated.

**General Powers:**

- Commune
- Heal
- Ward

Verlang is the Blacksmith of the Gods, the son of [Throff](Throff.md) and [Filash](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#filash), and the brother of [Lorodil](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#lorodil), and the Patron God of the Forge. Known to Dwarfs as Dûrevendil, and to the ancient Djaratians as Bisu the Maker God, Verlang typically appears as a mighty Dwarf smith in a leather smock, wielding an ancient bronze greathammer.

He is worshipped by Dwarfs, obviously, but also others including Storm Giants, Pangarian Goblin Technomancers, and various communities of forge-Priests, such as those of Daddu-Ley, the Copperstone Caves on the Earth End coastline of Kakhabad.

Priests of Verlang are sort of an itinerant amalgam of tinker, engineer, smith and cleric, for Verlang is not a jealous God and would rather his disciples spread the lore of metalworking far and wide. The holy colour of Verlang is grey, and his symbol is a bronze hammer on a copper chain.
