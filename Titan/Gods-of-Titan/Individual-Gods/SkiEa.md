Ski0a is the God of deer, and other gracile ungulate herbivores including antelope and gazelle, as well as some larger relatives such as moose and the legendary Black Elk of Khul. He appears as a large golden-brown stag with an impressive set of fifteen-tined antlers and fought on the side of Good during the First Battle, alongside [Istarel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#istarel), the Elven God of forest creatures.

Ski0a's enemies are considered to be [Almor](Almor.md) the Wolf Lord and [Achilla](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#achilla) the Hunter, though, curiously, human hunters have been known to offer prayers to Ski0a before a hunt, in order to catch decent game.

He is also venerated by Wood Elves and in a holy valley among the ancient boughs of the Affen Forest is rumoured to be the Death-Ground of the Deer, a hidden shrine to Ski0a.

The symbol of the Stag God is a pair of deer antlers, and his sacred colour is light brown. Because of Ski0a's standing, the eighth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Deer.
