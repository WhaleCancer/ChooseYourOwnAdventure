Another daughter of [Sindla](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sindla), Asrel is now rarely worshipped by humans at least. Her name is however often invoked by hopeful suitors and beso0ed lovers. Usually depicted as a beautiful woman, Asrel is the sister of [Usrel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#usrel) and [Libra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#libra), while some consider [Slangg](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#slangg) and [Tanit](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#tanit) her cursed offspring with [Lord Moon](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#lord-moon).

The Temples of Asrel are exquisitely designed buildings decorated with incredible skill and care. They always fit perfectly into their surroundings, and every single element is of sublime design. Even the cloths used to wipe the Priests hands during a service are beautifully woven and finished. Some very devout Temples even have a "dress code", insisting that worshippers and supplicants are at least tidy, even if they are not beautiful!

The largest congregation of Asrel-worshippers upon Titan is at Salamonis, led by Archbishop Kalivan, one of her foremost servants. Other names for Asrel include Culacara, Jerez, and Ooraseel. She has a rose for a symbol, and her Priests wear red robes. The Charm of Asrel is a mysterious holy item dedicated to her (see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p145-146).

Holy days of Asrel include the 28th of Sowing and the 4th of Fire.
