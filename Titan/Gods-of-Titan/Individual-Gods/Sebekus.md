The God Sebekus is lord of crocodiles, caimans, gharials and alligators, and companion to both [Aqualis](Aqualis.md), God of Rivers, and [Vurrk](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#vurrk), God of the Swamp. He takes the form of a gigantic crocodile with green and black scales and has few followers except among the various tribes of reptilian warriors from the Empire of Silur Cha.

However, there are very many in certain regions who will give small offerings to this God or make an occasional prayer. Crocodiles are a major threat to life (both human and livestock) in some areas and those people that live there are very aware that avoiding the a0entions of these reptiles may well depend on how respectful they are to Sebekus.

Because of his standing, the sixteenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Crocodile. The sacred colour of Sebekus is green, and his holy symbol is that of a crocodile.
