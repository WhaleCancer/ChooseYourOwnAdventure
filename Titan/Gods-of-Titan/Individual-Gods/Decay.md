The brother of [Disease](Disease.md), Decay is the lord of all that rots and perishes, and also known as Urgulla or the Scavenger. He is worshipped by beggars, especially at the city of Shakuru, and plague victims. Decay has some Priests, known as Acolytes of Decay, as well as a following of several obscure creatures including Awkmutes or Gnolls.

Decay is unusual in that there are no permanent Temples dedicated to him. Instead, the cults that worship this awful God utilise half collapsed and decaying building, either in cities and towns or in the wilderness. These half-collapsed buildings will crumble at a far faster rate whilst they are so used (due to the malign influence of Decay) and will be abandoned when they are a pile of disintegrating rubble!

The Idol of Decay, made from Khulian jade, is a powerful artefact that curses the lands about it with famine and rot. Decay is usually depicted as a festering skeleton, often with a halo of flies. The symbol is a skeletal hand and his Priests wear bone white. Holy days of Decay include the 14th of Dark.
