## Demigod of Chaos

**Specific Power:** Animal Command

The Priest will never be attacked by animals of the type they serve and may communicate freely with animals of that type. In this case, the command is limited to various tentacled Chaos creatures such as Chaos Spawn, Lurking Horrors, the Tantaflex, Tentacled Things, and the Tentallus.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Curse
- Shape Change

In Rough Guide to the Pit (p42), the Behemoth is described as an Evil Demigod of sea creatures such as crustaceans and molluscs and worshipped by fiends like the Brain Slayers and the Decapi. He is a God of Evil sea monsters and appears as a seething mass of seven suckered tentacles and several clacking crab claws, all emanating out from a gigantic polyp-like central body, and in this form is said to lurk in the deepest darkest abysses of Titan's oceans. His two main spheres of influence are molluscs (such as squid, octopi and Kraken) and crustaceans (such as Giant Crabs); a Priest of the Behemoth will favour one of these two aspects of the Deity.

As such, the Behemoth's holy colour is deep blue and his symbol is either a coiling tentacle or a crab's claw. However, he is also venerated as a more general personification of Chaos Incarnate as well, a disruptor, who works to unbalance the status quo by sowing chaos and discord, believing that only through constant struggle can authority be maintained. In essence, the Behemoth is the enemy of order, of nothingness and all things, confusion, pandemonium, madness and death!

One such example of this belief is the cult known as the Sisters of the Brotherhood, led by the despicable Cardinal Zyn, that is rumoured to haunt the dark alleys and backstreets of fair Salamonis, meeting at the secret House of the Behemoth in the Temple District at midnight (one must knock at the door seventeen times; new initiates must be tested by the Ordeal by Dilemma or face a Chaos Spawn in the Pit of Sacrifice).

Most Temples to Behemoth are secret, especially when located in civilised towns and cities. Rather ironically, they tend to be small, poky and dank rooms, cellars and spaces, and so completely different to the vast Demigod they worship. Even in port towns, where he is slightly more popular, the worship of this God will be banned and so the numbers will be small and the worship will occur wherever there is a hidden space that won't draw a0ention.

In this iteration of Behemoth-worship, the God has the same appearance, but other details are different. The holy colour is red, and there are many symbols including a circle (which signifies both nothingness and all things; the paradox at the heart of Chaos), a person that is both half-male and half-female, and the eight-starred constellation of the Behemoth itself that can be seen in the northern skies. All of these symbols and many more are inscribed on banners and pillars throughout the Temple as well as ta0ooed on the cultists' skin.
