Euthillial is the God of Languages, and another of the Children of [Erillia the Elf Mother](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana) (and known to humans as [Galana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana)), though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than fact. He is the father of the speech of High Elvish and also its junior argot, Low Elvish. He appears as a thin human or Elf, with angular features, wearing a green robe and clutching a scroll.

Priests of Euthillial are expected to have at least basic knowledge of multiple languages, even if it is the ability to say hello, thank you and ask a basic question. The worst faux pas that a Priest of this God can make is to not reply to a greeting in the same language as the greeting itself!

Euthillial is worshipped by all [Elves](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md), but especially those who are students of languages, whether the dialects of Elvish or other sentient creatures. The Spirit of Euthillial was one of three magical Vapours born to Queen Ethilesse of Sti0le Woad. The holy symbol of Euthillial is a scroll, and his sacred colour is green.
