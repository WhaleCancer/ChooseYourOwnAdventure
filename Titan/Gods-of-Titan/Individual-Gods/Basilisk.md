**God of Crawling Monsters**

**Specific Power:** Animal Command

The Priest will never be attacked by animals of the type they serve and may communicate freely with animals of that type. In this instance, this power applies to all Evil creatures such as the Basilisk, the Cockatrice, the Hydra, the Tremlow, and, at the Director's discretion, the Gorgon or the Medusa.

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Shape Change
- Weakness

The Basilisk is the Crawler in Darkness, the Dread Fiend from the Dark Place, appearing as an enormous lizard with burnished bronze scales and the crested head of a gigantic predatory bird.

Unleashed upon Titan during the Deep Night by the [Dark Lords](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md), and also a participant in the First Battle on the side of Evil and Chaos, the Basilisk spawned a bizarre and prolific selection of monstrous sub-creatures, including their lizard-like namesake the Basilisk, the Cockatrice, the Hydra, and the Tremlow, among many other loathsome entities.

Priests who follow the Basilisk are rare, and usually wandering rabid lunatics or failed prophets, scratching out a living in marginal wasteland se0lements such as Zagoula, Shakuru or Alasiyan. Because of the Basilisk's standing and presence at the First Battle, the constellation bearing their name can be seen in the southern skies of Titan. The holy symbol of the Basilisk is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a Basilisk, or a Cockatrice, and their chosen colour is bronze. The Hour of the Basilisk is considered sacred for them as well.
