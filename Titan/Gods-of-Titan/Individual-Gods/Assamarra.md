The Sand Devil will remain present for as many rounds as the Priest's Devotion score or until slain.

Assamarra the God of Sand and Lord of the Desert is an associate Deity of the Earth Goddess [Throff](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#throff), and [Glantanka](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#glantanka) the Sun Goddess (who confusingly is also known as Assamura by the ancient Djaratians). He is typically worshipped by Desert Elves and nomad tribes from arid wastelands like the Desert of Skulls and the Scythera Desert, where he is known as Akhon, and his Priests are known as sufis and able to summon friendly Sand Devils to aid them.

Assamarra is a regal-looking man, bare-chested and wearing a cloth around his waist. He has a tall, cylindrical nine-banded crown and holds a long staff in one hand. Assamarra's holy symbol is a sand dune, and his holy colour is white or yellow.
