## Goddess of the Meadows

**Specific Power:** Leap of Faith

Using this power will enable the Priest or one touched recipient to jump over a wall or across a pit at will, with no chance of slipping or falling. The recipient can jump a horizontal distance equal to quadruple their height, and a vertical distance equal to twice their height. No run-up is required, and carrying a heavy load or wearing armour has no effect on the distance jumped either. This power lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score.

**Or, Animal Command**

The Priest will never be attacked by animals of the type they serve and may communicate freely with animals of that type, which includes rabbits, hares and other leaping mammals.

**General Powers:**

- Create Food and Water
- Sanctuary
- Shape Change

Lepus is an obscure animal Deity, the Goddess of meadows and woodland creatures such as rabbits, hares, Hoppers, Jib-Jibs, Fenzels, and other similar jumping rodent-like creatures. She is associated with [Sindla](Sindla.md), Goddess of Luck, and [Logaan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan) the Trickster God, and because of this, the fourteenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Rabbit.

Lepus is also worshipped by Leprechauns and Nikrechauns, some of whom may have a rabbit or similar creature as a Familiar. The holy symbol of Lepus is a rabbit's foot, and her sacred colour is brown.
