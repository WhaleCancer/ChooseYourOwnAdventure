Vermistra is the Queen of Snakes and appears as an immense python that reputedly dwells at the heart of the thickest, most remote jungles of Titan. She has a small following among snake-like races such as the Caarth, Justrali and Kassistra.

There are certain mystics and hermits that devote their lives to Vermistra. Some live deep in the jungle or desert, surrounded every day by very many snakes. Others live in towns or cities, carrying with them a basket of snakes that are used to entertain the masses. This earns a few coins to enable the mystic to eat, but they also secretly hope that this increased familiarity might reduce the hatred for these reptiles that most common people feel. Despite these mystics having a presence in towns for very many years, they seem to be making li0le progress.

Because of Vermistra's standing, the third year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Snake. Her immortal son [Sussussurr](Sussussurr.md) is a beloved pet of the Snake Demon [Sith](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sith). Vermistra's sacred colours are red and gold and her symbol is that of a rearing cobra. The Hour of the Serpent is considered holy for Vermistra.
