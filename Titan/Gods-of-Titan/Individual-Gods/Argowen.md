Argowen is the God of Trees and appears as a tall, broad, craggy, moss-encrusted oak tree, that may take gigantic humanoid form at times and stroll the paths that cross the Garden of the Gods. Argowen is one of the many Children of [Erillia the Elf Mother](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana) (and known to humans as [Galana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana)), though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than fact.

The Temples of Argowen are not built; rather they are grown from trees native to that area. The Priests will use their Powers to boost the growth of the seedlings and saplings and carefully train the growing plants into the correct shape. A small Shrine will have four or five small trees interwoven but a great Temple could have hundreds of great oaks forming a vast hall, side chambers, and even upper floors!

He is worshipped by [Elves](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md), Fairies and all other Fey Folk who celebrate the joys of nature, as well as by the Wodewose (who know him as the Lord of the Forest), and Tree Men who tend the forest as shepherds look after sheep. The holy colour of Argowen is green, and his symbol is that of an oak leaf.
