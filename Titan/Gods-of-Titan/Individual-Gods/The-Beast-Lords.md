## Patron Gods of Each Specific Animal Type

**Specific Power:** Animal Command

The Priest will never be attacked by, and may communicate freely with, animals of the type they serve (both normal and giant-sized versions of that animal).

**General Powers:**

- Shape Change
- Commune
- Heal

There are numerous Beast Lords, each the essence of one specific animal type. The senior Beast Lord is [Kilanirax](Kilanirax.md), Lord of the Dragons, and there is a strict hierarchy. The Beast Lords are generally little worshipped by humans, although some of the non-human races worship these Gods.

Examples of Beast Lords include:

- [Arhallogen](Arhallogen.md) - God of Spiders
- [Hmurresh](Hmurresh.md) - Goddess of Flies
- [Kilanirax](Kilanirax.md) - Lord of the Dragons
