## Goddess of Flowers

**Specific Power:** Bloom of Beauty

Through the distracting appearance of beautiful flowers or the heady scent of their pollen, the Priest will cause the mind of one target within 5m to become severely confused. The effects will last for one Attack Round for every two full points of the Priest's Devotion score, and each round must roll 1d6 and consult the following table to find out what action they will take:

| Roll | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Target attacks Priest. |
| 2 | Target attacks own friends or allies. |
| 3 | Target attacks random opponent. |
| 4 | Target dithers and does nothing. |
| 5 | Target flees for one round. |
| 6 | Target may choose their own actions. |

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Create Food and Water
- Heal

The Goddess of Flowers appears a pale wisp, a female Elven or Fairy woman, with butterfly wings, fluttering among the riotously many-coloured petals of her offspring as they bloom. Aëgraven is one of the many Children of Erillia the Elf Mother (and known to humans as [Galana](Galana.md)), though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than fact.

She is worshipped by Elves, Fairies and all other Fey Folk who celebrate the joys of nature. The holy colour of Aëgraven is pink, and her symbol is that of a flower.
