Durrak the Dog God fought on the side of Good during the First Battle, alongside [Achilla](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#achilla) the Hunter and [Fourga](Fourga.md), God of Pride (who shares Durrak's symbol), against Durrak's elder brother, the Wolf Lord [Almor](Almor.md), and [Urk](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#urk) the Orc Champion. He takes the form of a powerful, muscular hound, such as a Mastiff or Ro0weiler, with a gleaming coat and glowing red eyes.

There are no significant Temples on Titan to Durrak, but in the bigger cities there are usually several smaller Shrines. These can often be easy to spot by the casual visitor due to the large numbers of wild dogs that frequent the place!

Durrak is paid homage by those who work with dogs, such as hound-masters, rat-catchers and truffle hunters, as well as the winged Canidors, and the strange race of dog-headed creatures known as Blogs from the forests of central Allansia. His holy colour is brown, and his symbol is a dog. Because of Durrak's standing, the twelfth-year in the twenty year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Dog. Likewise, the Hour of the Jackal is considered sacred for Durrak.
