Kyrile is the Goddess of Gems and Jewels and the daughter of [Throff](Throff.md) the Earth Goddess. As a result she is venerated by Dwarfs, as well as the Skorn, who consider her their primary Deity, the glimmering light in the darkness that led them from captivity at the hands of the Evil N'yadach people. Curiously, there is a peculiar surface sect called the Cult of Light Worshippers, that are an offshoot of Kyrile followers. These Light Worshippers pay homage to the Goddess in the form of a giant glowing crystal that emits beams of dancing light and are typically drawn from the smaller of Titan's races, primarily Halflings, Chervah and Gnomes. In Dwarf and Skorn myths, Kyrile appears as a Dwarf woman, clad in a gleaming cape of jewels, with an enormous green gemstone in the centre of her forehead.

She is said to dwell on the Elemental Plane of Earth in a palace carved from a gargantuan emerald. Her sacred colour is light green and her holy symbol is that of an eight-sided emerald. Followers of Kyrile typically wear a type of minor magical jewel or crystal around their neck, as a Holy Symbol of their faith.
