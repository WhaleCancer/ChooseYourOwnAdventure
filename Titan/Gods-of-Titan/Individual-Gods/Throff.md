**The Earth Goddess**

**Specific Power:** Throff's Quaking

The Priest may cause a small and localised earthquake, with exactly the same effects as the Wizardry spell Earthquake although this power will only last for 10 seconds or so. Thus victims who are swallowed up by cracks or knocked down may recover on the A0ack Round after the earthquake stops.

**General Powers:**

- Create Food and Water
- Heal
- Sanctuary

Sister to [Galana](Galana.md) and the daughter of [Titan](Titan.md) and [Glantanka](Glantanka.md), Throff is a major Goddess and the Patron Goddess of the [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md). Other names for Throff include Alishanka and the Earth-mother, while [Elves](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) name her as Elluviel. In most of the creation myths Throff was the creator of the world of Titan.

Once the wife of [Hydana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana), God of the Waters, they had three sons together: [Atlan](Atlan.md), [Aqualis](Aqualis.md) and [Farigiss](Farigiss.md). With her second husband [Filash](Filash.md), she is the mother of [Verlang](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#verlang) and [Lorodil](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#lorodil). She is usually depicted as a beautiful lady, wearing silver robes and adorned with jewellery made from the finest precious metals.

As well as the Cathedral in Fangthane, other centres of Throff worship include Daddu-Yadu in Kakhabad, the Crucible Island and in the Invisible City on the Plain of Bronze.

Her Priests wear robes of silver and have a diamond as their symbol. The Allansian month of Unlocking is dedicated to her, as well as the season of Autumn, and Earthday in Allansia and the Old World, and Lifeday in Khul. Holy days of Throff include the 2nd of Dark and the 4th of Locking.
