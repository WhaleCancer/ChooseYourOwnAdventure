## God and Incarnation of Disease

**Specific Power:** Touch of Disease

A Priest of Disease may cause one touched target to start suffering from a debilitating disease. Each day, including the day of infection, the target must roll on the following table and immediately apply the effects to the appropriate Characteristics. These losses are permanent until the disease is cured. The target receives no Test for Luck, and normal medicine cannot heal this disease, although the Cure Disease power of another Priest will work. If not cured, the target shall surely die.

**Roll** | **Disease Effect**
1 | -1 SKILL
2-4 | -2 STAMINA
5 | -1 MAGIC (or PSIONICS or LUCK)
6 | -1 LUCK

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Smite versus Good races
- Weakness

The Festering Lord, as Disease is also known (as well as Voma and Krur), is worshipped in southern areas of Khul, by people such as the Sickness Priests of Shakuru, and his acolytes can be found elsewhere in Titan, including the Blood Cults of Bathoria. Disease is typically depicted as a deformed man, covered in virulent sores. His colour is pus yellow, and his symbol is a maggot. In Khul, the month of Sun's Hiding is dedicated to Disease.
