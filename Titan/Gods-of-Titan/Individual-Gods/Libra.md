The Patron Goddess of Analand in the Old World, and several other nations, Libra is a major Goddess who represents truth and justice. She stands for all that is right and just, and like her mother [Sindla](Sindla.md), is known by different names across Titan, including Sicalla, Bersten, Lissamina, Macalla, and Mhaath in ancient Djarat.

Libra is typically depicted as a beautiful woman holding the Scales of Justice, and her largest centres of worship on Titan include the monasteries that line the shores of Lake Libra, the Halls of Justice in Fang, the Cathedral of Libra in Crystal City, and Kallamehr's enormous Statue of Justice (which shows her as a robed woman holding an upright sword in each hand). A statue of Libra guards the mysterious Water of the Gods in the Starstone Caves of northern Allansia.

Her symbol is a pair of scales, and her Priests wear grey. Holy days of Libra include the 23rd of Dark, the 10th of Winds, and the 4th of Fire.
