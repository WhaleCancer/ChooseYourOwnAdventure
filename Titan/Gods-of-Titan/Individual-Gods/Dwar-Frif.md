Dwar Frif the Dwarf Lord was the leader of [Throff](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#throff)'s [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) and fought on the side of Good during the First Battle, clad in mithril chainmail while wearing a golden winged helmet and wielding an enormous silver battleaxe. He passed away not long afterwards, still suffering from the terrible wounds inflicted upon him.

It is wri0en that Throff herself elevated him to the Heavens as a Demigod. The constellation bearing the Dwarf Lord's name can be seen in the northern night skies because of his courage during the First Battle. Dwar Frif is the Patron God of Dwarf Warriors, of Tunnel Fighters, and of Bane-Reavers, and all who heed the call to arms when Dwarf strongholds are overrun with Orcs and worse. His holy symbol is a double-bladed battle axe, and his sacred colour is orange.
