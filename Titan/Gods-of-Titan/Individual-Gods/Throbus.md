**The Portal God**

**Specific Power:** Open Portal

When the Priest recites the mystical words: "I bid you portal open wide!" They may touch any door, gateway, chest, lock, window or chained object that may be closed or locked, and cause it to open immediately, allowing access for the Priest. This includes anything that has been magically locked, including unique structures such as Throben Doors or the North Gate of the cityport of Kharé. If used on a teleportation portal or device, allow the Priest to Teleport to wherever they choose, as long as they have been there before. This power can be used once per day and lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score; they may use it on multiple structures during this period.

**General Powers:**

- Banish
- Commune
- Ward

Throbus is the God of Portals, the Lord of the Open Door. Venerated especially in the holy city of Throben (which is actually named after the God), Throbus is considered to be a neutral God and possibly kin to [Vlada](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#vlada), God of Trade.

Known by the [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) as Berelendûin, Master of the Stone Gate (and to the ancient Djaratians as T'lobye), the Portal God is usually depicted as a bearded human or Dwarf in blue robes, holding a hammer in one hand and an iron bell or key in the other.

Throbus is the arch-enemy of [The Malice](The-Malice.md), the God of the Black Door, whose servants the Brain Slayers make portals of Evil in The Malice's honour; Priests of Throbus seek out these arcane gateways and destroy them where possible! The symbol of Throbus is a key, and his holy colour is blue.
