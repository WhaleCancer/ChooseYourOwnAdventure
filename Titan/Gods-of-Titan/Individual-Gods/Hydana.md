Brother of [Sukh](Sukh.md) and [Pangara](Pangara.md), Hydana is the third of the elemental brothers and God of the Waters. It was Hydana who created the oceans during the birth of the world and Hydana who released the tidal wave that destroyed Atlantis. The first husband of [Throff](Throff.md), Hydana retreated from the Celestial Court after the First Battle, and resides in the deeps of the oceans to this day. He is usually depicted as a powerful blue or green-skinned man with a fish's tail, wielding a trident and a net, and one of his most legendary places of worship is the Sunken Temple on the edge of Devilfish Rift, near Blackcoral Reef among the waters of the treacherous Eelsea.

Hydana is particularly worshipped by the aquatic races such as Fish People and Merfolk, although he is also revered in coastal ports. His Priests wear light blue robes and bear the symbol of a trident. For more information about Hydana in his role as one of the planets in the skies of Titan, see Chapter 4.

In the Allansian reckoning of time, the month of Sowing is sacred to Hydana as the provider of water, as well as Seaday in both Allansia and the Old World. Holy days of Hydana (who is sometimes mistakenly called Hydrana) include the 25th of Winds and the 21st of Close, as well as the Festival of the Waters, which begins on the 5th of Unlocking.
