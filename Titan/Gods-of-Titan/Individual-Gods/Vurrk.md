Vurrk is the spirit of the swamp and Lord of the Marsh Wraiths, as worshipped by Marsh Goblins and other inhuman tribes that dwell in those fly infested wetlands.

The ancient Djaratians knew him as M'stanque, and believed he dwelt on the mystical plane known as the Swamps of the Primordial Mire. Vurrk takes the form of a gigantic humanoid figure made entirely of dripping mud and slime, staring balefully at the world with glowing golden eyes. His sacred colours are green and brown and his symbol is a bulrush.
