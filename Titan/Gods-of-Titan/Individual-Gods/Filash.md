The brother of [Glantanka](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#glantanka), Goddess of the sun, Filash embodies heat, fire and flame. Partner of [Throff](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#throff) the Earth Goddess, their children include the Forge God [Verlang](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#verlang), and [Lorodil](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#lorodil), God of volcanoes. Worshipped across Titan (there was a particularly splendid Temple in the Allansian town of Silverton), Filash is sometimes known by different names, including Akkalladûn, Tereb, Khrizat and Shazeel.

Some of his followers are known as Firemasters and are itinerant wanderers peddling magical Fire Rocks and the like. Five sacred idols to Filash are found in cities across the Ximoran Protectorate. Filash is typically depicted as an orange-skinned man, radiating flames, heat and smoke, and is said to dwell in the Citadel of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire. His Priests wear orange robes and his symbol is a stylised flame. For more information about Filash in his role as one of the planets in the skies of Titan, see Chapter 4.

The Allansian month of Fire and the Khulian month of Forests Golden are holy to Filash, likewise the season of Summer, Fireday in both Allansia and the Old World, and the Hour of the Phoenix at dawn. Holy days of Filash include the 11th of Hiding.
