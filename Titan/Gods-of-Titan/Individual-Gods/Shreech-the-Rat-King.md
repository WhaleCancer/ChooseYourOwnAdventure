Shreech the Rat King is the God of rats and brother to the Mouse God [Kareep](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kareep). He is also a companion to the Dark Lords of [Disease](Disease.md) and [Decay](Decay.md) and appears as a gigantic rat with a rusted iron crown upon his head.

The Rat King is worshipped by a variety of creatures, including Troglodytes, Rat Men, Bograts, Wererats, and some disgusting human acolytes who dwell within the stinking sewers of large ancient cities.

Priests of Shreech wear ta0ered brown robes and are often accompanied by several rodent pets. The symbol of Shreech is a rat, and the Hour of the Rat is considered sacred for him as well.
