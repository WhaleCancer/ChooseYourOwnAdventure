**Father of the World**

**Specific Power:** Great Lord of BaEle and Madness

When the Priest uses this power, they imbue either themselves or one touched target with berserk strength that will flow in their veins. They may add 1 point to their SKILL score for their next combat only, add 1 to any armour rolls and also inflict Double Damage with each successful hit. However, they may not flee the battle, and must fight to the death, either theirs or that of their opponent(s).

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Bravery

Titan is the Father of the World, the Lord of the Gods, leader of the Celestial Court, and winner of the First Battle against the [Dark Lords](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md)' forces of Chaos and Evil.

He is "elder statesman" of the all the Gods and takes the appearance of an old but muscular man, with a benevolent smile playing on his lips but a stern look in his deep brilliant-blue eyes. Few worship Titan, but all who know of him offer pleas for his blessing almost as commonly as they entreat his sister, [Sindla](Sindla.md), for good luck. He also has many children who are Gods, such as [Galana](Galana.md), [Throff](Throff.md), and, in some cultures, [Hamaskis](Hamaskis.md), while other nations know [Glantanka](Glantanka.md) as the wife of Titan and call her Mother of the World.

Titan is worshipped primarily by most races of Giants, for he created them as one of the original five types of people on Titan alongside humans, [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), [Elves](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) and the mysterious Fifth Race. He is venerated by the Titans themselves, obscure folk named in his honour, and also in some distant corners of the three continents.

For example, in the Ximoran Protectorate, Titan is known as Oiden, and there is still a functioning Temple dedicated to his worship in the town of Neuburg (whose initiates practice the Ordeal of the White Tree), while among the northern nations of the Old World he is known as the Horned God, and in the city of Salamonis in central Allansia there is the landmark of Titan Square complete with a colossal statue of the Father God.

There are no great Temples to Titan because few have him as their primary Patron Deity, but there are some Shrines, especially in the palaces and castles of Kings and Nobles, who see him as the "King of the Gods" and unofficially consider him the Patron God of Rulers. These private Shrines will have their own Priest but will be for the personal use of the Lord or King and their family. There will usually be expensive gem-encrusted statues and fine cloth in the Shrine, as surely the King of the Gods would appreciate wealth and fine things?

The holy colour of Titan is white, and his symbol is that of a tree's trunk and branches, spread out and devoid of leaves. The Allansian month of Locking is dedicated to Titan, as is Highday in Allansia and the Old World, and Rageday in Khul. Holy days of Titan include the 27th of Locking.
