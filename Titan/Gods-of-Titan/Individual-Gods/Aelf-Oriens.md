## The Elven Prince

**Specific Power:** Raging of the Light

Using this power, the Priest may imbue themselves with a glowing fury against all Evil creatures. In a battle against any innately Evil creatures (such as Demons or Undead), the Priest gains a +1 bonus to all combat rolls, while the opponents suffer a -1 penalty, such is their dismay at facing a Priest of the Elven Light! This power can be used once per day, for as many Attack Rounds as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Protection versus Orcs
- Ward

Revered by High Elves as a doomed messiah, Aëlf Oriens the Elf Prince was the brother of [Téla Oriens](Tela-Oriens.md) the White Lord and fought for Good during the First Battle. Unfortunately he was slain during the fighting, some say by [Urk Wolfrider](Urk-Wolfrider.md) the Orc Champion and [Almor](Almor.md) the Wolf God, but deified as a hero, and the constellation bearing his name can be seen in the southern skies of Titan.

Temples to Aëlf Oriens are often temporary, raised in times of great need and when danger threatens the Elves, showing that at the times of greatest threat, Heroes arise to meet that need.

Aëlf Oriens appears as a tall and heroic Elf warrior in silver armour and armed with a silver sword and shield. He is venerated by all Elves who fight on the side of Good as a paragon of Elvish heroism. The holy colour of Aëlf Oriens is silver, and his symbol is a silver shield.
