Hunnynhaa is the Stallion God, the lord of all horses, ponies, mules, zebras and other single-toed herbivorous ungulates. He is a member of the Animal Court, and revered especially by Centaurs, who consider themselves horses cursed to suffer the indignity of a sluggish human upper-body, and various Nomad tribesmen from the flatland steppes on all three continents. Hunnynhaa is almost always depicted as a graceful yet powerful black stallion, as fast as the wind with hooves like thunder, endlessly galloping through the Macrocosmos.

Because he fought alongside [Silvermane](Silvermane.md) the Centaur Hero during the First Battle, the twentieth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Horse. The holy symbol of Hunnynhaa is, of course, a rearing stallion, and his sacred colour depends on the type of land his believers inhabit.

In northern climates, whether woodlands, hills or steppes, the blessed colour is brown, whereas in deserts and arid hills it is orange, and in the blisteringly hot southern savannas it is stripes of black and white, all obviously based on the typical colour of Hunnynhaa's wild equine children that live in these different terrains. The Hour of the Horse is considered holy for Hunnynhaa.
