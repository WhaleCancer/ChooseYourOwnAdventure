"On Courga's face you kiss across
And finish with the lips
For answers to your questions you
Must err not else me spits"
- Kissing Ritual of Courga, Khare, Cityport of Traps"

The daughter of [Usrel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#usrel), and rather confusingly also the wife of her brother, [Fourga](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#fourga), Courga is a minor Goddess of physical and personal grace. Other names for Courga include Tuanar, Kirilin and Nureya. In Kharé, the Cityport of Traps, Courga's idol allows worshippers to Commune with the Goddess but only if they first successfully complete the Kissing Ritual of Courga (unsuccessful a0empts at the Ritual result in death).

Her Priests are always graceful in their actions and words. Courga is also the mother of [Telak](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#telak). Priests of Courga have no standard dress but do have the symbol of a cat. In Khul, the month of Days Lengthen is dedicated to Courga. Holy days of Courga include the 16th of Unlocking.
