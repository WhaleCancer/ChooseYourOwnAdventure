Alongside [Varantar](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#varantar) the Shepherd, Cholumbara is another agricultural Deity and either a child of [Galana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana) or a minor God under her protection. She is worshipped as the Patron Demigod of all farmers and those involved in various kinds of sedentary agriculture such as growing crops, tending to orchards, or working as apiarists. Cholumbara, as she is known in Khul, is traditionally depicted as a tall red-haired woman with dark green robes and a crown of apple leaves.

In the Old World Cholumbara becomes the Ploughman, a ruddy-cheeked individual with muddy clothes and a smoking pipe, while in Allansia they are called Limmannin and a two-day seasonal feast is held every year in their honour, beginning on the night of the first harvest (typically the 23rd of Watching).

The holy symbol of Cholumbara is an apple, and their sacred colour is dark green. In Allansia and the Old World, the month of Reaping is sacred to Cholumbara.
