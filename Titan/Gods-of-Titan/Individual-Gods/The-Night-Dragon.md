Before the First Battle, when [Death](Death.md) and his shadowy cohorts wandered across Titan, the [Dark Lords](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md) managed to corrupt one of the Dragon King [Kilanirax](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kilanirax)'s most powerful lieutenants, who became the Night Dragon – the Ancient One – an incredibly old and Evil creature. Once subdued after the First Battle, it has slumbered somewhere in northern Allansia, in an immense crypt built specifically to house and imprison such a monster.

"More powerful than the Old Ones!" say the members of the Conclave of the Dragons and they are not wrong, describing a Demigod that measures forty metres from nose to tail, with a wingspan of perhaps double that, covered in black scaly skin that shimmers with silver and blue iridescence. Blue flames play about its mouth, while everywhere are the signs of Chaos-taint; skin either hangs in folds or is too tight, and various yellow bones protrude.

The secretive Cult of the Night Dragon is particularly active in northern Allansia, and divided into different castes, with grey robes designating a lower grade, and black or red a higher one. The sacred colour of the Night Dragon is black, and their holy symbol is a silver dragon skull on a spider's web. The Hour of the Wyvern is considered sacred for the Night Dragon.
