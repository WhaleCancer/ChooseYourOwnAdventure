## Mistress Fate

**Specific Power:** Reveal Destiny

This power allows the Priest to see brief scenes from the near future of either themselves or one known person. The future in this case is no more than two days, and the visions are often confusing and obscure. The visions are of events that will probably happen, but intervening events may change this. The length of the visions is the same number of minutes as the Priest's Devotion score. This power often presents problems for the Director, as he will be required to predict what will happen…

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Commune
- Heal

In northern Allansia, from Zengis to the cold northeastern lands of Frostholm, these doughty folk judge the Powers of [Sindla](Sindla.md) over Luck and Fate are too great to ascribe to one Deity alone. Thus Sindla becomes Lady Luck, and they worship another Goddess too, a lesser avatar of Sindla called Mistress Fate or Zorna.

Indeed, "By Zorna's Eyes!" is a commonly sworn oath by northern Allansians when confronted with extremely good or bad luck. Zorna takes the form of a beautiful woman or girl, wearing purple robes and carrying a crystal orb.

She is believed to be the Goddess that dictates one's fate, that nudges the dice one way or another. Some consider her the go-between twixt Sindla and the Trickster Gods, a Sentinel Goddess, a Deity of Eyes, who watches the Endless Balance between Good and Evil, who monitors and reports. The holy symbol of Zorna is a crystal ball and her sacred colour is purple.
