## The Khulian God of Storms

**Specific Power:** Runes of the Storm God

The Priest uses this power, which resides in the mystic runes inscribed on them during the Test of the Flame at their initiation, to summon the power of the storm. Each round, every enemy in metal armour will be struck with a small lightning bolt, inflicting 2 STAMINA damage. This mini-storm will last for a number of rounds equal to Devotion.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Create Food and Water
- Sanctuary

The dramatic appearance of the Kukulak worshipping Lord Azzur in Port Blacksand and subsequent founding of a Temple to the Khulian "other" God of Storms, when there was already a grand church of [Sukh](Sukh.md) present, has caused some consternation among the God-watchers and Deity interpreters of Allansia. Initially, it was assumed that Kukulak was just a Khulian name for Sukh, but the differences in worship are so great many have now concluded Kukulak is a separate demiurge from Sukh, like [Electron](Electron.md) and [Thyra Migurn](Thyra-Migurn.md).

However, Kukulak went rogue, fighting against his fellows in the First Battle, aiding and abetting the forces of Evil and Chaos. Regardless, Kukulak worship is now entrenched in Port Blacksand, but also in northern Khul among cities like Arion and Corda. The Priests are swathed in thick black robes that cover the branded runes they suffer during the Test of the Flame, when undergoing a successful initiation (unsuccessful initiates are sacrificed to the God). The symbol of Kukulak is a stylised black flame.
