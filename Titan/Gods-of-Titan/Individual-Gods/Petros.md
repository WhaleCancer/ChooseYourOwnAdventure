**The Shadow God**

**Specific Power:** Shadowplay

The Priest can summon a swirling mass of shadows that creates a five-metre radius circle of absolute inky darkness centred around them. The area of darkness will not move, and will cancel out both normal light and the Dark Seeing Talent. The darkness can be cancelled by a Light spell or a Counterspell, but will otherwise last for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion spell. Needless to say, the Priest can see perfectly well in the shadowy darkness!

**General Powers:**

- Cure Poison and Disease
- Smite versus everybody
- Weakness

[Logaan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan) the Trickster God is typically depicted with two shadowy accomplices called [Kata](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kata) and Petros. What few realise is that these mysterious entities are Demigods in their own right. Petros, Logaan's left "hand", for example, is the God of Assassins, Ninjas and other cults of the night; the Shadow Lord, often invoked by hired killers across Titan but never explicitly named, for fear of bringing misfortune to a hit or other delicate, or not-so-delicate, "operation".

The more devout Assassins' Guilds in larger cities may even have a small shrine to Petros at which assassins can make offerings before or after a hopefully successful "quiet job". It is often mistakenly assumed that Kata and Petros represent Logaan being pulled in the direction of Good or Evil, when in fact both Demigods reflect the two choices of true Neutrality, inaction or avoidance, in the case of Kata, and direct action or reaction for Petros. The sacred colour of Petros is black, and their symbol takes the form of an arrow.
