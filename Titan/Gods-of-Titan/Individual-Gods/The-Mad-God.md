## The Many-Eyed Being from Beyond the Portal of Evil

**Specific Power:** Mirror of the Mad God

Once per day the Priest of the Mad God can summon an identical copy of one combat opponent. The copy will have the opponent's SKILL and STAMINA score, as well as the same weapon and armour. However, the copy will have no LUCK score or magical spells, and its weapon and armour will be normal items of their type. It will last until slain, or for a number of rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion, and is completely under the control of the Priest who summoned it.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Commune
- Incite

The Mad God is an ancient and obscure Deity from southern Khul, once worshipped by both Goblins and humans alike. Its Goblin form is that of a gargantuan eight-armed Goblin, armed with swords and whose skin is completely covered in the shards of broken mirrors. Its human form is a mighty black shadowy giant with one hundred gleaming eyes.

Some theologians consider that the Mad God is not especially Evil, just misunderstood, particularly by other Priests suspicious of the God's connection with the elder Goblin civilisations of this region. His colour is silver and his symbol is a mirror.

When ancient and forgotten Temples to the Mad God are discovered by explorers and Heroes, the main chamber is normally found to be clean and tidy, often with fresh torches burning in the sconces. This is the case even if the Temple has been sealed off by a rockfall or other disaster!
