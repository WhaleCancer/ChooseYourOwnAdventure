Nyctule is the Lord of Bats and fought on the side of Evil during the First Battle, alongside the [Gargoyle](Gargoyle.md), [Hmurresh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hmurresh), and others.

Also known somewhat peculiarly as Zo_, he takes the form of a giant bat, with an oddly human-like face and eyes of red fire.

Nyctule is paid homage by Hags, Werebats, Lifesuckers, Vampires, Nosferatu, and the Groan, and is particularly venerated in some of the more infamous principalities of Mauristatia, including Mortvania and Vannan.

Because of Nyctule's standing, the ninth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Bat. The Bat-Axe was created in the image of Nyctule by an unknown [Demon Prince](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#demon-princes) (see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p145). His holy colour is black, and his symbol is a bat.
