Rikat the God of Scorpions is cousin to [Arhallogen](Arhallogen.md) the Spider God, and manifests as a gigantic bronze scorpion, surrounded by an army of half-human, half-scorpion demonic warriors known as the Accursed. Rikat is venerated in lands where scorpions are common, such as arid deserts and dense jungles.

Priests of Rikat are rare; those who do follow the Scorpion God wear dark brown robes, with a scorpion-shaped brooch pinned to the front. These scorpion brooches often have magical Powers (see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p122).

There is said to be a large abandoned Temple to Rikat in the Dead City in southern Khul. Decorated with scorpion statues and friezes, there are huge numbers of scorpions roaming the dust-covered floors, but at the back of the main hall is a huge open archway leading down to a subterranean chamber. Rumour has it that a Giant Scorpion bigger than a house lurks in that underground lair waiting for the return of the Priests and the sacrifices they provided!
