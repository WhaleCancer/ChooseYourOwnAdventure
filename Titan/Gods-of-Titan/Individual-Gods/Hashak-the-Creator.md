## Father of Orcs, Goblins and Trolls

**Specific Power:** Create Life

During combat this power lasts for as many Attack Rounds as the Priest's Devotion score; outside of combat it lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score. The Priest may cause all inanimate non-living objects within 5m to become animated hindering enemies of the Priest. The effect will vary with the number of objects in the affected area but will cause all enemies within this area to suffer a penalty to any and all physical actions, including combat.

A dusty cloud of motes may induce a penalty of -1 as it blinds and gets up one's nose, while a hail of large rocks could cause a penalty as high as -5. In addition, if this power is applied by touch instead to a single large inanimate object that is roughly man-sized or smaller, that object will animate to become a protective guardian entity. Below is a table showing common large objects and what they can be animated into.

| Roll | Object | SKILL | STAMINA | Damage |
|------|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Whip | @ | @ | Whip |
| 2 | Armour | ? | ? | Axe |
| 3 | Weapon | ? | ? | Tool |
| 4 | Rope | + | + | 1d6+1 |
| 5 | Furniture | Improv | Improv | Improv |

@ - Does not take damage and attacks for one battle  
? - As appropriate  
+ - Entangles enemy and applies a -2 penalty to all actions

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Incite
- Smite versus non-Orcs, Goblins and Trolls

Hashak the Creator (sometimes known as Halack, Father of Orcs) was originally a Demigod serving [Throff](Throff.md), who generally appears as a gnarled and stunted Hill Giant with large tusks (although other depictions are known), possibly assigned by [Titan](Titan.md) to help the Earth Goddess with her work.

As we all now know, Hashak "borrowed" some magical clay and used it to create the three races during the Godtime who became the Orcs, Goblins and Trolls (although there are often violent disputes between individuals of the three races as to the exact order of creation).

It should be noted that Hashak is not necessarily an Evil Deity, but rather his children were infected with Chaos by the Dark Lords. Thus, while Orcs, Goblins and Trolls may now worship Evil Gods, demons and spirits, many of their Shamans still dedicate themselves to preaching the word of Hashak the Creator, their prime progenitor Deity.

The holy symbol of Hashak are two tusks (points facing upwards and outwards and crossed to form an X), and his sacred colour is brown. Holy days of Hashak include the 6th of Freeze and the entire Orcish New Year festival of Urguz.

There are few large Temples to Hashak, and those that do exist tend to be built deep below ground in vast caverns by tribes of Goblins and Orcs. On the surface, they tend instead to be small Shrines, crudely constructed from branches, thatch and sheets of leather. They will normally have little inside other than a carved statue of the God standing upon a tree stump or crude table. The Priest will normally sleep in the Shrine to ensure the safety of the statue.
