**The Gargoyle God**

**Specific Power:** Stone Meld

When using this power, the Priest has the ability to move through stone, rock, earth, mud, or sand as if it were air. This power lasts for as many A0ack Rounds as the Priest's Devotion score, and when it runs out, they had be0er be clear of any substrate otherwise they will be crushed to death. It works on metal, crystal, and glass surfaces for half of this duration. It will not work on wood, fabric, ice, water, lava or magma. It also applies to equipment that the Priest carries, but does not transfer to a carried person.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Smite versus non-flying enemies
- Weakness

The Gargoyle God is a paradox, being both the God of flying monsters such as Gargoyles, Harpies, Vultures and other scavengers, and even [Sukh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sukh)-loving Life-Stealers (who pay him covert allegiance), and also stone-affiliated terrors including Gorgons and Medusae. He roamed the skies of Titan when [Death](Death.md) walked the world and fought on the side of Evil during the First Battle.

Even today one thousand Gargoyles serve in fealty to the [Demon Prince](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#demon-princes) Vradna, in his great storm-wracked palace on the Demonic Plane of Platinum. Because of the Gargoyle's standing, the constellation bearing his name can also be seen in the northern skies of Titan.

The holy symbol of the Gargoyle God is the visage of a gargoyle or a vulture, and his sacred colour is grey. The Hour of the Gargoyle is considered holy for him as well.
