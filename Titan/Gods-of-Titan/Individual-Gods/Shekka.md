**Goddess of Witchcraft**

**Specific Power:** Shekka's Witcher

Once per day, the Priest may be gifted with some of the power of Witchcraft (more fully explained in the Magic Companion). The Priest can use the power of Cursing on one target, although it is more limited than that of actual Witches. The Priest can reduce SKILL, LUCK and MAGIC by one each on a single target within earshot, although the target does have a Test for LUCK to avoid the Curse.

The Priest can lift a curse at any time just by willing it, but they can only have a number of active curses equal to their Devotion score at any one time.

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Ill-Luck
- Weakness

Shekka is the ancient Evil Goddess of witchcraft, sometimes known as the Dark Goddess or Nanagga, and is usually depicted as a wretched crone with long nails, green skin and red eyes. She is worshipped by a wide variety of groups including sorceresses, witches, warlocks, Hags, Sirens, and secret societies such as the Cauldron of Midnight (which is active in Ruddlestone). Shekka's Moon is a blood-red crescent-shaped moon that rises once every 37 years (see Chapter 4).

Her symbol is Shekka's Rune, or the Witch's Mark; three crossed lines forming an inverted triangle. Another symbol of hers is the crescent moon, which is often inscribed upon amulets and the like. The sacred colours of Shekka are red and black.
