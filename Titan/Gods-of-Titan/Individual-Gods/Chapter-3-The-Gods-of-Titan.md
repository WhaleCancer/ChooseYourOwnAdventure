## 
The Gods of Titan are a wide and expansive pantheon of deities and Demigods, and most of these divinities were first described in the master work Titan (p26-31, 45-47, 66-69, 70-75).

The Priesthoods for the major Gods were subsequently detailed in the AFF rulebook (p91-98),
which listed the thirty most popular Gods of Good,
Neutral and Evil alignments. The Rough Guide to
the Pit (p42-49), weighed in on the Evil end of the
cosmic scales of balance, and listed a further twenty-
two Evil deities and Demigods drawn from the dark
side of Titan’s varied pantheon.
Likewise, this book, Gods of Titan, expands on these
options by providing details on all of these plus more;
132 different Gods, deities, entities and Demigods.
Taken from Titan and other more obscure gamebook
sources, this section provides plenty for a Priest to
choose from, from Good and Neutral Gods for
Heroes and NPCs to worship, as well as sundry Evil
and Chaos divinities for villains to follow, or
characters in a Demons of Doom campaign. For a full
register of all the Gods, plus a list of all Priestly
Powers, consult the indices at the back of this book.
Each God is presented in alphabetical order in the
same format:
• The name of the God.
• The God’s title.
• The God’s unique Specific Power they can
bestow upon their Priests.
• The God’s three General Powers. For more
details of the General Powers granted to
Priests, see the previous chapter.
• A paragraph(s) of lore about the God, including their affiliations, spheres of influence, appearance, followers, holy symbol, sacred colour, and holy days, if any.

Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
CHAPTER 4 - THE CALENDAR OF TITAN

In this chapter, drawing from the comprehensive
lorebook that is An Astronomer's Almagest, we
consider the calendar of Titan and its various holy
days and celebrations of the Gods. However, one
must realise that calendars measure time, and the
months, weeks and days, that form the ever spinning
cycle of the time God Chronada.
We will look especially closely at the major holy days,
festivals and celebrations that shape the unfolding of
time, so that one may know what particular event is
happening when, where and for  what purpose. But
first, that eye, the sky!
THE SKIES OF TITAN
The skies of Titan are an immense canvas on which
are painted a myriad miscellany of celestial objects
and entities. In order of importance these number the
sun, the moon, the other five planets, the stars in their
constellations, and sundry random phenomena, such
as comets, crashed meteors, and shooting stars. The
regularity of movement many of these celestial
bodies exhibit helps measure time and create
consistent calendars for Titan.
As such, they generally change li0le from a Hero's
perspective, other than the usual seasonal variations,
but signs and portents require spectacular celestial
events. Roll on the following tables to determine
what and how something might happen, followed by
individual sections with more details on the
particulars of these events.
Roll
Daily Frequency
1-3
Low: Roll 16, 17, or 18 on 3d6 for an event
4-5
Average: Roll 11 or 12 on 2d6 for an event
High: Roll 6 on 1d6 for an event
If a celestial event has been generated by a daily
frequency roll or a random event (for example, see
the Adventure Creation System, p275), roll on the
below table to determine what type of event has
happened.
Roll

Sun
Moon

Roll again twice, ignoring 6
Consult the relevant section below for specific details
of what type of celestial event has affected the entity
in question. If multiple celestial bodies are involved
(ignoring duplicate rolls and further rolls of 6), the
event is caused by the interaction of the two (or
more), such as a comet appearing within a certain
constellation of stars, a sudden shooting star near a
planetary conjunction, and so on.
Due to visibility and conditions, events involving the
sun generally happen during the day, while all other
events usually occur at night. Celestial phenomena
involving two or more bodies could happen at any
time.
The Sun
Without a doubt the most important celestial body in
the sky, the Sun is the giver of light, warmth and thus
life, helping crops and plants to grow across Titan.
Associated with the sun Goddess Glantanka, the sun
is almost universally considered female, though
dissenting voices do exist. For example, in Far
Analand and the Lendleland Steppes, or the interior
of Khul, where Glantanka is known as Hazdur, a
male form is proscribed.
The orbit of the sun around Titan, or Titan around the
sun, if you believe that sort of thing, is generally
stable. There are two solstices, the winter solstice,
which is the shortest day of the year, and the summer
solstice, which is the longest. Equally, there are two
equinoxes, the spring equinox and the autumn
equinox, both of which being where the day is the
same length as the night.
Despite this generally apparent global regularity, the
strong magical field of Titan, among other things, is
known to cause some strange local solar effects. If
needed, these can be determined by rolling on the
table below.

Solar Eclipse
Solar Wind

Solar Eclipse
A Solar Eclipse occurs when the moon moves
between the sun and Titan, blocking the light of
Glantanka from reaching the world. Roll on the
following table to determine the totality of the
eclipse. Solar Eclipses can happen anywhere, and
typically last for 1-6 minutes.
Roll
Eclipse Totality
1-3
Partial Eclipse: +1 STAMINA to all Undead
and Demons. Creatures blinded by sunlight,
such as Dark Goblins, have no problem.
4-6
Total Eclipse: +1 SKILL and +2 STAMINA to
all Undead and Demons. Creatures blinded
by any kind of light have no problem.
THE SUN RUNES
The Sun Runes are universal across all Titan cultures
and take two major forms. The first, more recent
form, is that of a dot surrounded by a circle. An older
form is the same as this, except for eight arrows
radiating out from the central dot, as stylised rays or
beams of golden sunlight.
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
THE GAME OF ECLIPSE
This two-player boardgame is particularly popular in
the taverns and inns of the Old World. It is a
gambling game requiring a stake of 5-10gp to play,
which is matched by the opponent. Eclipse is played
on a circular wooden board, with 20 counters placed
on a ring divided into 20 sections. Fifteen of the
counters depict suns and five feature a moon design.
The players begin on opposite sides of the board, as
marked. They ignore the counter they start on, then
take turns to roll the die, moving their token around
in an anti-clockwise direction. A counter a player
lands on they keep. If a player lands on a space
occupied by their opponent, then the opponent must
give them a sun counter, if they possess any. Empty
spaces do not impart any counters.
Once all the counters have been removed from the
board, the scores are totalled. Sun counters count
towards the total, whereas moon counters eclipse the
sun and are subtracted from the total. For example, if
you had won 8 sun counters but had also picked up 3
moon counters, then your total score would be 5.
Whoever has the higher total of suns at the end of the
game wins back their own stake money plus that of
the other player. In the event of a draw, your stake is
returned then one may play again or opt out.
Solar Wind
The Solar Wind is the sign of a massive sunspot
eruption on the surface of the sun. Visible only to
those with a telescope, the Solar Wind is a blast of
pure
energy,
thrashing
against
the
physical
boundaries of Titan like the tide upon the shore. For
the duration of the Solar Wind (typically 2-12 hours),
the powerful energies of the sun ensure all
spellcasters have bonuses determined by rolling on
the table below. Such is the bounty of the sun!
Roll
Solar Wind Cause and Effect
1-3
Minor Sunspots: +1 to any spellcasting roll
4-5
Major Sunspots: +2 to any spellcasting roll
Solar Flare: +3 to any spellcasting roll
Sun Dogs
The best time to see Sun Dogs is when the sun is low
in the sky, at the start or end of the day, in the colder
weather, but really they can be seen anywhere at any
time, when various Elemental Planes impinge upon
the Earthly one. Sun Dogs are a pair of smaller “false
suns” present alongside the real sun on either side,
but with some distance between them, like two
hounds following their master.
For the duration of the Sun Dogs appearance (usually
5-30 minutes), all sun or fire based magic has its
effects increased by half of the current total rounded
up. So, if a Firebolt spell normally does 1d6
STAMINA damage, it would now do 1d6 plus half
the roll in STAMINA damage. If you rolled a 3, that
would be 3 plus half rounded up (2), to give 5
STAMINA points damage if the spell is successful.
Eternal Sun
In some parts of the world, where the Elemental
Planes encroach too greatly upon the Earthly Plane,
eddies of great magical power swirl across the face of
the land, and all the Laws of Nature are suspended.
In the Baklands, the wilderlands at the centre of
Chaos-tainted Kakhabad, it is said that day and night
never follow each other at equal intervals.
At times there, especially in spring when magical
energy is at its peak, the sun appears never to set in
the western sky for weeks on end.
The Eternal Sun usually lasts for 1-3 days elsewhere,
but for 1-6 weeks in the Baklands. During this time
rest is difficult because of the absence of night, and
thus sleep restores only half the usual STAMINA
points. In addition, any creature normally harmed by
sunlight cannot leave its lair, while Undead and
Demons that can manifest during the day must
reduce their SKILL by 1 and their STAMINA by 2,
due the constant sunshine from the Eternal Sun.
Black Sun
In an instant the world goes black, as if the sun had
been snuffed out like a candle. This is known as the
Black Sun in Kakhabad, where it regularly affects the
Baklands, and is blamed on the appearance of the
magical Moon Serpent among other things (see
Beyond the Pit, p120).
Elsewhere it is called the Invisible or Dark Sun, and
in particular permanently afflicts some areas of the
great Wastes of Chaos. Here it is said the sun never
shows itself, hidden by clouds of swirling grey dust
that prevent Nature from ever reestablishing a
foothold in the region. The Black Sun lasts for 1-3
days and during this time all Chaos creatures,
Demons and Undead can add +2 SKILL and +4
STAMINA to their scores.
Twin Suns
The extremely rare magical phenomenon of the Twin
Suns has been known to happen elsewhere, but is
primarily recorded from the eponymous Twin Sun
Desert in central Khul. Essentially, there are two suns
in the sky! They are indistinguishably identical in
appearance, being mirror images of each other, and
simply known as “The Twins” or if further context is
required, “The Left” and “The Right”.
The blazing heat generated by having the Twin Suns
overhead is revitalising for certain types of monster.
Creatures or entities associated with the sun (e.g. the
Sun Serpent), or fire and heat (e.g. a Fire Elemental),
may add +2 to their SKILL and +4 to their STAMINA
scores, while those magical creatures that are water
based must reduce their SKILL by 1 and their
STAMINA score by 2. In addition, the heat is such
that even material such as leather is now flammable
and ignitable. The duration of the Twin Sun effect is
typically 1-3 days, except in the Twin Sun Desert,
where it is permanent. Here, nomads and dervishes
of the desert ta0oo themselves with the holy Mark of
the Twin Sun.
MARK OF THE TWIN SUN
The pull of the Twin Suns over the desert of the same
name exerts a savage toll upon its populace, the
relentless heat and light beating down with only the
temporary hours of night to look forward to, before
the Twin Suns rise again at dawn. Nomads and
dervishes of the region acknowledge the influence of
the Twin Suns upon their lives by ta0ooing the mark
of the dual solar bodies – two interlinked sun runes –
somewhere prominent upon their skin.
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
The Moon
Sibling to the sun, the moon is the second most
important celestial body in the skies of Titan, and one
whose depiction as a Deity famously differs a
considerable amount. Known variously as the
Goddess Lunara, the God Lord Moon, Tiriel the
Silent Guardian, Kuran, or Phlanx, the moon God can
be male or female and Good or Evil.
This diversity of forms is perhaps due to the moon’s
own changing state, the phases shifting and altering
depending on both the movement of the sun and
Titan itself. The eight – not four! – phases of the moon
have a distinct terminology, and each phase typically
lasts three to four days before moving on to the next
one. They are listed below:
Moon Symbol
Lunar Phase
New Moon
Waxing Crescent
First Quarter
Waxing Gibbous
Full Moon
Waning Gibbous
Last Quarter
Waning Crescent
The main effects of the different lunar phases
generally relate to visibility at night; most stages
would count as darkness, except the full moon, which
would be limited visibility. Equally, Were-creatures
may choose on any given night to a0ain their bestial
form, but if it is a full moon, then they transform
automatically as soon as the moon appears in the sky,
generally around dusk. All of these phases are
represented by their symbols showing when they
occur on the Titan calendar beginning on p121.
Like the sun, the moon is also affected by the various
weird magical fields emanating from Titan, and all
kinds of interesting phenomena have been reported.
In the event of a lunar phenomenon occurring, roll on
the table below to determine what it is.

THE MOON RUNE
The crescent of the moon rune may face in either
direction, and is a common symbol, particularly
among ancient civilisations. The rise of cults to moon
avatars or Gods such as Phlanx or Shekka, as well as
the moon’s association with Were-creatures, means
that care must be taken in deploying or depicting the
moon rune in public however, lest one offend a
dangerous puritan, such as a Witch Hunter or Anti-
Sorcerer who deems it a truly irredeemable symbol of
Evil.
Lunar Eclipse
Unlike a Solar Eclipse, a Lunar Eclipse occurs when
the sun causes the shadow of Titan to fall across the
moon, cloaking it in darkness. Legend holds the
Shadow King can be summoned at this time. Roll on
the following table to determine the totality of the
eclipse. Lunar Eclipses can happen anywhere, and
typically last for 20-120 minutes.
Roll
Eclipse Totality
1-3
Partial Eclipse: +1 STAMINA to all Undead
and Demons
4-6
Total Eclipse: +1 SKILL and +2 STAMINA to
all Undead and Demons
Moon Dogs
Moon Dogs can be seen anywhere at any time and are
a pair of smaller “false moons” present alongside the
real moon on either side, but with some distance
between them, like two hounds following their
master. They are thought to represent the Ethereal
Plane influencing the Earthly Plane during the
nocturnal hours, and some say this is the origin of the
monstrous Moon Dog hounds of the same name.
For the duration of the Moon Dogs appearance
(usually 5-30 minutes), all moon, shadow or night
based magic, including Necromancy, has its effects
increased by half of the current total rounded up. So,
if a Spectral Dart spell normally does 1d3 STAMINA
damage, it would now do 1d3 plus half the roll in
STAMINA damage. If you rolled a 4 that would be 2,
plus half of 2 which is 1, to give 3 STAMINA points
damage if the spell is successful.
Black Moon
A Black Moon is when the moon is so tangled within
the Shadow Plane it cannot rise into the sky. It can
happen at any time, but usually occurs as the second
new moon in a calendar month.
In the current calendar year, a Black Moon is
scheduled to begin on the 29th day of the month of
Warming (see p126).
The Black Moon last for 1-3 nights, as the Earthly
Plane is blasted with forces of entropy from the Plane
of Shadows. During this time, all Demons and
Undead can add +1 SKILL and +2 STAMINA to their
scores.
Traditionally, the Night of the Black Moon is the time
when the forces of Chaos and Evil work their greatest
mischief. Just recently, the Archmage of Mampang
sent the Bird Men of High Xamen to steal the Crown
of Kings from the kingdom of Analand on such a
night. Equally, merchants like Arnor of Firetop
Mountain are quick to claim a recent occurrence of
the Long Dark Night as a valid reason for the
inflation regarding Blue Candle prices.
The greatest such Night of the Black Moon however,
happened millennia ago back during the Godtime,
when the Dark Lords of Evil and Chaos restrained
Lunara and created Eternal Night over Titan, at least
for a while. They unleashed monsters and beasts
upon the land, the Manticores, Basilisks, Gargoyles
and worse, and infected the Children of Hashak, the
Orcs, Goblins, Trolls and Ogres, with the taint of
Chaos and Evil as well.
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
Blood Moon
Some say the cause of this blood red moon is an
impending natural disaster, some say it heralds a full
lunar eclipse, and some say the Red Moon merely
reflects those torrid times when the Planes of Chaos
encroach a li0le closer than is absolutely necessary
onto the domain of the Earthly Plane. The Blood
Moon lasts for 1-3 nights regardless of lunar phase
(excepting new moons of course), and during this
time all Demons, Undead and Chaos creatures may
add +1 SKILL and +2 STAMINA to their scores.
Once every 37 years, a Blood Moon occurs with such
ferocity it is known as Shekka’s Moon, after the
nefarious Goddess of witchcraft. Shekka’s Moon is
always a crescent moon and has the same Powers as
the Blood Moon above, except that it lasts for just one
night. In addition, all Evil spellcasters will have +1 to
any spellcasting rolls they make for the duration of
Shekka’s Moon.
Shekka’s Moon is also known as the Witches’ Moon,
and all Hags, Sirens, Cursewitches, Crones and
Witches gain a +2 bonus to any spellcasting rolls or
Devotion scores used in the service of Shekka. This
reflects her greatest darkest power upon the world of
Titan at this time.
During a recent occurrence of Shekka’s Moon in the
Old World kingdom of Ruddlestone, a coven of the
Evil sect known as the Cauldron of Midnight was
convened by Nazek the Warlock. His aim, blessed by
the Powers of the red crescent moon above, was to
conduct a Ritual of Unlocking to open the Casket of
Shadows – the Demafrauge! – and access a portal to
the Pit to allow the Demon Prince known as the
Kurakil to enter the world of Titan! Fortunately a
nameless adventurer now known forever more as the
Spellbreaker destroyed these hideous plans, aided by
Karad the Witch Hunter and the Resistance.
Twin Moons
The extremely rare magical phenomenon of the Twin
Moons has been known to happen elsewhere, but is
primarily recorded from the lands of the Inland Sea
in southern Khul. Essentially, there are two moons in
the sky at night time! The smaller, green “minor
moon” is known as Peon, and the larger blue “major
moon” is known as Fey.
The rise of green Peon impacts all children of Hashak
– the Goblins, Orcs and Trolls. All of these creatures
may add +1 to their A0ack Rolls while Peon remains
in the sky.  By contrast, blue Fey is the favoured moon
of the Fey folk, the Elves, Fairies, Pixies, Sprites,
Spriggans, Elvins, Leprechauns and other such
people. All of them may also add +1 to their A0ack
Rolls while Fey is high in the sky.
The duration of the Twin Moon effect is typically 1-3
days, except around the lands of the Inland Sea,
where it is permanent. Here, Desert Goblins bathe in
the green light of the moon Peon before a raid, and
Nereids play in the night waters of the River Parine,
lit by the blue glow of Fey.
Blue Moon
A Blue Moon is the occurrence of a second full moon
in a calendar month, when the lunar surface is
coloured a pale blue by powerful forces of magic and
enchantment.  In the current calendar year, a Blue
Moon is scheduled to begin on the 30th day of the
month of Close (see p131). Blue Moons last for 1-3
nights, as the magical winds of fortune and fate wash
over the Earthly Plane. During this time, all Tests for
Luck have a +1 bonus to one’s LUCK score.
The Blue Moon is also the name of a boat captained
by Samuel Crow, that sails out of Port Blacksand to
the dock of Skaar, and also stopping at the infamous
trio of Snake, Ghost and Dogfish Islands.
The Planets
Certain
astronomers,
including
such
diverse
practitioners as learned Gallantarian sages and
Caarth Sorcerer-Priests have used telescopes to prove
the existence of other planets close to Titan.
Based on their appearance through the telescopes of
stargazers, the planets have been assigned to certain
Gods, in much the same way the sun is identified as
Glantanka and the moon as Lunara. Thus, Atlan,
messenger to the Gods, has his name given to a small,
fast-orbiting white planet, while two larger planets,
one a beguiling green, the other a bright red, are
named after Galana and Filash. The final two are very
large planets, one grey and one blue, titled after Sukh
and Hydana.
From an alchemical perspective, there are seven
planets visible in the skies, two of which we have
already encountered, as the sun and the moon. The
remaining five planets that wander the night skies of
Titan are and can be rolled for an event, as follows.

Planetary Conjunction
An individual planet that has been rolled for an event
will be noticeable for its orbital aspect, whose effect
for each planet is determined by rolling on the next
table:
Planetary Conjunction
This celestial event occurs when the orbits of two or
more planets in the sky align in a configuration of
mystical significance.
Roll on the table below to determine the nature of the
planetary conjunction, namely the number of planets
involved.
Roll
Planet Number
4-6
Next roll on the planet table above to determine
which planets are involved, ignoring further rolls of
six or duplicate rolls of involved planets. Then roll on
the orbit table above for each planet to determine
their placement in the conjunction.
The effects of this table are cumulative; so that a
planetary conjunction of three ascendant planets
would have a +3 bonus to their A0ack Roll for
creatures of each planet. The effects of the planetary
conjunction last for as long as the conjunction itself,
which is typically around 10-60 minutes.
Some of the runes and symbols assigned to the
planets have come to represent other concepts in
addition to their alchemical use. For example the
symbol of Atlan has been used by the obscure lore
gathering race known as the Ranganathans, while
symbols of Galana and Filash have also become signs
for the female and male genders respectively.

PLANETARY RUNES
Like the sun and the moon, each planet has been
assigned its own rune or alchemical symbol, which
are different from each planet God’s holy symbol.
Below are the runes for each planet, named after its
associated Deity, along with a brief description of the
planet as seen through a telescope and what sphere of
effect it is believed to encompass.
For example, the planet Galana is thought to be
fortuitous for vegetation if ascendant in the night sky
during planting or harvesting seasons, while a
descending planet Sukh during storm season may
indicate balmier weather ahead.

In particular, the symbol of Galana features in

Amazons, shield-maidens and warrior-women, and
is often painted or engraved on their banners, shields
and armour. It was also used by the scholar Demetra
Ven, whose writings on women being created by
Logaan before men subsequently inspired an
uprising in Ruddlestone by the heretic Zillah of
Shekin.
“Steer a ship out of Pollua in Lendleland, and
head south-west by the light of the Dragon Star.
Keep on until it vanishes below the horizon, at
about the same time as the land behind you
disappears, and you will find yourself sailing in
unfamiliar seas under foreign stars.”
Life on Titan (p22)
Ernst Kandermann

The Stars
Like pearls sca0ered across a black velvet drape, the
stars are strewn through the night skies, their
constellations forming the many signs of the
complicated astrological zodiac systems of Titan. By
watching the stars with telescopes in observatories,
several groups of people have gleaned much
knowledge about the heavens above them.
These include the ancient Stargazer civilisation of
what is now north-eastern Khul (and whose
knowledge was then distributed throughout the
since-fallen Kabeshian Empire), the Caarth snake
people of the Desert of Skulls, and the astronomer
Priests of Silur Cha, the two-headed Liash Cha Lizard
Men in bright scarlet robes, peering at the night skies
from their enormous Temple complex in the depths
of the southern swamplands.
Wise in the way of the stars, such astronomers are
learning the secrets of the universe in their
observations. These stellar watchers know that the
stars above, those glimmering candles in the heavens,
those pinpoints of light, are nothing less than other
suns, possibly even circled by planets much like Titan
itself!
However that may be, the skies overhead are packed
with countless stars and other celestial phenomena.
In different lands, different names have been given
and constellations picked out, but in most lands the
people firmly believe that the stars represent the
forms, deeds or domains of their Patron deities. See
the two sky-charts here for examples of the forms the
stars are said to take, followed by a table
documenting their theological connections.

Among all the stars of the heavens, the most
prominent is the Dragon Star, the brightest central
celestial body of the northern hemisphere. It is used
extensively as a reference point in navigation,
especially at sea, and is the final star in the tail of the
Kilanirax or Dragon King constellation.
These star charts can be used to determine the basics
of a zodiacal system but such details are beyond us
here. Instead, if you wish to determine a birth sign for
a Hero or other personality to add some colour or
explain strange personality traits, roll on the
constellation chart above to find a birth sign.
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
If a celestial event involving the stars is encountered,
it will typically be the prominence or fading of a
particular constellation. What causes this changing of
brightness for a constellation is unknown, but some
astronomers theorise it is related to the presence of
great interstellar dust clouds or debris, or the
fluctuating magical fields present around the planet
of Titan. The zodiac effect is applied to all
worshippers and followers of the God associated
with the relevant constellation, and lasts for the
duration of 1-6 nights.

Alternative names for all the stars and constellations
may be known in other lands. Certainly, the Caarth
and Lizard Men are thought to have their own names
in their own languages for these celestial bodies, as
do foreign places as well. Around the shores of the
Inland Sea, for example, one speaks of the Serpent’s
Tail, the Gorgon, the Nine Heroes, Varg the Horror,
Banopus the Eye of the Hag, and various other
terminologies for the zodiac constellations known
more commonly by the other names as given on the
table above.
Other Celestial Phenomena
In addition to the sun, the moon, the planets, and the
stars, mention must be made of several other types of
celestial phenomena visible in the skies of Titan,
namely comets, meteors and shooting stars. If

Traditionally they are seen as harbingers of freak
circumstance, whether fortuitous or not, as warnings
sent by the Gods that things may soon change if the
proper acts of piety are not undertaken to appease
various deities immediately. Roll to determine the
type of comet that has been spo0ed.

The effect of the comet’s magic will happen once a
day, for the 1-3 days the comet remains visible in the
sky.
Meteor
Meteors are heavenly bodies flaming across the skies
of Titan in short, fast celestial pathways that typically
end with an explosive impact upon the surface of the
world. Given this, they are often considered extreme
examples of divine punishment, as the Gods inflict
near-instant destruction from the skies against Titan
for transgressions both real and imaginary.
However, meteors may also carry valuable payloads,
and where possible, the trajectories of such crashes
are plo0ed by astronomers and sold to interested
parties. Any prospector deserving of the name knows
a meteor full of Star Metal (see Encyclopedia Arcana:
Volume 1, p83) could literally be worth its weight in
gold many times over to the right buyer!  To
determine the details of randomly encountered
meteor crashes, roll on the tables below.  First, roll for
the number of meteors that have impacted upon the
surface of Titan.
Roll

These rolls are cumulative, so an average-sized (+0)
meteor of average density (+1) would have 1 unit of
Star Metal present, whereas a huge meteor (+2) of
super light density (-2) would have zero units of Star
Metal present.
Adding the unit numbers together will give you the
amount of Star Metal units present within each
meteor (results of zero and below obviously indicate
the complete absence of Star Metal). They could of
course carry other payloads, such as parasitic space
demons,  amorphous blob-monsters, or a deposit of
valuable star crystals.
Shooting Star
Shooting stars are essentially the same as meteors,
except they flame and burn out far up in the sky
rather than crash to earth. Roll on the tables below for

Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
A YEAR ON TITAN
A year on Titan, as measured by the best astronomers
in the land, lasts three hundred and sixty-five days, as
the planet orbits the sun Glantanka, give or take a few
days for random magical forces. Or at least so say the
members of the Guild of Timekeepers, but by reading
the following you will never have to pay them a
fistful of gold pieces again to know what the date is!
The following section will break down the annual
calendar, based on the movements of celestial bodies
across the sky, into discrete units, such as yearly
sequences, months, seasons, weeks, days and hours.
WHAT YEAR IS IT?
What exact year is it on the world of Titan? What is
the correct calendar date to start with? Particularly
since there is a calendar present in this very book –
what year is this calendar set at? These are excellent
questions, and ones that will be answered with
several solutions.
Both the AFF rulebook (p101) and Titan (p42, p114)
state the current year is 284 AC, the Year of the Fox.
Blacksand’s most recent date given is 279 AC (p34),
while the Adventure Creation System begins its year
count at 248 AC (p263). The calendar in this book has
been based on that from The Fighting Fantasy 10th
Anniversary Yearbook, by Marc Gascoigne and
published in 1992 by Puffin Books. Here the date was
given as 285 AC (p12), the Year of the Crocodile, and
that is the date that is used in this book.
Note: Dates on Titan are split between two systems. The
original dating system was Old Time or OT, which ran
from 0 OT when the world of Titan was created, to 1998
OT, when the apocalyptic events of the War of the Wizards
and the Great War against Evil happened. What was
supposed to be 1999 OT, instead became the first year of the
new age, 1 AC, where AC stands for After Chaos, of which
we are now in our third century of existence.
Reckoning the Years of the Turn During the Time of
Naming, when everything was given the title it
would carry until the end of time, the years were
allo0ed names in honour of the greatest of the beasts
that walked, swam or flew across the surface of Titan.
The years still pass in twenty-year cycles in honour of
the creatures whose names they bear. The cycle, and
the God associated with each creature, is as follows
(and can be rolled randomly if needed).

Some astrologers in Allansia and elsewhere believe
that people born in a particular animal’s year take on
the characteristics of that animal. People born under
the sign of the Owl, for example, are said to be wise
and noble, but with a hidden savagery; those born in
the Year of the Deer are said to grow up shy and
nervous, always fleeing from the least danger.
Whether or not it is true, many people give great
honour to the animal of their birth year on their
twentieth birthdays, when they come of age and
become recognised adults.
Heroes may find they have a special innate
connection with the creature of their birth year. They
gain a +2 bonus to Animal Lore and Animal Handling
tests relating to the animal of their birth year. So,
someone born in the Year of the Mouse has an affinity
with mice and other small rodents and gains a bonus
to their skill tests when interacting with them.
The extent to which this bonus applies is up to the
Director. They might decide that someone born in the
Year of the Bat has a natural affinity with bats, so they
ignore that Hero in combat or may a0empt to
communicate with them in a limited fashion. The
exception to this would be the Year of the Dragon – as
hungry intelligent creatures they have li0le interest in
the birthday of their food!
Each passing of the twenty-year cycle is called a
“Turn”, so an old man may talk of being born in the
Year of the Spider, three Turns ago. Of course, as you
already know, the more civilised cultures also talk in
terms of real dates, according to the system
standardised by scholars of the various seats of
learning of the known world after the War of the
Wizards. They instituted the After Chaos reckoning,
of which we are now in the 285th year, the Year of the
Crocodile.
Thus, if he were a li0le more educated, and were
proficient enough at the generally unknown
discipline of mathematics, our elderly gentleman
may tell us that he was born in 222 AC, and that he is
a venerable sixty-three years old.
The Years in Other Lands
In other lands they use very different systems for
reckoning the years (though in some lands, such as
Frostholm in the frozen north-east of Allansia, the
people have no calendar at all, for they neither know
nor care about their birth-dates or the time of the
year!).
Many people simply date their lives after noteworthy
events, such as “four years after the Ba0le for
Vymorna Pass” or “seventeen years after Hurlinn
beheaded King Shakash of Kaynlesh-Ma”. The
calendar of the semi-human nomads of the Baddu-
Bak Plains in Kakhabad is based on years being a
certain number “Away” from the present; in other
words, last year is One Away, and our old man was
born in Sixty-three Away.
The people of Hachiman in remote Khul reckon years
by a cycle of eight named years, and also by the year
of the reign of their ruler. Thus our old man might tell
us that he was born in the Year of the Fish in the
fourth year of Shogun Aykira (the grandfather,
incidentally, of the current Shogun, Kihei Hasekawa).
The Hachimanese cycle, and the God associated with
each year, is as follows (and can be rolled randomly if
needed).

HOW OLD IS MY HERO?
Heroes on Titan have three differing starting ages
depending on whether they are human, Dwarf or Elf.
The table below shows the full lifespan of each type
of Hero as well as a suggested starting age that can be
randomly determined.

Elf

These starting ages are consistent with what has
already come before in the Advanced Fighting
Fantasy rulebook, Titan, Heroes of Titan, and the
Adventure Creation System. The ages of other
humanoid creatures can be based on these three
bands. For example, Man-Orcs and Halflings likely
have the same age range as humans, whilst Half-
Elves, being midway between human and Elf,
probably have an age range identical to that of
Dwarfs.
Both the Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebook and
the Adventure Creation System state that age does
not affect a Hero’s scores or abilities, but that is likely
only true for adults, who are most Heroes. Below are
presented six different age stages: Child, Adolescent,
Adult, Old, Elder and Geriatric, the age ranges they
correspond to for humans, Dwarfs and Elves, and the
likely effects of such stages on a Hero or NPC’s SKILL
and STAMINA scores, and their Damage Roll.
Ageing and its detrimental effects as one gets older
can be prevented or reversed by magical means, such
as a Potion of Longevity. However, dying of natural
causes becomes a real thing, starting with humans at
70 years old, or 130 for Dwarfs or 230 for Elves. When
a Hero gets to this age, roll two dice, and add the
result to the age; this is the maximum age the Hero
will live to (if you roll a double six, add twelve and
roll again and add this; if this second roll is also
twelve, then add and roll again, and so on).
Alternatively, starting at 70, roll a die at the start of
every year; unless a six is rolled, the Hero dies that
year of natural causes. If they roll a six, they live
another year, and get to roll again at the start of the
next year to see if they live one more year, and so on.
Note: Ageing in Heroes or others has never been dealt with
definitively in either edition of Advanced Fighting
Fantasy so far, so the above is both a summary of what we
already know and what ideas we can use going forward.
Consistent age ranges for non-humans especially, across
Fighting Fantasy canon, have always been somewhat
undefined. For example, in Dungeoneer and other sources,
Dwarfs and Elves have the same starting ages as human
Heroes. If you prefer this approach, then rule that Dwarfs
and Elves have the same Child and Adolescent stages as
humans. However, while the Adult age range for humans
is from twenty to fifty years, for Dwarfs it will be twenty to
one hundred years, and Elves it will be twenty to two
hundred years – almost two full centuries of adulthood!

Measuring the Months of Titan
Like with the years, in different parts of Titan, there
are differing names and reckonings for the months of
any given year, but in most civilised regions each
year is divided into twelve months. Within each
month, the days are counted out, so that in Allansia,
for example, a day might be Seaday, 6th day of Dark.
However, there are two separate reckonings for the
days within such months.
The Allansian Reckoning
This system, which is also used across the Old World,
makes the months all different lengths, called by the
following names on the table below.
Each month has an associated Deity, and any Hero
born during that month can claim the special birth
month effect due to this, as per the Adventure
Creation System (p261-262). In gameplay, months
are used primarily when working out the income and
expenses of any Holdings and Dominions that a Hero
may possess (see Heroes Companion, p33-43).
The days are grouped into weeks, each consisting of
seven days. Careful study, however, will show that
this adds up to three days less than a normal 365-day
year. After the month of Locking, the Allansian
calendar adds three uncounted days for the
celebration of New Year.
Children born during this  celebration time are
considered very well blessed, and great things are
expected of them. During this time, the cold stillness
of the winter is broken by 72 hours of riotous
celebration.
The Khulian Reckoning
For as long as people have reckoned days and
months, the countries of the mysterious continent of
Khul have had twelve months, each exactly 30 days in
length, and each made up of five weeks of six days
apiece. The months are named on the table below. As
with the Allansian reckoning, each month has an
associated Deity, and any Hero born during that
month can claim the special birth month effect due to
this, as per the Adventure Creation System (p262) –
from which this table originally comes.
Interestingly, and perhaps reflecting the dourer
nature of those inhabiting the continent of Khul,
several Dark Lords are included as monthly Gods,
including Death, Disease and Arhallogen, whereas
those beings are absent from the monthly calendars
of Allansia and the Old World.
At the end of the year, after the month of Land’s
Sleeping, the people of all the countries of civilised
Khul mark New Year with not three but five days of
merry-making, though it must be said that in many
parts of the continent the celebrations are more
sombre, as the people give thanks to their various
Gods and pray for a prosperous year to come.

Four Seasons and the Weather
The four seasons of the year are, of course, spring,
summer, autumn and winter, and are comprised of
different
months
depending
on
whether
the
Allansian yearly reckoning (for Allansia and the Old
World) or the Khulian reckoning is being used. They
are as follows.

In game terms, the main
effects of the seasons will
be on the weather, and
how it affects Heroes,
especially
if
they
are
outside
(see
the
accompanying
weather
rules below).
Different
seasons
also
impact on the availability
of finding various herbs
and fungi using the Herb
Lore Special Skill (see The
Titan Herbal, p5-6).
Farmers and peasants across Titan typically ascribe
Deity-like titles to the seasons. Thus, spring is
governed by Mistress Springtime, summer by the
Summer Lord, autumn by Madame Autumn, and
winter by Grandfather Winter (also known as Old
Man Winter).
The Gods associated with these titles are given on the
seasons table above, though some cultures have
different seasonal Gods, such as a male version of
Glantanka for the Summer Lord, or Cholumbara for
Madame Spring. Avatars of these entities are also
known on Titan. For example, the Winter King is a
powerful undead warrior who dwells in the tower of
Frostfinger, in the middle of a frozen lake on one of
the northern Diamond Islands, where he holds court
over mouldering Ice Warriors and the like.
The Four Winds
Finally, each season is also associated with a divine
wind, a powerful tempest prevalent at that time of
year. These seasonal gales are all children of the God
Pangara, and some beings on Titan, such as the King
of the Four Winds on the isle of Trysta, or the Keeper
of the Four Winds from the Howling Plains, claim to
control these gusts and breezes, or at least
replicate their powers. The four major
winds of Titan are as follows.

THE WEATHER OF TITAN
There are several methods for generating weather
conditions in Advanced Fighting Fantasy, including
for specific locations such as Port Blacksand (see
Blacksand, p35), or Darkwood Forest (see The Forest
of Doom, p8-10), or more general areas of wilderness
(such as the Heroes Companion, p71-72, and Chapter
6 in the Adventure Creation System). Presented
below is a simplified system that compiles and
condenses all of the above into something that can be
used alongside the Calendar of Titan in this book,
and/or the Adventure Creation System for either
group or solo play.
Frequency
Every calendar day, roll for weather depending on
your desired frequency.
• Once a day
• Twice a day (day and night)
• Three times (morning, afternoon and night)
Roll 3d6 for each category on the table on the
following page (temperature, clouds, wind strength,
precipitation, and the chance of special weather
events), or roll once and use all the results on that
row. No ma0er the chosen frequency, special weather
is rolled once only for a 24-hour period.
Duration
Depending on the desired frequency, weather lasts
for the entire duration until another roll is required.
Modifiers
Apply the following modifiers to the roll for all
weather categories except special weather.
Season: Spring +1
Climate: Cold -2
Season: Summer +3
Terrain: Ice -4
Season: Autumn -1
Terrain: Mountain -2
Season: Winter -3
Terrain: Jungle +2
Climate: Hot  +2
Terrain: Desert +4
Notes:
• Temperature extremes of heat and cold cause
various issues (see Heroes Companion, p71-
72).
• The type of wind rolled is equivalent to the
Wind Strength table for sailing (see Blacksand,
p11).
• In deserts, a hurricane or gale is a sand or dust
storm, in ice or mountain terrain, during
winter, or in cold weather, it is a snowstorm.
• Precipitation is always rain, unless it is in ice
terrain, during winter, or in cold weather, in
which case it is snow. For mountainous
terrain, roll 1d6: 1-3 rain, 4-6 snow.
• Weather can affect the use of Special Skills and
combat through negative modifiers as follows:
Heavy or very heavy rain
-1
Fog/Mist (visibility)
-2
Mud or muck
-2
Medium Wind (missiles)
-2
Strong Wind (missiles)
-4
Gale/Hurricane/Storm (missiles)
-8
Special kinds of weather
For special weather events, roll 2d6 and consult the
appropriate column for the terrain type on the table
below.
These special weathers should be determined based
on the adventure. Special “rain” could cause
flooding, be a rain of fish or acid. A storm could mean
the risk of lightning strikes, a magical storm, a storm
creature etc.
Se0lements of any kind use the surrounding terrain
type (for conditions in dungeons, ruins or caves, see
the Adventure Creation System, p165).

Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
Pacing out the Days of the Week
In Allansia and the Old World each week has seven
days, but in Khul, each week has only six days, and
these are all shown in full on the tables below.
It can be important to keep track of which day of the
week it is during the course of an adventure, for such
is the power of the elements and magic on the world
of Titan that one will soon discover that different
types of magic work be0er on the days associated
with them than on the days linked to their opposing
elements.
Before starting an adventure, one needs to determine
which day of the week it is. Find, choose or roll one
die on the table below; the adventure will start on the
corresponding day as per the table (so if a 1 is rolled,
the adventure starts on Stormsday, and so on). As
soon as Highday has passed, simply move back to the
start of the week and Stormsday again.
THE SUN GOD’S QUEST
In some distant lands, primitive tribes still believe
that the world is flat, and that the sun (or in many
places, the sun Goddess) crosses the sky on a
gleaming chariot once a day. During the night she
fights her way through the underworld, facing
terrible dangers in her struggle to balance Good and
Evil and keep the world alive. She returns again at
dawn the next day, starting the whole cycle over
again. Of course, no civilised people would ever
believe in such things!
The Allansian Reckoning
The days of the week for Allansia and the Old World,
their associated Gods, and their effects, are as follows.
Day (God)
Effect
Stormsday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all
(Sukh)
storm-based creatures
Moonsday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all Undead
(Lunara)
Fireday

Earthday

(Pangara)
based creatures
Seaday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all
(Hydana)
water-based creatures
Highday
No effect!
(Titan)
The Khulian Reckoning
The days of the week for Khul, their associated
deities, and their effects, are as follows:
Day (God)
Effect
Rageday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all
(Titan)
fire-based creatures
Freezeday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all ice-
(Farigiss)
based creatures
Fearday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all Lesser
(Death)
Undead
Lifeday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all
(Throff)
earth-based creatures
Wildday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all
(Sukh)
storm-based creatures
Spiritday
+1 SKILL, +2 STAMINA to all Greater
(Lunara)
Undead
Note: These rules have been adapted from the Fighting
Fantasy gamebook Stormslayer by Jonathan Green, and
appeared previously in Return to the Pit (p10-11).
On Highday in many civilised parts of Allansia and
in some of the principalities in the western continent,
and on Spiritday in Khul, most work stops and those
of religious persuasion a0end the Temples and
Chapels to worship their various Gods for much of
the  day, spending the rest relaxing in comfort.
Seaday (and Wildday in Khul) is always market day,
even in the smaller villages and hamlets; larger towns
and cities usually have markets and bazaars open
almost every day.
As with various years and months, astrologers insist
the day of the week determines the character of a
child from its birth. A baby born on Earthday, they
say, will be good with their hands, and destined to be
a crafter or a farmer, but one born on Moonsday will
be a scholar or a Priest, and will follow the path of
learning and enlightenment (incidentally, it is also
believed that most twins are born on Moonsday, and
surprisingly this appears to be true, at least in
Allansia).
As we can see from the above tables for the days of
the week, it is definitely true that different types of
magic work be0er on the days associated with them
than on the days of their opposing elements, to such
an extent that some specialised Sorcerers dare not
leave their towers on certain days; such is the power
of the elements and magic on Titan!
In addition, days can be marked off on the a0ached
calendar to keep track of time whether for group
play, or solo play using the Adventure Creation
System. Also remember, the passing of one day
restores 8 STAMINA points to a Hero if they get a
good sleep and eat two meals. For more rules on the
passage of time and natural healing, see Advanced
Fighting Fantasy (p65). In addition, it restores a
wizard’s Magic Points to their total, and restores the
powers of a Priest, both assuming they get a good
night’s sleep. Hirelings’ wages are paid daily as well
(see Heroes Companion, p31).

These two diagrams depict the days of the week in

simple day counters when needed.

Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
Marking the Hours of the Day
A full rotational cycle upon Titan’s axis lasts twenty-
four hours on the surface of the planet, from the first
Hour of the Owl, to the twenty-fourth and last Hour
of the Moon, and then back to the start again. The
marking of time is the provenance of Temples,
Shrines, Monasteries and Abbeys, who typically
announce the beginning of a new hour with a number
of bangs on the gong, pealing of the bells, calling of
the faithful or sounding of the horn.
Also used to measure time on Titan are various
chronometers including sundials, hourglasses, and
simple mechanical clocks. Port Blacksand even has a
Clock Street, while many Old World cities such as
Kharé have large municipal clocks on display for
public consultation. Each hour consists of sixty
minutes, known as “dakkanat”, and each minute lasts
sixty seconds, known as “cabbanat”.
The latter, cabbanat, a0ained some prominence in the
legend of Chadda Darkmane, when he had just one
hundred cabbanat to successfully place and detonate
an explosive package of Firepowder (gifted to him by
Zagor the Warlock), aboard the flying ship known as
the Galleykeep, headquarters of the necromancer
Zharradan Marr.
To roll a random dakkanat (minute) or cabbanat
(second), simply roll one die for the first digit (6s
count as 0) and another die for the second digit. To
roll a random hour, roll one die twice on the
following table.

Some claim the hour of the God is lucky for followers
of that God, and if they need to Test their Luck during
such a time, these followers may add a +1 bonus to
their roll. From an Advanced Fighting Fantasy point
of view, these measurements of time are often used to
mark the duration of spell effects, and magical
powers, or the onset of poison or disease symptoms.
This time can be measured in-game (when marking
hours or working through the results of an A0ack
Round), or in real time, if dealing with seconds
(cabbanat) or minutes (dakkanat), as needed.
THE CALENDAR OF TITAN
In the next pages you will find a complete calendar of
Titan for 285 AC, the Year of the Crocodile, (which
originally appeared in The Fighting Fantasy 10th
Anniversary
Yearbook
by
Marc
Gascoigne,
published by Puffin Books in 1992). Each page
consists of a fully detailed month-specific almanac,
and a list of the major Rituals and celebrations to be
found across the world. We are sure you will
encounter more on your travels
however!
These festivals and celebrations are
not
just
included
in
here
as
examples of local colour. Hopefully
they should also provide Directors
and Heroes with many ideas for
adventures as well! Following this
twelve month calendar of months,
moon phases, holy days and other
celebrations, there are two random
generators.
The first table is for randomly
generating a holy day for any given
random God that otherwise lacks
one.
The
second
table
is
an
extension of that, for randomly
generating the birthdays of Heroes,
as well as other major personalities
whose date of birth may have major
ramifications, such as being a local
holiday, a religiously auspicious
occasion, or the charted chronology
for a prophecy or clairvoyant’s
vision.
If you get to the end of this calendar,
and need a new one for 286 AC, the
Year of the Owl, you have two
choices. You can either make your
own new calendar for the next year, using this one as
a template, but with the dates of the days all
advanced by one. Or, given that Allansia and the Old
World add three days to the end of the year, while
Khul adds five days; if you instead add six
unnumbered days of new year partying to the end of
this calendar, then you can simply reuse this calendar
again and again, without changing anything. Well,
except for the moon phases,  but you could just rule
they magically reset themselves as well…
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
NOTABLE DATES IN FREEZE
Freeze is the first month of the year, the second
month of winter, and as the coldest month of the year,
appropriately dedicated to the ice God Farigiss. It is
the time of year when farmers fix their hovels and
tools during the short days. At night, they huddle
around the hearth-fires, seeking shelter from the
freezing snow, chill winds, and packs of howling
wolves and other beasts that stalk the frozen
landscape in search of food.
Urguz (first day of Freeze, for two weeks): Urguz is
the greatest celebration in the Orcish calendar, a two
week festival of eating, drinking Orc Ale and
sleeping, that commemorates their Patron God
Hashak the Creator. Orc Priests and shamans use this
time to commune with Hashak through various
means
of
divination
including
Elfomancy,
culminating in Hashak’s holy day on the sixth day of
Freeze. Meanwhile, the average Orc watches the
finals of the annual inter-tribal games of “Orc Knees”
and “Pass the Slave”, with the champion-deciding
match occurring on the tenth day of Freeze. Orcish
funerals held during this time are considered
especially propitious, and strangers from other tribes
are often invited to take a bite or two of the deceased
for good luck. After Urguz the Orc tribes depart the
gathering-place for their home-lairs, and often
immediately begin warring with each other once
again!
Winter Ale Fair (8th of Freeze): Held at the Dwarf
town of Stonebridge, this is a week-long celebration
of beer and ale-tasting. Many kinds of Dwarf-brewed
and other special  beverages are presented, consumed
and judged; needless to say a Dwarfen brew usually
wins!
Fangthane Dwarfs invent gunpowder (19th Freeze,
1955 OT): On this day, over three centuries ago,
Dwarfs at the holy city of Fangthane discovered and
replicated the explosive properties of gunpowder.
For more information on the use of gunpowder and
gunpowder weapons, see Blacksand (p7-8).
NOTABLE DATES IN DARK
Dark is the second month of the year, the third and
final month of winter, and dedicated to the God
Sukh, whose black clouds cover the skies. This is the
toughest time of the year, with winter supplies
running low; hopefully the last harvest was a good
one! Slowly, so slowly, the world emerges from its
frozen prison.
As the month progresses, shoots begin to sprout, the
first creatures emerge from hibernation, and the
spring winds from the south begin to blow warmth
over the thawing land once more. Alas, in certain
parts of Titan, an ill wind blows in the aptly named
month of Dark.
Port Blacksand Thieves’ Guild Graduation begins
(19th of Dark): Perhaps appropriately for such a
sinister time of year, this day marks the start of the
graduation ceremonies for the apprentices of the Port
Blacksand Thieves’ Guild. For the next six weeks they
must pass a complicated series of tests to qualify as a
full thief, able to operate independently within the
city as they pay their regular membership dues.
These challenges conclude with the Night of Testing,
a daring heist designed to stretch the multifarious
talents of the trainee thief to the limit! They must
gather information, plan the heist, make good the
robbery and get clean away within a set time limit.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, less than one apprentice in
four passes these tests, with most of them failing in
the course of the final robbery. This ensures the Guild
is peopled only by fully qualified operatives, who are
skilled, capable, and perhaps lucky!
The Port Blacksand Guild of Assassins, known to its
members as the Brotherhood of the Knife, is said to
recruit most of its members from the Thieves Guild
also during this time, with the application of further
tests. Given the secretive nature of the Guild, further
details on the nature of these tests are unknown,
which is perhaps for the best, as everyone knows the
penalty for crossing the Guild of Assassins! For more
information on the Thieves’ Guild of Port Blacksand
(and the Assassins’ Guild!), see Blacksand (p44-45).
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
NOTABLE DATES IN UNLOCKING
Unlocking is the third month of the year and the first
month of spring, so it is perhaps not surprising to be
dedicated to Throff, Goddess of the life-giving earth.
Farmers bring out the ploughs and other tools to
break up the hard-packed soil. Spring is upon the
land and the deep winter chill can be forgo0en. By
half-way through Unlocking, blossoms have started
to appear on the trees and flowers are sprouting
everywhere. Most wonderfully, in the trees the birds
start scurrying hither and thither in search of material
with which to build their nests.
Hamelin Fair (1st of Unlocking): In north-western
Allansia, the town of Hamelin hosts a popular fair on
the first day of spring (and another one six months
later on the first day of autumn, in Reaping). The
Hamelin Fair is renowned for its entertainers,
sideshow games, food vendors and traders’ stalls.
Festival of the Waters (5th day of Unlocking in
Rimon and Halak, various days in other se0lements):
On this day, also known as the Feast of the Waters,
communities near large bodies of water upon Titan
celebrate the thaw of winter and the restoration of
water to the land. These festivities are held in a
number of fashions, depending on location.
For those river-dwellers living along the banks of the
Eltus in Arantis, or Tak or Parine in the lands of the
Inland Sea, it is a time to bring out carved boats and
symbolic wheat or rice stalks, offering prayers to
Aqualis for a heavy and fruitful flood to bring fertility
to their land.
In coastal ports such as Rimon and Halak, it is one of
the most important celebrations, denoting the time
that fishing boats can safely set sail once more.
Hydana, God the sea is petitioned for protection and
honoured by a festival occasion from dusk till dawn
that includes a parade of ships around the harbour,
boat-races, and fireworks. Huge rockets are fired to
mark the beginning and end of the celebration!
NOTABLE DATES IN SOWING
Sowing is the fourth month of the year and the
second month of spring. It is sacred to Hydana in his
aspect as the rain God. How aptly is this month
named, for it is now that the earth of the land is soft
and supple enough to be harrowed and sown with all
manner of crops that will grow slowly but surely,
throughout the summer months, until it is time for
them to be harvested in the autumn.
The Leaping Festival (first day of Sowing): This
bizarre celebration in the southern city of Shazâar, the
aptly named City of Madness, begins on this day. For
a whole week, no one dwelling with the city walls of
this strange place may set two feet upon the ground
one after the other but must jump or hop about in a
most peculiar fashion. The worship of the Trickster
God Logaan is very strong among the people of
Shazâar, and it is his bizarre Priests who have
ordained this festival in honour of their Deity. What
mysteries it hopes to reveal about the ways of Logaan
are not known at this time – perhaps they simply
suggested it because it is fun. It certainly is a
marvellous sport to see all the portly town councillors
having to jump everywhere, and the sight of them
being carried in their sedan chairs by two leaping
bearers has to be seen!
The Feast of Dumiol  (22nd of Sowing): In the cities
of Arantis, such as Kaynlesh-Ma, the Feast of Dumiol
is held on this day, and lasts for three days in total,
and similar festivals happen elsewhere in Shabak, the
city-states of the Glimmering Sea, and many places in
both Khul and the Old World. Dumiol is another
name for Vlada, God of trade and gambling, and this
three-day feast is a toast towards good profits and
lucky trading for the rest of the year. It is also a time
of much game-playing, including many that are
favourites in taverns across Titan, such as:
• Kharéan Roule0e
• Pinfinger
• Runestones
• Six Pick
• Snake Eyes
• Ten-Ten
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
NOTABLE DATES IN WINDS
This is the fifth month of the year and the last month
of spring. As one would expect, it is holy for Pangara,
God of the wind. For, in both Allansia and the Old
World, it is the time that the great plains and flatlands
of the continents will be swept by the Hagrel, the
southern gales, for many weeks to come. The nomad
tribes of the grasslands believe Hagrel to be a living
entity, and they keep their children inside their yurts,
for the Hagrel will steal a child left out alone, and
transport them many days’ ride away in an instant!
Whitewolf Fortnight (starts 7th of Winds): In Port
Blacksand, this day marks the supposed birthday of
the tyrant Lord Azzur. It is not known how old the
pirate lord is (though some reckon he was born in 223
AC), nor even if this is his actual birthday.
Nevertheless, all citizens of Port Blacksand must (by
law!) drink a toast to his lordship’s health and donate
a small present of money to his coffers. Always a
devious ruler, Lord Azzur also uses this date to begin
Whitewolf Fortnight, a two-week period celebrating
the founding of ancient Carsepolis by King Cares
Whitewolf. While many parties are held over the next
few days, there is a catch – no strangers are allowed
into the city while Whitewolf Fortnight is underway.
Festival of Eagles (27th of Winds): This celebration is
practised in northern se0lements across Allansia,
such as Zengis and Vynheim, as well as some parts of
the Old World and Khul. It honours the Hawklord,
God of birds, and involves a day of competition
between the best falconers in the region as their birds
race against each other to determine who is the fastest
and strongest. Competitors include falcons, hawks
and eagles, but other large raptors and their handlers
have been known to a0end. Devotees of the festival
have spread elsewhere, such as Fang, and even Port
Blacksand, where the Eagle Tower of Shareela has
birds of prey that have been rumoured to carry off
una0ended children!
NOTABLE DATES IN WARMING
Warming is the sixth month of the year, the first
month of summer, and dedicated to the sun Goddess
Glantanka. With the coming of summer, sheep are
shorn of their wool and manure spread on the fields.
It is a time of sunshine and happiness as well, a time
for games and tricks of all sorts – especially, as we
shall reveal, if you are lucky enough to be young and
to live in parts of the Old World.
Children’s Festival (first Highday of Warming): In
many
small
villages
across
Kakhabad
and
Ruddlestone, the citizens celebrate the joys of
childhood by allowing the children to exchange roles
with all the adults for a day and to have the freedom
of the village. Everyone over sixteen years of age
must serve the children all day, often pu0ing up with
beatings or thoroughly ludicrous requests according
to the whims of the impish children! The children do
exactly as they want for one day, secure in the
knowledge that the adults are not permi0ed to get
their own back the day after. It helps the adults see
what it is like to be a child for a day, and is, of course,
incredibly good fun for the younger participants!
Lucre Week (third week in Warming): The Logaan
worshippers of Shazâar use this week to give away all
their worldly wealth to show their devotion to the
Trickster God (and then spend the rest of the year
a0empting to recoup their losses).
Summer Solstice (22nd of Warming): The Summer
Solstice marks the longest day of the year. It is
considered a time of growth and of flourishing, with
Rituals and ceremonies held in stone circles by
Druids of the neutral Gods, such as Galana, Throff,
Glantanka, Lunara and Titan. The Challenge of the
Geomancers pertains to both the Solstice and the
Equinox:
“Equal length between, yet unequal in length,
What are we? The Equinox or the Solstice?”
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
NOTABLE DATES IN FIRE
Fire is the seventh month of the year, the second
month of summer, and as the ho0est time, sacred to
the fire God Filash. It is the very heart of summer,
especially in the southern parts of Allansia, that
swelter under the unblinking gaze of the sun. In the
lands surrounding the Desert of Skulls, the Caarth
snake people, encouraged by the warmth, raid the
unfortunate se0lements that border their realm for
captives and plunder.
Midsummer Fair (starts 15th of Fire): The ho0est
time of summer means the middle of summer, which
means the Midsummer Fair! This festival is typically
held over the course of a week in many lands, but
especially the nations of the Old World, Arion,
Ximoran, and north-western Allansia.
It is an event alive with the raucous shrieks and music
and laughter of the fairground, as merry-making
crowds wander through diverse entertainments,
from
troubadours,
fortune-tellers,
mummers,
storytellers, and menageries. There is much food to
be eaten, ale and cider to be quaffed, and tests of
strength, fitness and endurance, such as wrestling
wild bulls and horses, or ba0ling blindfolded with
staves. Gods such as Filash, Glantanka and Galana
are all honoured by the Priests and their followers,
and Temples throng with pilgrims from the outlands.
Feast of Bradyliam (27th of Fire): This is a feast held
by Elves across Titan to celebrate summer, a joyous
occasion of feasting, music, dance and magic. It is
also the time of the Game, an Elvish competitive
Ritual featuring two teams of ten players each (five
men and five women), who must compete to carry a
circular rock across a green grass field through the
opposing team’s territory. Each player competes
directly against their opponent and must move
twelve paces four times while suffering body blows.
NOTABLE DATES IN WATCHING
Watching is the eighth month of the year and the last
month of summer. It is sacred to the plant Goddess
Galana, for the farmers watch anxiously, hoping both
that their crops are ripening, and the rains hold off
long enough for them to be harvested. Much cider is
drunk, and festivities enjoyed through the warm
summer evenings.
The Trial of Champions (21st of Watching): In the
small but rich province of Chiang Mai in northern
Allansia, the people anticipate the birthday of their
liege-lord Baron Sukumvit, for that means the arrival
of the lethal festivity that the rest of Allansia knows
as the Trial of Champions. Also called “The Walk”,
this date every year sees a selection of brave heroes,
warriors and adventurers enter the snare-filled
labyrinth that is Deathtrap Dungeon. The winner,
and there has not been one for a while, will collect a
purse of 20,000 gold pieces (increased from 10,000
gold pieces when it was successfully completed for
the first and only time). For the week before the
contestants enter the underworld, they are feted
about town, wearing the violet scarves that denote
their participation in one of the most signature events
on the calendar for the serious hero or adventurer.
Who can survive Deathtrap Dungeon and triumph in
the Trial of Champions?
Feast of Limmannin (starts 23rd of Watching): This is
a two-day festival held in central and southern
Allansia to celebrate the end of the Tuberbeet harvest
and associated other ground-vegetable crops. In
Allansian villages such as Drystone and Coven,
tuberbeets, potatoes, turnips, cabbages, pumpkins
and other such vegetables will be judged by size,
weight, and appearance (humorous or otherwise).
Thanks are given to Galana and Limmannin (which is
another name for Cholumbara, God of agriculture).
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
NOTABLE DATES IN REAPING
Reaping is the ninth month of the year and the first
month of autumn. It is the holy month of
Cholumbara, God of agriculture, because it is when
the crops are harvested and gathered, and the bounty
of the land brought home to feed the village.
Summer’s
End
Tax
(start
1st
of
Reaping):
Unfortunately, when harvest time comes around,
everyone has to pay taxes, both in the cities and on
the land! A tax of 10 to 15 per cent of the value of the
crops and animals is imposed on farmers, while city
folk may pay anywhere from 2 to 25 per cent of their
wealth. Not for nothing are tax collectors despised!
The Duelling of Flames (17th of Reaping): This event
is held in the Forest of Yore and features the
graduation of apprentices from the School of Magic
as fully fledged Wizards, Sorcerers and other magic
users. It is also the premier spellcasting competition
in northern Allansia, a0racting not just recent
graduates but many other wandering Mages and
Warlocks keen to demonstrate their arcane abilities.
Autumn Equinox (23rd of Reaping): The Autumn or
Celestial Equinox marks the day when the celestial
hemispheres are in temporal alignment and the
number of hours of both daylight and the night are
exactly equal. It is considered a time of ending and
rebuilding, and Ritualistic ceremonies are held in
stone circles by Druids of the neutral Gods, such as
Galana, Throff, Glantanka, Farigiss, Lunara and
Titan. It was rumoured the Elven Queen of Sti0le
Woad could only consult the magical Vapours during
the night of the Celestial Equinox (though subsequent
events have shown this is false).
Archery Week (starts 26th of Reaping): While
Salamonis is also renowned for the tourneys and
jousts happening at this time, both of those events are
restricted to knights and warriors with Amonour.
Hence, Archery Week has become the most popular
competition as literally anyone can enter as long as
they have a bow and a quiver full of arrows. The
finals happen after seven days, following the Night of
Ancestors.
NOTABLE DATES IN HIDING
Hiding is the tenth month of the year and the second
month of autumn. It is dedicated to the Trickster God
Logaan, for it is a capricious time of year. After the
joyous harvest celebrations of Reaping, Hiding
signals the start of the slowing down. The land turns
from green to brown; those who live off the land
know that winter will soon be here again. As the
nights begin to darken earlier, families gather round
their fires. Soon it will be time for telling tales to chill
the blood and quicken the pulse.
Night of the Ancestors (first day of Hiding): In the
land of Kaypong, in the city-states around the
Glimmering Sea, and in many other more isolated
areas, the people celebrate the Night of the Ancestors,
where they welcome into their homes all the ghosts of
ancestors gone by.
Most years, this consists simply of an awful lot of
singing and  dancing, with everyone dressed in
ghoulish masks and costumes decorated to look like
skulls and skeletons. As dawn breaks, they run
yelping through every building and out through the
gates of the se0lement, symbolising the departure of
the ancestors’ spirits for another year.
However, perhaps every ten years or so (and usually
foreshadowed by the Spirit-watching Ritual the night
before), the ghosts of their ancestors take it upon
themselves to appear in person, whereupon the night
passes in a seriously happy Ritual dance of
celebration, with each reveller entwined in the arms
of ghostly forms which keep them dancing all night
until the spirits themselves flee, before the first rays of
the dawning sun can strike and imprison them upon
the Earthly Plane.
The Night of the Ancestors helps the people
rationalise the deaths of their loved ones and
demonstrates most forcefully that life and death are
inseparable on Titan.
Chapter 4 - The Calendar of Titan
NOTABLE DATES IN CLOSE
Close is the eleventh month of the year and the last
month of autumn. It is dedicated to Lunara, God of
the moon. The days are ge0ing very cold now, and on
the windswept plains that stretch across Allansia
there is the ever-present feeling of snow in the air. In
the far north, the Icefinger Mountains and the
Cragrock Peaks may be suffering storms and
blizzards already. Now is the time to be indoors!
Night of Shadows (11th of Close): In colder regions,
such as Frostholm and the Northlands of the Old
World, this date marks the Night of Shadows, a
religious event where people honour the animals,
beasts and creatures of the night. They may make a
short pilgrimage into the forest with offerings for the
Gods of the Animal Court, such as Almor, Gurrang,
Grush, Ski0a and Magir. Perhaps unsurprisingly
then, this date is also venerated as a holy day for
Were-creatures of all sorts, whether they be Werewolf
or Werebat, as a night where they hunt anyone failing
to bring them the proper gifts!
All-comers Fight to the Death (17th of Close):
Gladiatorial contests have been held on Titan since
Irritarian times, and current examples include the
Arena of Death on Blood Island and the Gladiatorial
Park of the free city of Ashkyos. One of the most
spectacular however is the All-comers Fight to the
Death at the Port Blacksand Sports Arena, the current
three-time titleholder of which is the legendary
Khulian pit-fighter Helios Siren.
Feast of Gold (24th of Close): In the city-states of the
Inland Sea, such as Tak and Lagash, this festival is
held to celebrate the end of the trading season, when
merchants (and pirates!) take stock of their profits
and losses for the year, and plan for the next. It is said
during such one such feast a wager was laid between
Captain Starg and Abdul the Butcher as to who was
the greatest pirate of the Inland Sea!
NOTABLE DATES IN LOCKING
Locking is the twelfth and last month of the year, and
the first month of winter. It is dedicated to Titan,
father of the Gods, who has enabled all to survive
another year, which draws to a close in a flurry of icy
weather. The fields are too hard for the farmers to
plough or dig up and the seas are too treacherous for
small fishing boats. It is a time for huddling before
the hearth, mending tools and telling tales.
The Wild Hunt (any day in Locking): On cold,
moonless nights in the middle of winter, when the
crop of fresh souls is running low because it is too
cold on the Earthly Plane for Evil humans to go
abroad and kill others, the Wild Hunt rides out across
the world, usually led by a Demon Prince. Sweeping
out of the midnight sky, the Wild Hunt of various
Demons, their infernal steeds and packs of
Hellhounds,
rampages
across
the
countryside
looking for isolated se0lements and farmsteads
where they can collect the souls they require, before
moving on to continue their fun.
Winter Solstice (23rd of Locking): The Winter
Solstice marks the shortest day and longest night of
the year. It is considered a time of death and rebirth,
and Ritualistic ceremonies are held by Elves, the Toa
Suo at Comrak’s Eye in the north, and also in stone
circles by Druids of the neutral Gods, such as
Farigiss, Throff, Glantanka, Lunara and Titan.
Year’s End/New Year (last 3-5 days of year): Year’s
End is the greatest of all festivals and is celebrated
almost universally among human races. Humans
celebrate the New Year in many ways. In Khul, the
highly religious citizens of Ximoran and Buruna
spend five days in solid prayer in their Temples,
stopping only on the evening of the fifth day for
feasting and celebration, activities which seem all the
more jubilant because of the sombre prayers
beforehand. In Analand the people celebrate with
hunting and fairs, with travelling traders se0ing up
in village markets to sell all kinds of exotic wares. In
Port Blacksand, however, Lord Azzur celebrates by
executing several prominent citizens (and then
kindly donating their riches to the city’s poor).

The Random Holy Day Generator
The tables below can be used to generate random
holy days for Gods who do not have listed holy days
in the previously depicted calendar of Titan. Simply
follow these steps:
Roll a die to determine how many holy days the God
has per year.
Roll
Number of Holy Days
1-3
4-5
Roll on the following table to determine the month
for each holy day.
Roll
Roll
Month
1-3
Freeze (31 days)
Dark (28 days)
Unlocking (31 days)
Sowing (30 days)
Winds (31 days)

Fire (31 days)
Watching (31 days)
Reaping (30 days)
Hiding (31 days)
Close (30 days)
Locking (28 days + 3 days for the New
Year celebration)
Next, work out the day.  Roll 1d6 and times it by 6.
Then roll one more d6 and add it to the first total.
This will generate the day.  Remember that some
months have less than 31 days, and also that if the
first dice was a 6, no second dice is needed as the date
will automatically be the 31st!
The Random Birthday Generator
These tables can also be used to randomly generate
the birthday of a Hero or other character as the
Director sees fit. It may be useful for example to know
the birthday of the local king or other ruler, who
usually has a celebration of some sort scheduled for
the date in question (e.g. Lord Azzur of Port
Blacksand). To randomly generate a birthday:
Deduct the Hero's age from the current year (285 AC)
to get the year of birth.
Roll on the two tables above to determine the month
and day of the birthday.
You can use the other randomised tables in this
chapter to determine the hour if needed, for example
to work out an astrological chart.
To find out which numbered year corresponds to
which Animal Sign, use the following chart.
Year   Animal Sign
