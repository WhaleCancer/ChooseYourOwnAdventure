Ymphos is the Goddess of Moths and other insects that flu0er about in the night, appearing as an enormous moth herself with mesmerising wings of black, blue and purple.

She sided with [Hmurresh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hmurresh) and [Hammurabi](Hammurabi.md) on the side of Evil and Chaos during the first battle; some of her offspring, such as Giant Moths (see Beyond the Pit, p89), have been carrying the mutating taint of Chaos ever since.

Ymphos is involved in a long-running battle with Hammurabi to curry Hmurresh's favour. Rumour has it she lost the latest wager and is currently cocooned in stasis in an ancient mausoleum somewhere within the Demonic Pit.

Ymphos is worshipped by Moth Men (see Return to the Pit, p134), and also by ancient scheming nocturnal sects in some decadent southern cities. Her chosen colour is purple, the deeper and darker the be0er, and her symbol is a moth.
