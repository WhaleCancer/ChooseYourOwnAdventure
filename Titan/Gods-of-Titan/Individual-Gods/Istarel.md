Istarel is the God of Forest Creatures who takes many forms, such as an Elven scout with an antlered head, or a silver unicorn (his favoured form), or even a mighty boar or golden stag. Istarel is one of the many Children of Erillia the Elf Mother (and known to humans as [Galana](Galana.md)), though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than fact, and he fought on the side of Good during the First Battle, alongside [Ski0a](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ski0a), the Stag God.

Istarel was thought by some to curse the human huntress Lama the Lithe after she butchered a Black Unicorn, causing her to spawn the race of Lamias. He is worshipped by Elves, Fairies and all Fey Folk who celebrate the joys of nature, as well as other forest races, such as Scurrellors and the more rustic Tuskers that are out there. The holy colour of Istarel is silver, and his symbol is that of a unicorn, while the Hour of the Unicorn is considered sacred for Istarel also.
