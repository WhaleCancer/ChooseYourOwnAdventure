## God of Shepherds

**Specific Power:** Call of the Shepherd

This power will force a nearby group of domesticated animals to obey the Priest for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score. They will defend the Priest from a0ack, but not otherwise pursue rash or foolish tasks. When this power ends, they will act as normal domesticated animals of their type. This power can affect 4-24 small creatures (such as chickens, ducks, cats, geese or turkeys), 2-12 medium sized creatures (including dogs, pigs, sheep and goats), or 1-6 large creatures (like horses, ca0le, water buffalo or camels).

**General Powers:**

- Create Food and Water
- Cure Poison and Disease
- Heal

Alongside [Cholumbara](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#cholumbara), Varantar is another agricultural Deity and either a child of [Galana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana) or a minor God under her protection.

He is worshipped as the Patron Demigod of shepherds and herders by animal-tending pastoralists across Titan. Known as Triastes in Allansia, Varantar appears as a tall man with a cloak and a hooked staff, a sling and a pair of pipes or a wooden flute at their side. The God of Shepherds is also worshipped (or at least acknowledged) by She-Satyrs, Satyrs, Centaurs, and other beast-races, but not by Minotaurs, Mooncalves, Chaos Centaurs, or Chaos Beast Men.

The holy colour of Varantar is brown and his sacred symbol is that of a shepherd's crook.
