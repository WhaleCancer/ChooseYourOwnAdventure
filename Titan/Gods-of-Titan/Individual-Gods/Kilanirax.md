Kilanirax is the Dragon King, the Lord of the Animal Court, boon companion to the sun Goddess [Glantanka](Glantanka.md), and with her and [Galana](Galana.md), responsible for discharging the fiery sphere that destroyed the God [Chronada](Chronada.md) and released Time into the Macrocosmos. Kilanirax appears as an immensely mighty Gold Dragon, blindingly powerful and wise beyond the aeons (some also note he has a propensity for occasionally disguising himself as a large ginger cat). His daughter is Chrysolla, mother of the Dracons with [Rogaar](Rogaar.md) the Golden Lion Lord, and Kilanirax is also the sworn enemy of that Evil Demigod, [The Night Dragon](The-Night-Dragon.md).

The Dragon King convened the foremost meeting of minds upon Titan, the grand Conclave of Dragons, whereby the smartest ancient Dragons of the six types that took the Dragon Oath (Black, Gold, Green, Red, Silver and White), meet to debate the current state of Titan and what can be done about it.

Kilanirax is paid fealty by all Dragons and Dragonlike creatures, especially sentient humanoids such as the Lizardines and the Dragon Men. These latter two peoples were supposedly created by Gwarthran, a legendary Priestess of Kilanirax, in an area near the present city-state of Zamarra, and some hoary traditions of this legacy linger on in the mystical Seven Levels of the Wazarri Sect. Elsewhere, the lost city of Vatos in the Desert of Skulls was purported to host an ancient tomb of the Dragon King's High Priests, while an underground shrine called the Labyrinth of the Dragon exists beneath Darkwood Forest.

Finally, one of the few currently functioning human Temples dedicated to Kilanirax can be found in the Glimmering Sea city-state of Alkemis, where the Sage-Priest Landor Shanzul is a noted scholar on Dragon lore.

Because of Kilanirax's standing as Lord of the Animal Court, and his courage during the First Battle, the constellation bearing his name can be seen in the northern skies, and the first year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Dragon.

The holy symbol of Kilanirax is a dragon and his sacred colour is gold. The Hour of the Dragon is considered sacred for Kilanirax.
