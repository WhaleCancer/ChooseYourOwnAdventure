Furlakk is the God of frogs and other amphibians, including toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians. On Titan he is worshipped by swamp-dwelling races, and though not inherently Evil, Furlakk does accept sacrificial victims from devious marsh-loving miscreants such as Toadmen, Chrabats, Grupplers, Kokomokoa and Giant Horntoads, as well as the offerings of more peaceable races including Fen Folk, Kreehuls and the Slykk. Shamans who venerate Furlakk wear green or brown robes, and the symbol of the God is a frog, often rendered as a jade or golden amulet.
