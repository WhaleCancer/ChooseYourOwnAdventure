## God of Life

**Specific Power:** The Spark of Life

During combat this power lasts for as many A0ack Rounds as the Priest's Devotion score; outside of combat it lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score. The Priest may cause all inanimate non-living objects within 5m to become animated hindering enemies of the Priest. The effect will vary with the number of objects in the affected area but will cause all enemies within this area to suffer a penalty to any and all physical actions, including combat. A dusty cloud of motes may induce a penalty of -1 as it blinds and gets up one's nose, while a hail of large rocks could cause a penalty as high as -5.

**General Powers:**

- Create Food and Water
- Cure Disease and Poison
- Heal

Vuh is the God that embodies the Breath of Life, the spark from which activity is summoned, initiating a response that will flourish in either light or darkness. Along with [Ashra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ashra) and [Elim](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#elim), they were one of the primal deities, that flourished after Arn the First God and before the reign of [Titan](Titan.md) and his pantheon of younger Gods. Their worship has largely faded from the more populous regions of Titan who now pay tribute to later deities.

Elves know Vuh as Maëlla, a feminine Goddess of life force that enables plants and animals to live and grow, and manifests in the Elven Powers of dream magic and shamanism in particular. Interestingly, Vuh is depicted as a large and extravagant tree, adorned with vines and creepers, whose trunk and boughs are home to all forms of life. Their holy symbol is a leaf and their sacred colour is green.
