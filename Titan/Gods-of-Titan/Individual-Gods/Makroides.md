Makroides is the God of Crabs and other crustaceans, including lobsters, shrimp, crayfish, prawns, hermit crabs and barnacles. He is associated with [Hydana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana), [Aqualis](Aqualis.md) and [Ichthys](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ichthys), and a sworn enemy of [Behemoth](Behemoth.md), Chaos Demigod of the Sea.

Appearing as a gigantic scarlet crab with enormous curve-clawed pincers, Makroides is worshipped by fishermen, especially in places such as Lobster Sands and the Port of Crabs, as well as by inhuman creatures including Krell, Crab Folk, and the Exo-Beast.

There are rumours of Shrines raised on isolated islands from driftwood by such fishermen, with the doorway formed of a pair of gigantic crab claws from a real monster, even among Giant Crabs! There is a rumour in Port Blacksand that Halron Allierté, tavern keeper of the Black Lobster, is a secret follower of the Crab God! The sacred colour of Makroides is red, and his symbol is a stylised crab.
