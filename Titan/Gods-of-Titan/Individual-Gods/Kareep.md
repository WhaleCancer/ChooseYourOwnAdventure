Brother of [Shreech the Rat King](Shreech-the-Rat-King.md), Kareep (also spelled Karreep) is the God of Mice and other small furry mammals. Everyone remembers the story of how Kareep was eaten by [Suthis Cha](Suthis-Cha.md) the Lizard God and thus missed the First Battle, whether by accident or design!

Kareep's followers are both rare and obscure but include the subterranean Mouselings, and possibly others such as the Molekin (whose version of Kareep takes the form of a mole). There are no known human Temples to Kareep, although there are a few wandering Priests to this God who move from farm to farm and village to village in the rural areas. Anywhere with a granary lives in constant fear of a plague of mice, and so pay a few coins to ensure their crop remains mouse-free. One condition though is that they never keep a cat!

Despite missing the First Battle, the seventh year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Mouse. The holy colour of Kareep is grey, and his symbol is that of a mouse.
