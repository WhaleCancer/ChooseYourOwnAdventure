Elim is the Dark One, the shadow that falls upon a soul, as it departs along the Road of Trials towards the Spirit Plane. Some call him Balgoth, the Dweller in Darkness, or the Great Enemy, who seeks to return the world to the state of primordial Chaos.

Along with [Ashra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ashra) and [Vuh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#vuh), they were one of the primal deities that flourished after [Arn](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#arn) the First God and before the reign of [Titan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#titan) and his pantheon of younger Gods. As such, the worship of Elim has largely faded from the more populous regions of Titan who pay tribute to later deities.

Traces of his Evil still remain however, in the cursed ruins on the shores of eastern Allansia, or the Dark Disciples of the lost city of Vatos in the Desert of Skulls, or even the rumours of the resurrection of Sargon, last high Priest of Elim, and his gathering army of Elimite cultists. Elim is still worshipped also by non-human creatures such as Brain Slayers. The holy symbol of Elim is a dark cloud, and his sacred colour is black.
