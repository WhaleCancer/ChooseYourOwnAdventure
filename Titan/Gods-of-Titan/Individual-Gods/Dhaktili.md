**Demigod of the Underearth**

**Specific Power:** Claws of the BoEomless Pit

Two enormous, red-furred hands with curved claws (some say belonging to Dhaktili himself), erupt from the ground and grab as many enemies as the Priest's Devotion score. These targets will not be able to move, and will have a penalty of -2 to their actions until they escape, which requires a full round and a successful Strength Special Skill roll (or a SKILL test).

**General Powers:**

- Banish
- Curse
- Weakness

Dhaktili is the God of the Underearth, the Master of the Dungeon, the Lord of Caves, Caverns and Catacombs. He is worshipped by many subterranean races, especially Kobolds, Craggeracks, [Troglodytes](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Troglodytes.md), Gleff, Gremlins (who know him as Thagral the Red), N'yadachs and Cavern Elves.

As one would expect for an underworld Deity, Dhaktili's perceived form varies widely; Troglodytes regard him as a protean Deity of ever-changing form, surmounted by a golden skull, while Gremlins consider him a great red clawed hand, always clutching at the tangled threads of life in the underworld. Kobolds and their relatives think Dhaktili resembles a fat humanoid figure with a friendly, smiling face and outstretched arms; conversely, to the Cavern Elves and others, he is Vacavon, a grotesque, snarling, tusked creature of the darkness. His holy symbol is a clawed hand, or, more rarely, a skull inside a triangle, and his sacred colour is red. Some Priests are known to wear a Ring of Indescribable Horrors to show their devotion to Dhaktili.
