## The God of Thieves

**Specific Power:** Filch

When the Priest invokes this power, any one small hand-held object within range, that is visibly held by another, magically disappears and reappears in the hand of the Priest. At the Director's discretion, the object must be small or light enough to be held by one hand only. The range of this power is equal to the Priest's Devotion score in metres.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Cure Poison and Disease
- Ill-Luck

[Logaan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#logaan) the Trickster God is typically depicted with two shadowy accomplices called Kata and [Petros](Petros.md), who appear as faceless humans in dark robes. What few realise is that these mysterious entities are Demigods in their own right. Kata, Logaan's right "hand", for example, is the God of Thieves, often invoked by rogues across Titan but never explicitly named, for fear of jinxing a heist or mission.

The more devout Thieves' Guilds in larger cities may even have a small shrine to Kata at which thieves can make offerings before or after a hopefully successful "quiet job". It is often mistakenly assumed that Kata and Petros represent Logaan being pulled in the direction of Good or Evil, when in fact both Demigods reflect the two choices of true Neutrality, inaction or avoidance, in the case of Kata, and direct action or reaction for Petros.

The sacred colour of Kata is black, and their symbol takes the form of a hand.
