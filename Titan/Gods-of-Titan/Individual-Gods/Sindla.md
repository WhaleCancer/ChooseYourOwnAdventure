Sindla is worshipped right across the world of Titan, often by a different name, and is considered one of the major Gods. Her other names include Cheelah, Gredd, Avana, Zaragillia, Castis, Bismen, Juvenar, Lhyss, and Lady Luck and Mistress Fate (the latter of which is an independent demiurge in her own right, known as Zorna).

With luck and fate as her providence, her name is invoked regularly in everyday speech, as in: "May Sindla watch over you." In that respect, Sindla may be the most popular Goddess on Titan. Few others are mentioned on a daily basis by the ordinary folk and few other Gods have their holy symbol worn by non-faithful.

She is the sister of [Titan](Titan.md), and has three daughters: [Asrel](Asrel.md), [Libra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#libra), and [Usrel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#usrel), and is usually portrayed as an aged but handsome dark-haired woman in white robes, with a headband adorned with eye-like symbols.

Her Priests wear white, and a pair of dice are her symbol. Holy days of Sindla include the 20th of Watching and the 22nd and 26th of Close.
