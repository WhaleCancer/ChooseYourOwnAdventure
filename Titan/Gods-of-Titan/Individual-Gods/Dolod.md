The Southerners who now dwell in the ancient Khulian city of Zagoula worship an obscure pantheon of Evil Gods. Chief of these is Dolod the Howling God, who demands human sacrifices at his immense Temple, on a sun-blasted plain just outside the city. Dolod appears as an unnaturally handsome man whose mouth is too large, for it contains hundreds of writhing tentacle-like tongues. Dolod's colour is red, and his symbol is an Evil eye.
