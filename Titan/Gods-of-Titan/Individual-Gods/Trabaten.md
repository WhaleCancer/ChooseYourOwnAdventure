Trabaten is an Evil Demigod allied to the [Demon Prince](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#demon-princes) [Ishtra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ishtra). He is the Patron God of torturers (exenteration means the practice of disembowelling a victim), obscure cults such as the Acolytes of Pain, and is also worshipped by other foul beings such as Chaos Warriors and the Kassistra or Cobra People.

The Temples of Trabaten are almost always hidden away from the sight of civilised people due to the u0er revulsion they create. Anyone unfortunate enough to see the inside of one is either a member of the awful cult or is a victim taken there for a long and terrible sacrifice.

Not only is the worship of this God completely proscribed in every civilised region, there is no restriction on what can be done to the Priests if discovered…

He appears as a tall man in a dark robe, whose skin is dyed red with the blood of a million sacrificial victims, and whose hands hold two long barbed daggers. The chosen colour of Trabaten is red, and his symbol is a blood-stained knife.
