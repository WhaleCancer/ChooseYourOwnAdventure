## The Orc Champion

**Specific Power:** Powerful Blow

This power allows the Priest, or an ally that they can touch with their bare hand, to land their first blow in a combat with incredible power and strength. In practice, this means that in any combat the recipient of the power will cause double damage for the first (and only the first) successful blow they strike.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Incite
- Smite versus all Good beings

Urk Wolfrider is the legendary Orc hero who fought alongside [Almor](Almor.md) the Wolf God on the side of Evil during the First Battle. This is relatively common among the goblinoids; a great "Hero" arises, achieves great deeds (at least from the viewpoint of the Goblins) and is then killed in a suitably heroic way. This "Hero" is then elevated to the status of Demigod, even if the Deity responsible is never quite clear, and that Demigod is then the object of worship!

Immortalised as a Demigod among Orcs and all related races, Urk is regarded as the paragon of Orcability; strong, brave, and always up for a good scrap, clad in battle-worn mail armour and wielding an enormous, iron-grey two-handed sword.

His name comes from the first words of his creator Hashak's newly-formed creatures: "Urk! Urk!"

Because of Urk's courage during the First Battle, the constellation bearing his name as the Orc Champion can be seen in the southern skies of Titan. The symbol of Urk is the stylised face of an Orc warrior and his holy colour is green.
