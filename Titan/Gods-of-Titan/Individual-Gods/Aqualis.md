## God of Rivers

**Specific Power:** Anger of Aqualis

The Priest may cause one short section of river or stream to behave as if it were fast rapids, knocking anyone or anything in the section over, and potentially even washing them away. Any swimming tests made within the fast river will have a penalty of -4. The rapids will last for a number of minutes equal to the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Commune
- Heal
- Ward

The son of [Throff](Throff.md) and [Hydana](Hydana.md), this major God is truly of both the earth and the sea. His full brothers are [Farigiss](Farigiss.md) and [Atlan](Atlan.md), and his half-brothers are [Lorodil](Lorodil.md) and [Verlang](Verlang.md). In ancient Djarat, Aqualis took the form of a man with the head of a crocodile, and was known as Cracca, Ferryman of the Gods.

In modern times, any major nation or settlement that depends on a large river generally worships Aqualis in the river's own name, so that in Arantis he is known as Eltus and in Lagash he is known as Parine. There are even rumours of a decrepit building deep in the docklands of Kharé, cityport of traps, rumoured to pay worship to Aqualis in the name of the fearsome Jabaji!

Shrines to Aqualis can be found in many towns and villages along major rivers, and can also be found at fords, ferries and bridges. His Priests wear pale brown robes, and his symbol is the swan. Holy days of Aqualis include the 20th of Unlocking and the Festival of the Waters, which begins earlier that month on the 5th of Unlocking.
