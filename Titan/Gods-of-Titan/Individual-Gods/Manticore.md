The Manticore is the God of Monstrous Beasts, who fought for Evil during the First Battle, and was unleashed by the [Dark Lords](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md) upon Titan during the Deep Night. Their Priesthood is minimal; there are the fragments of a cult in the city of Arion. This is based around the ruin of a Temple in Manticore Yard within the city (see Travels in Arion, p51), and watched over by an old man known only as the Scorpion and last of the Keepers of the Manticore.

The Scorpion has been known to claim the Manticore God, sleeping in magical stasis, is buried beneath Manticore Yard in a series of dungeons and catacombs; no one knows if this is true or not. Other such ragged sects may possibly exist elsewhere, but in general the Manticore is only acknowledged by creatures of the same name, Chimeras, Nine-Tails, and other misshapen hybrid beasts.

Nevertheless, because of the Manticore's standing, the constellation bearing their name can be seen in the southern skies of Titan. The holy colour of the Manticore is red, and their symbol is a stylised rampant beast of the same name. The Hour of the Manticore is considered sacred for them as well.
