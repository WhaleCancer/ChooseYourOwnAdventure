Xoromik the Ant-Queen Goddess is venerated by several strange races including Antmen, Ant Symbiotes and the Xoroa. She appears as a gargantuan queen ant, with the head of a human female, and a gigantic pulsating sac-like body that is constantly spawning eggs.

Although there are no known human worshippers of Xoromik, there are rumours of vast subterranean Temple complexes created by the Xoroa. Vast caverns that far exceed the size and grandeur of any surface Temple, these places are controlled by large numbers of Priests, even larger numbers of holy guards and a0ended by truly incredible numbers of worshippers. Some of these Xoroan Temples even have their own associated fungal farms, mines and other resources and can be considered cities in their own right.

Her sacred colour is yellow and her symbol is an ant. The Xoroans, not normally known for wearing clothes, nevertheless make an exception for some of their Priests who wear a yellow cowl woven from fungal fibres.
