Hammurabi is the Lord of the Flies and a Demigod serving under the Fly Queen [Hmurresh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hmurresh). He is constantly embroiled in schemes against other insect Gods, such as Ymphos and Khepra Dark-Shell.

This extends to some of his Priesthood of Insectoid Monks, who seem to go out of their way to pick fights with rival clerics. In appearance he is a gigantic dragonfly with fifteen-metre wings, gleaming multi-faceted eyes, and great curved mandibles.

He has a following in some distant kingdoms, such as Hachiman, and is also worshipped by the mysterious nomadic race of insectoid creatures known as the Scourge. Hammurabi's colour is emerald-green and his symbol is that of a dragonfly.
