Chronada is the somewhat obscure God of Time, worshipped primarily by Sorcerer-Priests in Kakhabad and the mysterious stronghold of Throben, among and beyond the Zanzunu Peaks. The Archmage of Mampang in High Xamen, fashioned the Seventh Serpent from a Hydra's head into a reptilian incarnation of the God of Time. Held hostage by the [Dark Lords](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md) for a brief period, Chronada was destroyed during the First Battle by a combined firebolt from [Galana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana), [Glantanka](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#glantanka) and [Kilanirax](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kilanirax) (but, in so far as Gods can die, he was transmuted and reborn again), causing the release of Time into the world, though even now these temporal forces are definitely not evenly distributed.

Some scholars consider Chronada one of the primal deities alongside [Ashra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ashra), [Vuh](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#vuh) and [Elim](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#elim), but these beliefs are by no means universally accepted.

Chronada is also worshipped by [Dwarfs](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md), who call him Krullinzeth, the Lord of Days, and also pay homage to his three daughters, known as the Sisters of Time. A major artefact of Chronada is the Key to the Door of Time. The holy colour of Chronada is white, reflecting the fading of all things over time, and his symbol is an hourglass.
