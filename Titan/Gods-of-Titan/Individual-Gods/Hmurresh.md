One of the Evil Beast Gods, Hmurresh is Queen of the Flies, and associated with both [Disease](Disease.md) and [Decay](Decay.md). She is rarely worshipped in her own right, except in fly-blown wasteland settlements such as Shakuru and Alasiyan. She is believed to dwell on the Elemental Plane of Air, from where she dispatches her subjects to bring plague and pestilence to all corners of the world.

However, she does also have a few Priests, that wear black and have a fly as their symbol. Hmurresh sometimes gifts an enchanted artefact known as the Helm of Pestilence (see Demons of Doom, p56) to her most devout followers. Holy days of Hmurresh include the 25th of Unlocking.

The few isolated Temples to Hmurresh are unpleasant places to visit, even for the devout followers of this God. They are always swarming with flies of all kinds, from tiny ones that can barely be seen to huge buzzing monstrosities the size of a human thumb. The Priest of course is not bothered by the hundreds of flies crawling across their skin and robes, but visitors are usually not so stolid!
