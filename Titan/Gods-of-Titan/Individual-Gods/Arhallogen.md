Arhallogen the Lord of Spiders is a close companion of [Death](Death.md) but is also directly opposed to [Hmurresh](Hmurresh.md) the Fly Queen and appears as an enormous black hairy spider with red staring eyes and glistening white fangs. His companion is the Spider Goddess Veracna, his brother is Rikat the Scorpion God, and he is worshipped by some non-humans including Troglodytes, Dark Elves, and Spider People.

There are rumours of great caverns deep below the surface that are dedicated as great cathedrals to Arhallogen, the vaulted ceilings hung with webs and the floors a great nursery for spiderlings.

Arhallogen also has a few human acolytes, in particular in the south, where Spider Cults are much-feared, who wear black robes and have a spider as a symbol. His followers favour poison as a weapon, usually smeared across their dagger or machete.

Because of Arhallogen's standing, the thirteenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Spider, and the constellation bearing his name can also be seen in the southern skies. In Khul, the month of Skies in Darkness is sacred to Arhallogen. The Holy days of Arhallogen include the 23rd of Freeze.
