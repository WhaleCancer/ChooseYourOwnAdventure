**Masters of the Pit**

**Specific Power:** Summon Demonic Energy

This power allows the Priest to summon the demonic energy of the Pit and use it magically in one of three different ways, as follows:

- **Summon Demonspawn:** This summons a single Demonspawn to aid the Priest. The Demonspawn will serve the Priest faithfully for as many hours as the Priest's Devotion score.
- **Energy Blast:** This summons a black energy bolt that causes 2-12 STAMINA damage on a single target, with an Armour Roll allowed.
- **Demonic Command:** This is as per the Command spell and does not require touch to work. It only works on Demons who have a SKILL score of 12 or less. It will last for as many hours as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Banish
- Curse
- Ill-Luck

## Demon Prince Sigils

Below are the sigils of the three most powerful Demon Princes; the Snake Demons Sith, Ishtra and Myurr. Followers will have a holy symbol in the form of the sigil and may have it ta0ooed or even branded on their skin!

**Ishtra**
Sacred Colour: Green

**Myurr**
Sacred Colour: Purple

**Sith**
Sacred Colour: Red

Traditionally, there have been considered to be seven main Demon Princes of the abyssal Pit. There are the three Snake Demons; Ishtra, Myurr and Sith (the latter worshipped by Evil Djaratians as a God in her own right named Sithera), who are the Rulers of the Pit, and the four Night Demons; Kalin, Relem, Shakor, and Vradna, who are the Generals of the Legions of the Damned.

Other Demon Princes do exist however, and some of the infernal royalty present among the foremost ranks of the Pit's eligible hideous overlords would include Akragog, Baphet, Rivel, Gargan, Morpheus, Ulrakaah, the nameless Doom Demon, Gagrash, and his twin brother Agrash the Necro-Demon, the Kurakil, and the second incarnation of Zanbar Bone as a Skeleton Demon, among many others.

The Demon Princes are actively worshipped by [Dark Elves](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Dark-Elves-Servants-of-the-Night.md), Brain Slayers, [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md), [Goblins](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Goblins-The-Children-of-Evil.md), [Trolls](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md), the Caarth, and the [Lizard Men](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Lizard-Men-of-the-Southern-Jungles.md) of Silur Cha, and secretively worshipped by weird cults in old and decadent cities of the human lands. The symbol and colour of a Demon Prince vary considerably (see below for more information). The Demon Princes actively create Demonic Items of imbued power with which to corrupt weak but influential individuals to the corrupting ways of the Pit.

A full list may not be possible, but note must be taken of the following Demonic Items and their sponsors: the Ring of Night (by Relem; see Demons of Doom, p56-57), the Bow of the Hellsnake (by Myurr; see Demons of Doom, p58), the Flame from the First Ba0le (kept by Ishtra, see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p147), and the Gem of the Snake Demon (possessed by Ishtra, Myurr and Sith; see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p148). Holy days of Sith (in her form as Sithera, Goddess of Evil), include the 13th of Watching.
