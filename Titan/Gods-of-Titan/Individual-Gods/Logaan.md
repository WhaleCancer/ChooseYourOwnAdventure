This power must affect all in the vicinity or none.

One of the most enigmatic of Gods, Logaan is also one of the major Gods, and known by many different names, such as Hazah, Ranjan, Akolyra and the Trickster. He is widely credited with creating humans at the beginning of the world and discovering [Chronada](Chronada.md), God of time.

Logaan considers himself the lynch-pin of all creation, between Law and Chaos, and between Good and Evil. Followers of Logaan believe all must be in balance and neither extreme should dominate.

He is often depicted as a robed, crazed-looking man, hair all askew, being restrained by the mysterious twin Gods [Kata](Kata.md) and [Petros](Petros.md). Logaan's many and varied servants and worshippers include Genies, the Netherworld Sorcerers, the Riddling Reaver, Leprechauns, Elvins, and many humans, including denizens of Shazâar, City of Madness, which hosts the Lucre Week celebration in Logaan's honour, beginning on the 3rd week of Warming.

This habit of acquiring interesting and able servants on the mortal plain is almost unique amongst the Gods. All of the Gods (well, most) have their Priests on Titan, some have Prophets or Chosen Ones and some will even have Demons or similar that work directly for them. But the more esoteric of those are commanded to visit Titan and Priests are usually volunteers to that role. Those "chosen" by Logaan to be his agents in the mortal world are normally thrust into the role by fate or chance, and find themselves working for the Trickster without realising it had happened.

The benefits of such a role are also varied. Some become almost immortal, gaining significant magical powers and able to make significant changes in local regions at least. Others find themselves with a minor additional boon and nothing more. Either way, the "chosen" is a pawn of Logaan and even though they have the impression of free will, they are in the end causing chaos and unrest at the behest of their ultimate master.

His Priests wear multi-coloured robes, and his symbol is either a two-headed arrow or a six-pointed star, representing balance or "anything". The magical artefact known as the Rainbow Potion (see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p143) is thought to be one of Logaan's pranks, likewise the Nonsense Gem (see Citadel of Chaos, p26), and the mysterious Dice of Logaan.

The Allansian month of Hiding is dedicated to Logaan, as is the Khulian month of Nature's Curling. Holy days of Logaan include the 12th of Warming and the 7th of Hiding, as well as the Leaping Festival which starts on the 1st of Sowing and lasts for a week.
