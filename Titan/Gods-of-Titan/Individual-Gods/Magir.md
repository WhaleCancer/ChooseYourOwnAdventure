Magir the Tiger God fought alongside his siblings [Rogaar](Rogaar.md), [Meerar](Meerar.md) and [Sku-Rachi](Sku-Rachi.md) during the First Battle on the side of Good. He appears as a great golden tiger with black stripes, often dancing across the air and suffused with light; legends state Magir guards the Lost City of Kharnek in southern Allansia. Magir is lord of tigers and associated species, including Fangtigers, Snow Tigers, and Sabre-Toothed Tigers.

He is worshipped by Weretigers, certain cults in Glimmering Sea city-states like Agra and Alkemis, and weird mutant tigerish humanoids sometimes seen in central Khul, such as those accompanying Shanzikuul the Master of Chaos.

Because of Magir's standing, the fifth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Tiger, while in central Allansia lies Mount Magir, one of the Three Tiger Mountains on the edge of the Plain of Bronze. The sacred colours of the Tiger God are orange and black, and his symbol is that of a snarling tiger. Many Priests obtain magical ta0oos bearing this same image. The Hour of the Tiger is considered holy for Magir.
