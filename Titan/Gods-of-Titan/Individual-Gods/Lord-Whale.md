Lord Whale, God of cetaceans, fought the [Behemoth](Behemoth.md) and the [Sea Monster](Sea-Monster.md) during the First Battle, alongside [Hydana](Hydana.md), [Ichthys](Ichthys.md) and [Makroides](Makroides.md), and because of his courage the constellation bearing his name can be seen in the northern skies of Titan.

Some say Lord Whale now lives on the Elemental Plane of Water, engaged in an endless hunt against the Sea Monster. All whales pay allegiance to the Lord, from dolphins to Bullwhales, and from narwhals to Blubber Whales. Some say the legendary Black Whale is the avatar or even the progeny of the Lord, as it cruises the infamous Eelsea; certainly the Deity is said to take the form of an immense Bullwhale of unrivalled speed and power.

Grizzled whalers of the Eelsea, the Diamond Islands, and the Dragon Reaches, offer prayers to Lord Whale before they set out to sea, in order to find the right ones to hunt and to avoid the more dangerous types. The venerated colour of Lord Whale is grey, and his holy symbol takes the form of a dolphin.
