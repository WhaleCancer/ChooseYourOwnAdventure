Arkelon is the God of turtles, terrapins, and tortoises, and also known by other epithets, such as Yur-Tël, the Turtle King, Ghumhera, or the Lord of the Pond. He fought alongside [Hydana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana) during the First Battle, against Karkara the Shark Goddess, and takes the form of a gargantuan sea turtle with a shiny ebon carapace.

Arkelon is largely worshipped by the obscure race of Chelonians, who dwell in the warmer seas and archipelagos of Titan, especially the Shining Islands, and by strange cults in far-off lands such as the Isles of the Dawn. His sacred colour is green and his symbol is a turtle.

No-one has ever reported what form the Chelonian Temples deep beneath the waves take, but those on land are usually roofed with a huge shell from a Giant Turtle, using palm tree trunks as columns. There will be little more in the way of decoration or ornamentation, although if there is, it will be smaller turtle shells carved with intricate designs. As followers of Arkelon are banned from hunting Giant Turtles, the cult will use a shell washed up on the beach, and is seen as a sign that their God requires a new Temple!
