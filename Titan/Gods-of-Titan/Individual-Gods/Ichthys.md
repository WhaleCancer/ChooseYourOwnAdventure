Ichthys is the God of Fish, and swam alongside [Hydana](Hydana.md) in the First Battle, fighting against Karkara, [Behemoth](Behemoth.md) and the [Sea Monster](Sea-Monster.md). He takes the form of an immense grouper-like fish, with eyes like black pools, deep indigo scales and a mouth full of spiky teeth. Ichthys is said to live in the Palace of the Pearl on the celestial plane known as the Eternal Ocean.

Some say the gigantic piscine Behemoths (the giant fish monster, not the tentacled chaos God of the same name), known from all twelve seas of Titan, are the children of the Fish God.

Ichthys is worshipped by fishermen hoping for a good catch, as well as such exotic races as the Fish Men, Pelagines, the humanoid Swordfish and possibly the Elkiem. Because of Ichthys' standing, the second year in the eight-year cycle that reckons time in the remote Khulian kingdom of Hachiman, is known as the Year of the Fish. The revered colour of Ichthys is dark blue, and his symbol is a fish.
