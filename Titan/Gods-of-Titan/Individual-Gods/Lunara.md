Lunara, God of the Moon, is a Deity about whom much confusion reigns. Considered by some to always be male, and by others to definitely be female, they are known by many names across Titan.

In some lands, such as Allansia or Analand, they are depicted as a female Goddess with silver hair and eyes, wandering through moonlit orchards of silver apple trees.

In other lands they are depicted as a white or grey robed male God, and known as Lord Moon, Tiriel the Silent Guardian (by the Dark Elves), Kuran by the people of south-east Allansia, and Phlanx by secretive cults of Moon-Worshippers in nations like Femphrey and Gallantaria.

This ambiguity extends to their allegiances, as Lunara is also considered the Patron God of Were-Creatures and weird beasts such as Mooncalves.

Hags also pay them fealty, acknowledging Lunara's waning and waxing pull over the lands once night has fallen. Because of Lunara's standing and this powerful dichotomy of forms, the fifth and sixth years in the eight-year cycle that reckons time in the remote Khulian kingdom of Hachiman, are known as the Year of the First Moon and the Year of the Second Moon, respectively.

The holy colour of Lunara is white, and their symbol is that of a white sphere. Some accord Lunara the symbol of the crescent moon, though this is only in lands where there are no [Shekka](Shekka.md) worshippers!

For more information about Lunara in their role as the moon in the night skies of Titan, see Chapter 4.

The Allansian month of Close is holy to Lunara, as is Spiritday in Khul and Moonsday in Allansia and the Old World, as well as the Hour of the Moon, which begins at midnight. Holy days of Lunara include the 26th of Freeze, the 13th of Fire, the 21st of Reaping, and the 6th of Close.
