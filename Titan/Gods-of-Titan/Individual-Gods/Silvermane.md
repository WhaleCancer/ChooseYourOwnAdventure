## The Centaur Hero

**Specific Power:** Charge of the Centaurs

This power allows the Priest to charge into battle as if imbued with the legendary power of Silvermane himself. The Priest may add +1 STAMINA to all physical damage they inflict upon their opponent and also push them back two metres if the enemy is Ogre-sized or smaller and if at least 2 STAMINA points of damage are inflicted. This power lasts for as many A0ack Rounds as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Bravery
- Sanctuary

Silvermane is the legendary Centaur hero who fought on the side of Good during the First Battle, alongside [Hunnynhaa](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hunnynhaa) the Stallion God, and was subsequently deified after death to become a constellation in the southern hemisphere of Titan.

He appears as a handsome Centaur warrior with long silvery hair, and a curved bow in one hand. Silvermane is worshipped by the Centaurs, whose shamans sing many epic songs in his honour. Some Chaos Centaurs reject Silvermane as a traitor, as they consider him responsible for the curse of their existence, when, as an original horse he was first domesticated by humans and subsequently burdened with the form of a Centaur.

The holy symbol of Silvermane is a rearing Centaur and, appropriately enough, his chosen colour is silver.
