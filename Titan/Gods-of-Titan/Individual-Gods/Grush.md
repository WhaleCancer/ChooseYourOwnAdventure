Grush is the God of boars, pigs, warthogs and other suine ungulates upon the face of Titan. He is affiliated with [Istarel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#istarel), the Elven God of forest creatures, and fought alongside them in the armies of Good during the First Battle.

Grush manifests as a towering razorback hell-pig, with great curved tusks on both upper and lower jaws, tufted tubercles adorning his skull and a mane of black hair running down his spine from a crest on the top of his head.

While honoured by pig-farmers and others who work with swine, including the infamous "Pigboy" Snouter, owner of the Slime and Swine Gu0ery of Salamonis, he is also Patron Deity of the races of Tuskers and Zwinians, whom he created with magical clay during the Godtime. The sacred colour of Grush is red, and his symbol is that of a pig.

It is also not unknown for hunting parties to make a donation to a Shrine of Grush before undertaking an expedition. Wild Boar are more than capable of killing a Hunter or his horse, and by paying respect to their Patron Deity first the hunter hopes to avoid such a fate.
