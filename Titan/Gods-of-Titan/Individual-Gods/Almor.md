Almor the Wolf Lord is the older brother of Durrak
the Dog God, but fought against him in the First
Ba0le, alongside Urk the Orc Champion for Evil and
Chaos. He is also associated with Lunara the Moon
Goddess in some cultures as well. Almor appears as
an immense devil-like wolf with ash-grey fur,
flaming eyes and a mouth full of gli0ering fangs.
He is worshipped by a variety of societies, including
Orcs (especially wolf-riders), many Barbarian tribes,
and Werewolves. The Mauristatian principality of
Lupravia is even reputed to be ruled by overlords
who are strict adherents to the Way of the Wolf.
The holy colour of Almor is grey and his symbol is a
wolf, often depicted howling at the moon. Because of
Almor's standing, the tenth year in the twenty-year
Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as
the Year of the Wolf, and the constellation bearing his
name can also be seen in the southern skies alongside
the Orc Champion Urk.
The Hour of the Wolf at dusk is considered sacred for
Almor. Orcs hold a sacred feast for Almor on the 5th
of Reaping.
