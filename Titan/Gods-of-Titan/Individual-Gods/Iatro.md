Iatro is the White Queen, She who Heals and Succours, the Goddess of Solace and the love of life, and one of the many Children of Erillia the Elf Mother (and known to humans as [Galana](Galana.md)). She appears as an Elven maiden in a white robe, with skin like moonlight, large eyes like liquid emeralds, and her brown hair bound in a circlet of white flowers.

Iatro is worshipped mainly by Elves, Fairies and other Fey Folk, but she has human followers as well. The Church of the White Queen is an ancient and mysterious religion with many far-flung outposts. There is a big following among the islands of the Arrowhead Archipelago, including the legendary Lady Iola of Stayng, while in Salamonis there is a healing well shrine dedicated to her. Iatro loathes the Undead, and her senior Priestesses are rumoured to have some knowledge of Arcane or Primal Magic, such as the Charm of Unbinding, that instantly destroys such creatures! The holy colour of Iatro is white, and her symbol is that of a heart-shaped leaf.
