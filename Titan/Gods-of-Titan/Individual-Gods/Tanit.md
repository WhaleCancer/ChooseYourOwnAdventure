**Goddess of Envy and Jealousy**

**Specific Power:** Envy of Tanit

Once per day, the Priest may cause one target within 10 metres to lust after a particular item known to be held by someone else. The victim will, for the duration of the effect, do everything in their power to gain the item, attacking if necessary, but only if other methods fail. This power will last for a number of A0ack Rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Ill-Luck
- Incite

The sister of [Slangg](Slangg.md), Tanit is also primarily worshipped in Kharé. Directly opposed to the works of [Asrel](Asrel.md), Goddess of love, Tanit only has Priestesses, who are subtle and a0empt to subvert friendships and encourage envy.

She is sinisterly portrayed as an outstandingly beautiful woman, dressed in a macabre hat, veil and long black robes, with a wicked curved dagger held behind her back and a cruel smile on her perfect lips!

Other depictions are known; in the Allansian provinces of Chiang Mai and Kay Pong, Tanit is shown as a bejewelled, six-armed woman, each hand of whom bears a scimitar. Tanit is followed by some Hags and the Evil race known as Sirens, while her Priestesses wear black robes and veils, and her symbol is a curved dagger.

The Dagger of Tanit is in fact a powerful unholy item in its own right and sometimes gifted to the most devout follower of the Goddess in their time of greatest need (see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p150). Holy days of Tanit include the 31st of Fire and the 13th of Locking.
