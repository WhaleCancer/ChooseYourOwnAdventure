Téla Oriens, the White Lord, is a legendary [Elf](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md) spellcaster who studied under both [Hamaskis](Hamaskis.md), as Livurien the Sorcerer, and [Alliarien](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#alliarien) the God of Elven Magic, and mastered the magical arts of both Wizardry and Sorcery to become the first Archmage.

He is the brother of the tragic prince Aëlf Oriens and independently established the Ritual structure of Arcane Magic. Téla Oriens is probably the second most important Elven God after Erillia (i.e. [Galana](Galana.md)), with whom he communed at the heart of the One Forest during the Godtime, to learn the mysteries of magic and Ritual.

He appears as a tall, regal High Elf, in white robes, with a scroll in one hand and a quill in the other. Téla Oriens is worshipped by all Elves, but especially those who are sages, students, scholars and students of magic. The chosen colour of the White Lord, is, perhaps unsurprisingly, white, and his symbol is a quill used for writing.
