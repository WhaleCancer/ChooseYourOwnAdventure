## God of Pride

**Specific Power:** Fourga's Pride

When the Priest invokes the name of Fourga, one target within sight becomes inordinately proud of one of their abilities, actually increasing that ability. The highest value Special Skill the target possesses is temporarily boosted by a +2 bonus. If this power could apply to several of the target's Special Skills, the target gets to choose which one is boosted. The effects will last for a number of minutes equal to the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Bravery
- Heal

The son of [Usrel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#usrel) and the brother and husband of [Courga](Courga.md) and the father of [Telak](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#telak), Fourga is not a well regarded God.

Pride is no longer considered a virtue by most cultures, and so his name is usually invoked in a negative fashion: "You are as proud as Fourga" is considered something of an insult. Other names for Fourga include Vinar (in Ruddlestone), Dyshyos, and Pirin.

His Priests wear red robes, and his symbol is a hunting dog, that often accompanies Fourga in his depiction as a warrior. Several major holy items are associated with Fourga, including the Golden Fist, a relic stored at his Temple in the town of Hasrah, and the great shield of Fourga's Favoured, rumoured to be kept by the King of Salamonis.
