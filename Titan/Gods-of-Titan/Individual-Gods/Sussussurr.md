**Prince of Snakes**

**Specific Power:** Strength of the Serpent

This power imbues the Priest or one touched target with the strength of a Serpent for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score. During this time, this will add an additional +2 to the Strength Special Skill of the target and also to Damage Rolls made in hand-to-hand combat whilst the power is active.

The Priest may also use this power to grapple with an opponent and restrain them. This power will bind the target object or creature in an unbreakable hold. Once bound, the target cannot move a muscle although they can still breathe. Only one target can be restrained in this manner at a time when this power is used.

**General Powers:**

- Banish
- Incite
- Shape Change

Sussussurr is the Son of [Vermistra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#vermistra) the Snake Goddess (who gives her name to the third year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan; known as the Year of the Snake), and boon companion to the [Demon Prince](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#demon-princes) [Sith](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sith).

Worshipped by the Caarth and their client-races, as an embodiment of strength and power, Sussussurr takes the form of an enormous python; a truly awesome beast, over twenty metres long and a metre thick. The holy symbol of Sussussurr is a coiled python and his sacred colour is light brown.
