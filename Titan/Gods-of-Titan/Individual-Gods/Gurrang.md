Gurrang is the God of bears and fought on the side of Good during the First Battle. His appearance differs depending on where he is worshipped, variously being depicted as an enormous polar bear or grizzly bear, with great talons and long fangs. Some say long ago he wandered the wilds of Irritaria during the Godtime, and scraps of his magical fur can still be found upon Titan today.

Indeed, explorers in the northern mountains of Allansia report finding caves with ancient paintings on the walls showing a vast Bear surrounded by the tiny figures of humans, although scholars agree that these could not have been painted from observed experience.

Gurrang is worshipped by outland Barbarian tribes, Allansian Northmen, including those from Frostholm, and Werebears. His symbol is that of a bear, and his holy colour is either white, black, or brown, depending on the resident bear population in his followers' immediate location.

Some followers carry an ivory bear charm for good luck. The Hour of the Bear is considered sacred for Gurrang.
