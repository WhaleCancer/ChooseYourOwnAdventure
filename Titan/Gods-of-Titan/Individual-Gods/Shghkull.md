## Sacred Father of the Caarth

**Specific Power:** Venom of the Cobra

This power will immediately enervate the Priest's weapons with a glowing green type of snake poison, which will inflict an additional point of STAMINA damage against an opponent, after each successful hit, for one combat only.

Alternatively, it can also create a powerful poison from any small amount of liquid or edible item. The poison is fast acting and immediately delivers STAMINA damage equal to 2 plus the Priest's Devotion score to whoever consumes the poison. A Priest with a Devotion score of 8 would thus create a poison that causes 10 STAMINA points of damage.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Bravery
- Smite versus non-reptiles

S'hghkull is the Father of the Caarth, the cobra-headed Demigod of war and battle, created by the Demon Lord [Sith](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sith) to watch over the stone citadels of the Caarth and encourage their expansion through conflict and strife.

S'hghkull is the husband of [H'ssghkull](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hssghkull), and although larger than his spouse (usually at three metres tall), and with four arms instead of two, he is much more stupid, with li0le in the way of human intelligence.

He has a martial Priesthood of warrior-monks within Caarth ranks, who are famed for their skills in combat and battle.

The symbol of S'hghkull is a cobra, and his sacred colour is light green.
