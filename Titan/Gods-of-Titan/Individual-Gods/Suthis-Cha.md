Suthis Cha is the ravenous God of lizards, immortalised for all time by his disastrous a0empt to swallow the Mouse God [Kareep](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kareep). He was the original creator of the race of Lizard Men (who were then converted into demon-worshippers by the [Demon Prince](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#demon-princes) [Ishtra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ishtra)) and is also venerated by other reptilian races such as Calacorms and Chameleonites.

Suthis Cha is also the Patron God of various isolated tribes in tropical areas. Lizards are sometimes a source of food for these tribes, play a role in controlling pests and the larger ones can be a physical threat to the people and their livestock. There are even rumours of especially isolated islands that have developed a form of agriculture that revolves around Lizard Farming!

He is also brother to [Vermistra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#vermistra) and [Furlakk](Furlakk.md). Suthis Cha appears as a gigantic lizard with a horned head, spiked back and a large mouth full of sharp teeth. His Priests wear dyed-green robes of lizard skin and his symbol is a gecko.
