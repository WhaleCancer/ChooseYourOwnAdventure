Achilla the Hunter is a Demigod known to take both male and female forms – Amazons, for example, worship her as a woman – and, as the latter, sometimes confused with Lama the Lithe, a legendary female human hunter of the Godtime and cursed mother of all Lamias. Regardless of gender, they appear as a human clad in leather armour and armed with a longbow. In Allansia they are known as Chlorissian, while in Khul they are called Elspar.

One of the greatest shrines to Achilla can be found upon the shores of Lake Libra in Analand; it is a holy location for pilgrims across the Old World. The constellation bearing the name of the Hunter can also be seen in the northern skies of Titan because of their courage during the First Battle. The sacred symbol of Achilla is a bow, and their revered colour depends on the terrain of their worshippers; for polar hunters it is white, for those in forests or jungles it is green, for hills and mountains the colour is grey, for swamps it is brown, and for deserts and plains the colour is yellow. Because of Achilla's standing, the final year in the eight-year cycle that reckons time in the remote Khulian kingdom of Hachiman, is known as the Year of the Arrow.
