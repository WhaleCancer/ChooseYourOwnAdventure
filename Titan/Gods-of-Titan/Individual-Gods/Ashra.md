## The God of Light

**Specific Power:** This Blinding Light

The Priest can cause a bright white blinding light to flood the area within a 5 metre radius. All Demons within this area will suffer a -2 penalty to their SKILL and will lose 1 STAMINA per Attack Round. The light will of course also illuminate the area as a Light spell and will last for a number of Attack Rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion.

**General Powers:**

- Banish
- Sanctuary
- Ward

Ashra is the God of Light, the Blinding Beam of Goodness that monitors the world and casts [Elim](Elim.md) and their darkness back into the far corners of existence. Along with Elim and [Vuh](Vuh.md), they were one of the primal deities, that flourished after [Arn](Arn.md) the First God and before the reign of [Titan](Titan.md) and his pantheon of younger Gods. As such, the worship of Ashra has largely faded from the more populous regions of Titan who pay tribute to later deities.

However, there are still some worshippers such as the Swamp Warriors of Ekaad, whose High Priest Zune bears a holy artefact of the God, called the Staff of Ashra, and the obscure Order of Arzochollies, dedicating to fighting Evil in all its guises and forms.

Ashra manifests as a towering pillar of gleaming light and their holy symbol is a shining star, while their sacred colour is white. The Hour of the Stars is considered sacred for Ashra.
