## Sacred Mother of the Caarth

**Specific Power:** Cradle of the Egg

When this power is used by the Priest, a touched target, whether an object or being, will grow half as big again almost immediately. Thus, a two metre tall man would grow to three metres in height! If a living creature, the target will benefit from the effects of a Strength spell due to its increased size, and clothing and armour will grow to match their wearer. This power lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Cure Poison and Disease
- Heal
- Protection versus non-Reptiles

H'ssghkull is the Mother of the Caarth, the viper-headed female human-bodied Demigoddess of fertility and egg-nurturing, spawned by the Snake Demon [Sith](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#sith) to watch over the stone citadels of her Caarth worshippers, and expedite their proliferation. H'ssghkull is the wife of [S'hghkull](Shghkull.md), and although smaller than her spouse and with only two arms instead of four, she is much cleverer, with both the natural cunning of a snake and the reasoning powers of a human.

She has a dedicated sisterhood of Priestesses within Caarth ranks, who are famed for their skills in both healing and protecting life, but warping it also, through the use of poison and mutations.

The symbol of H'ssghkull is a viper's head, jaws agape, and her sacred colour is yellow.
