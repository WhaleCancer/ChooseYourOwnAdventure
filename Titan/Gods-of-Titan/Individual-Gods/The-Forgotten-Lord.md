**God of the Final Bell**

**Specific Power:** For Whom The Bell Tolls

When the Priest uses this power, a sonorous bell tolls out across the landscape, reminding all present of their own fragile mortality. Anyone opposed to the Priest suffer a -1 penalty to all their dice rolls. The effect lasts for as many A0ack Rounds as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Commune
- Ward

The Forgo0en Lord is just that, an unremembered God from a dark corner of Titan's past, whose current worship depends on dire and precarious circumstances.

The worship of the Forgo0en Lord is still remembered in the mystic underworld beneath the ruined [Dwarf](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) fortress of Haelsgarth, in the depths of the Moonstone Hills. Here an aged Priest, descended from a long line of elderly Priests, waits in the darkness for the sign to toll the warning bell (of course, no sooner has the bell's leaden tolling faded, then the Priest's heart stops beating, and they die).

Some sages speculate that the Forgo0en Lord is the great lost God of the decrepit chaotic race known as Gnolls, though the Gnolls themselves discredit that association, and prefer to worship various newly ascendant [Demon Princes](The-Demon-Princes.md) instead! The holy symbol of the Forgo0en Lord is a bell, and his sacred colour is bronze.
