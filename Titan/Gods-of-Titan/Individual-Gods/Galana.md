**Goddess of Plants and Fertility**

**Specific Power:** Animate Plants

The Priest may cause all plants within 5 metres to become animated, hindering enemies of the Priest. The effect will vary with the amount of affected vegetation in the area, but will cause enemies within this area to suffer a penalty to any and all physical actions, including combat. Low grass may induce a penalty of -1 as the grass writhes and moves underfoot, while thick jungle undergrowth could cause a penalty as high as -3 or more. It lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Create Food and Water
- Cure Poison and Disease
- Heal

A daughter of [Titan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#titan), leader of the Gods and creator of the world, and [Glantanka](Glantanka.md) the sun Goddess, and the sister of [Throff](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#throff), Galana is the Patron of farmers and [Elves](../The-Forces-of-Good/Elves-The-Children-of-Galana.md), and one of the major Gods, although she is also known by various other names. Elves call her [Erillia the Elf Mother](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana) and make the sign of the Sacred Tree in her honour, and she is named elsewhere as Kachasta, Turgot, Zaran, the Gardener, and by [Orcs](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Orcs-The-Warriors-of-Evil.md) as the Lady of Corn.

In her form as the Veiled Sorceress from the First Battle, she has a constellation named after her in the southern skies of Titan. Because of Galana's standing, the first year in the eight-year cycle that reckons time in the remote Khulian kingdom of Hachiman, is known as the Year of the Tree. Deities associated with Galana include [Cholumbara](Cholumbara.md), and [Varantar](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#varantar), plus the Elf Gods; [Aëgraven](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#aëgraven), [Alliarien](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#alliarien), [Argowen](Argowen.md), [Euthillial](Euthillial.md), [Iatro](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#iatro), [Istarel](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#istarel), and [Ititia](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#ititia), who are known collectively as the Children of Erillia (though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than actual fact).

Galana is usually depicted as a beautiful Elven woman swathed in green robes and chains of flowers. Temples and Priests to Galana are common in rural areas, and both spring and autumn seasons see special Rituals to appease and placate her, in the hope of a good harvest. Her Priests wear green robes, and her symbol is a tree.

In the Allansian calendar, the month of Watching is sacred to Galana, while her Khulian influence extends to the months of both Land's Awakening and Man's Harvesting, as well as the season of Spring. Holy days of Galana include the 28th of Dark and the 13th of Reaping.
