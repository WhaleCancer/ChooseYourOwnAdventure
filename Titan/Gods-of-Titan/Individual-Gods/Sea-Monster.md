The Sea Monster fought alongside [Karkara](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#karkara) the Shark Goddess and the [Behemoth](Behemoth.md) for the forces of Evil during the First Battle and is also known as Lord of the Gaping Maw. Some say the Sea Monster now lives on the Elemental Plane of Water, engaged in an endless hunt against Lord Whale.

A Demigod of reptilian horrors such as Leviathans, Sea Hydras, Elverines, and Sea Serpents, the Sea Monster is rarely worshipped by others but does have some followers among the buccaneers of Tak and the Chaos Pirates of the Blood Islands, who revere him as the Great Seaworm "Clapnup".

In addition, the Sharadrin or Sea Trolls have followers of the Sea Monster, particularly among their warriors and soldiers. Because of the Sea Monster's standing, the constellation bearing his name can be seen in both the northern and southern skies of Titan. The holy symbol of the Sea Monster is a circular sea serpent swallowing its own tail, and his chosen colour is blue.
