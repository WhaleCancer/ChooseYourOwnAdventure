## Queen of Spiders

**Specific Power:** Web of Veracna

The use of this power by the Priest will fill an area up to 5 metres in diameter with strong, sticky spider webs. Anyone within the area will be bound by multiple strands and completely immobilised. A very strong victim such as a Troll or Giant can break out in two A0ack Rounds, and any Hero with the Strength Special Skill can break out after two successful Strength tests. Heroes without the Strength Special Skill must wait for the power's duration to elapse before they are freed; it lasts for as many rounds as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Cure Poison and Disease
- Curse
- Shape Change

Veracna is the Spider Queen, the consort of [Arhallogen](Arhallogen.md) the Spider God. Also known as Krya-Shebboth, she appears as a horrible, gigantic black hairy spider, whose huge bloated body is supported on eight bristly legs, clicking her mandibles and staring at her prey with cold black eyes. Like Arhallogen, Veracna is venerated by spider cultists and Spider Folk, and every spider Temple usually has a shrine to her as a guardian Deity of the web.

Perhaps one of her greatest followers was the Demon Spider, a human-headed, spider-bodied Priestess who lived within the original Dungeon of Despair, on the borders of the Kingdom of Karazan during Irritarian times. Because of both Arhallogen and Veracna's standing, the thirteenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Spider. The holy colour of Veracna is black, and her symbol is a spider's web.
