**The Root of Evil**

**Specific Power:** Animate Thorns

The Priest may cause all thorns and weeds within 5m to become animated hindering enemies of the Priest. The effect will vary with the number of plants in the affected area but will cause all enemies within this area to suffer a penalty to any and all physical actions, including combat. A weedy lawn of grass may induce a penalty of -1 as it grabs and squirms underfoot, while a barbed nightmarish undergrowth of thorns, brambles and briars could cause a penalty as high as -5. It lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Incite
- Weakness

The Darkthorn is the Root of Evil, the God of Corruption, stylised as the Lord of Weeds, Thorns, Brambles, Briars, and parasitic Epiphytes. They are the antithesis of [Galana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#galana) the Plant Goddess, not growing for life, but growing instead to strangle the life out of others.

The Darkthorn takes the appearance of tendrils and roots, covered in vicious thorns, forming the shape of a giant humanoid with emerald orbs for eyes. Their sacred colour is green and a tangle of intertwined brambles forms their holy symbol. Cults of the Darkthorn are outlawed in most Goodly areas, but there were recent accounts of an active coven within the kingdom of Ruddlestone, that had even infiltrated upwards into the nobility (although some adventurers suggested the flow of infection actually ran downwards the other way).
