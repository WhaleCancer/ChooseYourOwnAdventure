**God and Incarnation of Death**

**Specific Power:** Finger of Death

When the Priest uses this power, one single target within 10 metres who has less remaining STAMINA than the Priest's Devotion score, will drop dead. The target must Test for Luck twice, and it is for this reason that Priests of Death are widely feared. The target can be considered to be on -4 STAMINA immediately.

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Ill-Luck
- Smite versus All

Death is the prime [Dark Lord](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md) and was ultimately responsible for the First Battle and the imposition of Time on the world of Titan and the changing of the old order. His other names include the Closer, the Finisher, the Grim Reaper, and Krsh, the sound of a dying man's last breath. Death is one of the most powerful of the Evil Gods and has no worshippers in civilised lands.

His few Priests wear black robes and have a skull for their symbol and are feared by all they encounter. Known Priests of Death are ruthlessly hunted down in more civilised areas. Death is sometimes depicted as a robed skeleton wielding a scythe or a mighty, black-skinned Giant with an axe forged from the metal of the night. This black metal axe, also known as the Finisher (see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p147), has sometimes been gifted as a temporary unholy boon to Death's greatest follower on Titan, including Death Acolytes from cursed Bathoria. In Khul, the month of Land's Sleeping is holy to Death as well as Fearday in the Khulian week. Holy days of Death include the 4th of Winds.
