## God of Birds

**Specific Power:** Summon Giant Eagle

Once per day the Priest may summon a Giant Eagle (see Out of the Pit, p43-44) to aid them in any way possible by uttering the words "Hawklord, Guardian of Birds, preserve me!". The Giant Eagle can only be summoned if the Priest is above ground or there is a species of predatory bird nearby. The Giant Eagle will remain present for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score or until slain.

**General Powers:**

- Bravery
- Shape Change
- Smite versus followers of [Gargoyle](Gargoyle.md) and [Nyctule](Nyctule.md)

The Hawklord is a member of the Animal Court and the major Patron Deity of all the birds, including some of the more fantastical types such as the Roc. During the First Battle he fought alongside [Kilanirax](Kilanirax.md) against the vultures and bats of the Gargoyle and Nyctule. The God himself takes the form of a mighty bird of prey, whose feathers are a mix of glinting gold, jet black and rich deep brown.

The Hawklord is worshipped by all birds as their master and served by the Celastrix who act as messengers and guardians. Bird Men also follow the way of the Hawklord when not corrupted by the Powers of Chaos.

Because of the Hawklord's courage during the First Battle, the eleventh year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Eagle, and the constellation bearing his name can also be seen in the northern skies. The chosen colour of the Hawklord is gold and his sacred symbol is that of a feather. The Hour of the Eagle is considered holy for the Hawklord. Holy days of the Hawklord include the Festival of Eagles on the 27th of Winds.
