Harrun is the Cattle God, the lord of bulls and cows, and of oxen and buffaloes. He appears as a powerful bull, either shining white or glistening black depending on the regional affiliations of his Temple and is heavily associated with other agricultural deities including [Cholumbara](Cholumbara.md) and [Varantar](Varantar.md). Harrun is venerated by all cattle folk across Titan who deal with bovine livestock, from nomadic herders of the southern flatlands to dairy farmers of the cooler northern regions.

Many farms across Titan will have a tiny shrine to Harrun in their farmhouse or barn. This will likely be little more than an alcove with a candle or two and a skull from the best bull the farm has ever produced. It is hoped that the spirit of the bull will channel the attention of their God and make their herd more productive.

He is even held in some esteem by creatures including Minotaurs and Mooncalves. The sacred colour of Harrun is either black or white (and sometimes both) and his symbol is a bull. Because of Harrun's standing, the fourth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Ox.
