Strix is the Goddess of Owls and wisdom and appears as an enormous owl with completely white feathers and great glaring yellow eyes.

She is companion to the [Hawklord](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hawklord), [Libra](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#libra) and [Hamaskis](Hamaskis.md), and Giant Owls are known to pay homage to her.

There are no human Temples to Strix, but a few Elven villages have a small Shrine to this Goddess, making use of a large natural hole high in some great tree. There will usually be a Priest in a0endance, but few regular worshippers. However, Elven hunters will sometimes make a donation and offer prayers here to Strix before going on a hunt to ask for the stealth and vision of a hunting owl to aid them in their coming trials.

Because of her standing, the seventeenth year in the twenty-year Turn cycle that measures time on Titan is known as the Year of the Owl. The sacred colour of Strix is white and her symbol is an owl, usually rendered as a gold or brass trinket. The Hour of the Owl is considered holy for Strix.
