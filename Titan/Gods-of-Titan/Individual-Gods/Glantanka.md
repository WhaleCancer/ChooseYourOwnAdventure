**Sun Goddess**

**Specific Power:** Glantanka's Radiance

The Priest can cause the bright light of the sun to flood the area, within a 5-metre radius. All undead within this area will suffer a -2 penalty to their SKILL, and will lose 1 STAMINA point per A0ack Round. The light will of course also illuminate the area as a Light spell, and will last for a number of A0ack Rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Heal
- Sanctuary
- Smite versus Undead

Sister to [Filash](Filash.md) and [Lunara](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#lunara), wife of [Titan](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#titan), and mother of [Throff](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#throff) and [Galana](Galana.md), Glantanka the sun Goddess is worshipped across Titan; in cold lands her followers call for her to bring spring, and in hot regions her followers beg for protection. She is usually depicted as a silver or golden-skinned woman with glowing hair and eyes (which are without pupil or iris), and [Kilanirax](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#kilanirax) the Dragon King is her servant.

Glantanka has many names, including Mother of the World, Assamura, Brethin's Bane, Hazdur, Herel, Numara, Sevena, Ariella, the All-Consuming Blindness, and Quuosshreeggaa. Her Temples are often open-air, and flat-topped pyramids are a favoured design to bring the Priests closer to their Goddess.

One of the greater Gods, her Priests wear yellow robes and have a sun as their symbol. She is usually hated and feared by subterranean-dwelling races. One of her holiest relics, the Jewel of the Eternal Sun, is rumoured to be hidden within the Dungeon of the Dawn, a ruined Temple once dedicated to Glantanka that lies on the shores of the Sea of Pearls in eastern Allansia.
