Siluva is the God of great worms, which infest the world of Titan, and is honoured by those that share their territory with the mightiest of his children. Thus, depictions of Siluva vary from region to region; the nomadic sufi of the Desert of Skulls know him as a Giant Sandworm, while to the primitive swamp tribes he is a Mudgrinder or Giant Mudworm, and he appears to the northern barbarians as a Polar Worm or Chion.

Although there are a few Shrines to Siluva that take the classic "small building" form, some are rumoured to be carved out of the earth by various Giant Worms, with the Temple being the tunnels and chambers so created. Some of these Temples are said to stretch for miles under the desert or swamp, although no explorers have every seen these places.

Priests of Siluva are rare; those that do follow the Worm God wear white, yellow or pink robes, and the Deity's symbol is a worm swallowing its own tail in the shape of a circle.
