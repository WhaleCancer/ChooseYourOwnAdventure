Also a son of [Throff](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#throff) and [Hydana](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#hydana), Farigiss is the God of cold and ice, and is primarily worshipped in the far north of Allansia, such as at the Shrine of Farigiss in Frostholm, north of the city of Vynheim. He is also known as Old Man Winter as that season is dedicated to him, as are the Allansian month of Freeze, the Khulian month of Snow's Cloak, and Freezeday in Khul as well.

There is very li0le organised religion around Farigiss, mainly being conducted by the shamans of the northern nomads and barbarians, though his greatest champion on Titan is a mysterious armoured figure known only as the Winter King.

Farigiss takes the form of a pallid, blue-skinned man whose hair is frosted with icicles. The symbol of Farigiss is a snowflake and his colour is white. Holy days of Farigiss include the 21st of Freeze.
