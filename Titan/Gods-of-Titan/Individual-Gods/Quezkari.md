The Cult of Quezkari (who the Djaratians knew as M'yathud), is also known as the Cult of the Black Skull and dedicated to venerating the voodoo Deathgod.

It is active on many islands in the Western Ocean and beyond, including Bone Island, Skull Island and the Blood Islands. From here, worship has spread via secretive underground sects to coastal cities such as the Port of Crabs, Port Blacksand, and the City of Mazes.

Quezkari himself appears as a skeletal human body with an oversized grinning skull, whose jaws are lined with pointed teeth. His taloned hands hold blazing torches and he wears a headdress of crows' feathers. The most powerful High Priest of Quezkari in recent times was Ramatu, who ruled from a hidden jungle Temple on Bone Island. The sacred colour of Quezkari is black and his symbol is a black skull.
