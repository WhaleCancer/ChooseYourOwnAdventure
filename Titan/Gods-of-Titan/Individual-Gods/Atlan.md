Anyone so afflicted will have a +1 bonus to any Special Skill test (not A0ack Rolls) made during this time. This power lasts for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score.

Atlan is the Messenger of the Gods, the Sounder of the Final Horn, the Jack-in-the-Green, and the Herald of the Heavens. Due to this sonorous connection, bards and troubadours acknowledge him as the lord of music, dance and song, and he was named as Melodius the God of Music in ancient Vangoria (and is sometimes reputed to appear on Titan in the form of a gaudy Harlequin). It was the explosion of the volcano known as Atlan's Beacon that precipitated the destruction of [Atlantis](../The-Underwater-Kingdoms/Atlantis-the-Sunken-City.md), and some consider the Sirens his God-cursed offspring.

Atlan appears as a handsome male human in robes, with a laurel crown and a brass horn on a velvet rope (which, as the Final Horn, is sometimes gifted to ardent followers; see Encyclopedia Arcana: Volume 1, p146), and the constellation bearing his name as Sounder of the Final Horn can also be seen in the southern skies because of his courage. Atlan's sacred sign varies but is generally a three-stringed lyre or a trumpet or horn of some description, and his holy colour is gold.
