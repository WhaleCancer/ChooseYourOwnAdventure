## God of Travellers

**Specific Power:** Fulkra's Way

When used, this power will allow the Priest to instinctively know the safest path to one named destination. However, the knowledge will only cover one day's travel, so it must be re-used each day to be useful.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Heal
- Ward

Brother to [Solinthar](../Chapter-3-The-Gods-of-Titan.md#solinthar), Fulkra is the Patron of all those who spend their days travelling: merchants, pedlars and adventurers. Although the roads in some parts of Titan are relatively safe, those travelling in the less civilised areas or across longer distances face many possible dangers: monsters, storms, landslides, rivers and worse. Some of these can be overcome with a strong sword arm, skill at magic or a knowledge of survival techniques, but even if you have all of those things in abundance, the favour of the Gods is always a welcome extra.

Even those who are not faithful worshippers of Fulkra might wear a signpost amulet when travelling, because you never quite know how helpful it might be!

His Shrines and Chapels can be found at the gates to major cities, for travellers to leave an offering as they set off on their journey and are also at way-houses and crossroads.

His Priests wear grey travel-stained robes, and his symbol is a signpost. He has very few permanent Temples. Holy days of Fulkra include the 4th of Warming.
