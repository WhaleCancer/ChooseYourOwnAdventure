## God of Elven Magic

**Specific Power:** Gift of Magic

Once per day the Priest is gifted with the power of random magic. Roll three separate dice and see the Heroes Companion (p28) for the random spell that has been gifted. Rules on Chaos Magic (see Heroes Companion, p26-27) DO NOT apply for this spell's casting. The Director always has the power of veto over a random spell granted. If this Power is used a second time in a single day, the spell should be re-rolled on the subsequent use.

**General Powers:**

- Banish
- Commune
- Sanctuary

Alliarien is the God of Elven Magic in both its higher and lower forms, which, in practical terms, means human-derivatives such as Wizardry and Minor Magic ([Hamaskis](Hamaskis.md), in his Elven role as Livurien the Sorcerer, is the originator-God of Sorcery). Known as Aranath in Arantis and Tho-Aat the ibis-headed God of magic in ancient Djarat, Alliarien actually takes the form of a tall Elven wizard in long blue robes covered in silver stars.

Alliarien is one of the many Children of Erillia the Elf Mother (and known to humans as [Galana](Galana.md)), though this is thought to be a symbolic title rather than fact. The Spirit of Alliarien was one of three magical Vapours born to Queen Ethilesse of Sti0le Woad.

Alliarien is worshipped by all magic-using Elves. The holy colour of Alliarien is blue and silver, and their symbol is that of an equilateral triangle, point facing up.
