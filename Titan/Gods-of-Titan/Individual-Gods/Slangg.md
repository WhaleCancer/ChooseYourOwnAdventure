**God of Malice**

**Specific Power:** Hatred of Slangg

The Priests of Slangg are feared across Titan, especially by those groups of adventurers that cross their path. The Priest may cause one target within sight to hate one other being with a furious, burning hatred. This hatred will last for a number of A0ack Rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion score, but during this time the target will hate their victim enough to a0ack them immediately. The Director must rule on the exact details of the power.

**General Powers:**

- Curse
- Incite
- Smite versus Good races

Slangg, brother of [Tanit](Tanit.md), is not a widely worshipped God, being restricted primarily to the city of Kharé in Kakhabad (where unlucky people are said to suffer "the grace of Slangg"), and the underground cities of the Dark Elves (who know him as Ar Anwar Gerithan, the "Grey Whisperer of Shadows").

Slangg was formerly worshipped in ancient Djarat as Amweh. He is depicted as a grossly fat man with the forked tongue of a snake, typically posed whispering an aside behind his hand. Slangg is devoted to spreading fear, terror and pain as far abroad as possible; converts must repent their previous ways and follow the Teachings of Slangg, disseminated from the sacred book, Slangg's Deeds of Malice.

His Priests wear bright orange robes and have shaved heads, and always carry an array of weapons and torture tools. His symbol is a forked snake's tongue. The Staff of Hatred (see Demons of Doom, p57) is a noted unholy item sacred to Slangg and sometimes entrusted to the greatest of his holy men and women upon Titan.
