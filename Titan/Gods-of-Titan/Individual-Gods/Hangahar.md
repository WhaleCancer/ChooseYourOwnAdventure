## The Goldseeker

**Specific Power:** Detect Metal

When the Priest uses this power they instantly become aware of the presence of a large amount of metal. The power will provide the compass direction to the nearest largest amount of metal, whether that be an underground seam or an armoury full of weapons and armour. This power does not provide accurate directions nor distance, just pointing in the straightest direction regardless of what lies in between. This power when used will last for as many minutes as the Priest's Devotion score.

**General Powers:**

- Bless
- Commune
- Sanctuary

Hangahar Goldseeker is the discoverer and founder of what became the holy [Dwarf](../The-Forces-of-Good/Dwarfs-The-Delvers-of-the-Deep.md) city of Fangthane, deified after his passing to arise as a Patron Demigod of miners and prospectors, all who claim to follow "Hangahar's Way".

This God is typically depicted as a Dwarf mine-chief, with simple leather armour, a wooden shield and a pickaxe, a leather cap, and a nose painted gold.

He is worshipped by Dwarfs and Skorn, and sometimes other miners, and hated by all followers of [Dhaktili](Dhaktili.md) as a despoiler of the great underworld. The sacred colour of Hangahar is gold and his symbol is either a pickaxe or a nose.
