## Religion on Titan

The Gods of Titan once roamed the world but have since retreated to the heavens, leaving their Priests as agents to achieve their aims and recruit worshippers.

Religion on Titan varies widely, from animal deities with no formal religion to major gods with highly organized religions. Most gods have Priests, who can be hermits, wandering loners, crusading adventurers, or temple-bound. Heroes are noted as more likely to be wanderers than temple Priests.

Common people acknowledge all Gods but revere one above others, choosing their God based on family, community, or profession (e.g., a sailor worshipping the God of the sea). Priests, however, worship only one God.

Priests must act according to their religion and God's tenets. The Director (game master) and player should agree on expected and forbidden behaviors. Transgressions can lead to the God withdrawing the Priest's special powers, either temporarily or permanently.

## Temples

Larger, more organized religions base their worship around Temples. Cities may have vast stone edifices, while villages might have small wooden buildings or huts for Priests. Temples to nature Gods could be sacred groves or pools.

All consecrated Temples possess power and are difficult for supernatural enemies to enter. Some Temples may even be in caves or forest groves.

Ancient Temples, even to forgotten Gods, retain lingering power and should be approached with care.

The largest Temples are described as having multiple Priests, guards, support staff, accommodation, and other services, serving as sanctuaries for Heroes friendly to the God. Very large Temples can have significant investments and wield both secular and religious power, with the High Priest being a very important figure.

Heroes can find healing and other services at many Temples, though a donation is expected if they can afford it.

## Priests

Priests always carry a symbol of their religion, worn prominently unless in enemy territory. Priests of organized religions wear appropriate robes or costumes, proudly proclaiming their allegiance and profession through their symbol and attire.

Priestly Heroes are distinct from other adventurers due to their social advantages and responsibilities. Most Priests have a higher social rating, can request lodging at similarly aligned Temples or from other Priests, and command respect in many communities.

## Priestly Abilities

Each God grants followers abilities and powers to spread their word and defeat enemies. These powers resemble magical abilities, but unlike Wizards or Sorcerers who use incantations and gestures, Priests merely murmur a prayer to their God to invoke effects.

A Priest needs a "MAGIC" characteristic but doesn't test it to use an ability. The sum of a Priest's "MAGIC" characteristic and their "Magic-Priestly" special skill is called "Devotion," which determines the effect of their powers.

### Using Powers

A Priest's ability use "happens" when declared, and the only impediment is if their Gods' favour has been withdrawn.

Priests do not use magic points as their power is divine. They can use each gifted power once per day, becoming available again at midnight. In dire circumstances, a power can be used a second time by deducting a LUCK point, but never a third time. Priestly abilities cannot be avoided by LUCK tests unless specified.

### Holy Symbols

While Priests carry them as evidence of faith, they are not strictly required for power use. However, a Priest would not hide or lightly suffer the loss of their symbol, as it proclaims their identity.

### Powers Granted

Each God grants specific and three common powers, with common powers listed below and unique powers detailed later in the chapter.

## Salvation

"Salvation" is a once-per-career, last-chance call to a deity made while the Priest is alive (even if unconscious) to save them from their predicament. It can include companions and often manifests flashily. The Priest will not be fully healed, but all saved will be conscious. The final location of the Priest and companions is left ambiguous.

In very rare circumstances, a God might grant an additional Salvation to a Priest, or even offer it to a non-Priest, typically only after a truly epic quest.

## Common Power Descriptions

The extent of many power effects is based on the Priest's "Devotion," which is the sum of their MAGIC Characteristic and Magic-Priestly special skill.

Both common and unique powers can be personalized for different Gods; for example, a Priest of [Filash](Individual-Gods/Filash.md) (God of Fire) using "Smite" would cause their weapon to burst into flames.

### Heal

An almost ubiquitous and useful power. The Priest must touch one target and recite a prayer, granting STAMINA points equal to the Priest's Devotion. STAMINA cannot exceed initial value, and excess points are wasted. It does not cure poison or disease but cures STAMINA loss from such afflictions.

A character can normally only benefit from one "Heal" per day. A second "Heal" on the same day requires sacrificing a LUCK point, as "Gods require a sacrifice from those who demand too much."

### Protection

"Protection" shields the Priest and colleagues from a specific enemy type with "shimmering magical armour." The specific enemies are listed per God.

The power can protect as many allies as the Priest has Devotion (the Priest counts as one). It increases apparent armour as described in the table below, works against physical and magical attacks, and lasts for an entire combat.

**Protection Armour Enhancement Table:**

| Current Armour | Resulting Effective Armour |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| None | Leather Hauberk |
| Leather Cuirass | Chain Cuirass |
| Leather Hauberk | Chain Hauberk |
| Chain Cuirass | Breastplate |
| Chain Hauberk | Plate Armour with +1 to the roll |
| Breastplate | Plate Armour with +2 to the roll |
| Plate Armour | Plate Armour with +3 to the roll |

### Cure Poison/Disease

Completely cures poison or diseases in one touched target, and can also cure parasites or infestations.

### Create Food and Water

Creates plain but nourishing food (bread, fruit, cooked vegetables) and clean water. The quantity depends on the Priest's Devotion, and it lasts for 12 hours.

### Smite

Allows the Priest to deal greatly increased damage against enemies of their God. It lasts for a number of combat rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion and allows rolling 2 separate D6s for damage, with bonuses applied to both rolls.

### Bless

Imbues one target with a bonus of +1 to all dice rolls for a number of combat rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion. This bonus applies to combat rolls, spellcasting tests, SKILL tests, damage rolls, armour rolls, and LUCK tests.

### Bravery

Makes all allies within a certain radius (equal to the Priest's Devotion) immune to all fear, including poor morale, magical fear, and creature-induced fear, for the entirety of one combat.

### Ill-Luck

Causes one target to suffer a -1 penalty to all rolls and tests for a number of combat rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion. It cannot be avoided by LUCK and can be canceled by a Bless power.

### Ward

Creates a protected zone of 3m radius, preventing most undead, evil spirits, and demons from entering. Beings wishing to enter or affect those within must make an opposed roll (SKILL vs. Priest's Devotion +3). If the evil being wins, it can enter freely.

### Banish

Banshes a single undead, evil spirit, or demon. Both the Priest and the evil being make an opposed test (Priest uses Devotion +3 vs. evil being's SKILL). If the Priest wins, the being flees until sunset. If the evil being wins, the Priest has no further power over it that day.

### Weakness

Allows the Priest to drain an enemy's strength, agility, and motivation. It imposes negative modifiers on an enemy's SKILL, Damage rolls, and Armour rolls, with the total modifier value equal to the Priest's Devotion. An example is provided where a Priest with 7 Devotion applies -3 to SKILL, -2 to damage rolls, and -2 to armour rolls. SKILL, damage, and armour rolls cannot be reduced below 1, and these modifiers last for a number of combat rounds equal to the Priest's Devotion.

### Commune

Enables the Priest to directly communicate with their God. To use it, the Priest addresses a question to their deity and then either sleeps or meditates. The God provides information or guidance, which may be cryptic or obtuse, requiring the Director to interpret how much information is given.

### Curse

An "evil power" that allows the Priest to call down a divine curse on one target within 5 meters. The Priest must loudly declare the curse, and the target loses temporary STAMINA points equal to the Priest's Devotion. These points cannot be healed or restored until the curse is lifted by the caster, the cursing Priest is killed, or the victim is blessed by a High Priest with a Devotion at least 3 points higher than the cursing Priest.

### Shape Change

A power favored by Animal Gods, this allows the Priest to transform into an animal or creature appropriate to their deity once per day, and then back again. All clothes and equipment are included in the change, which takes a full round. The Priest retains full intelligence. If the creature's normal SKILL is higher than the Priest's, the Priest gains a +1 bonus to their SKILL while transformed, but retains their own STAMINA. The Priest also gains any special non-magical abilities of the creature, such as flight, extra attacks, or armoured hide.

### Sanctuary

Protects the Priest and a stationary area 2 meters around them from normal environmental threats like rain, snow, blazing sun, hot/cold weather, and biting insects. It explicitly states it does not protect from spells, powers, or creatures, but provides relative comfort for a number of hours equal to the Priest's Devotion.

### Incite

Causes one target within sight to lose their temper and become violent. While they remain broadly in control, they enter a "towering rage." Unlike other Priestly powers, this one allows the target a LUCK test to avoid the effect. The Director provides guidance, and the affected victim will not necessarily attack friends but will try to pick a fight with someone.

## Play Tips

Priests are invaluable members of an adventuring party, offering bonuses in combat, special protection, social abilities, and healing. The chosen God significantly impacts the Priest's career, cannot be changed, and new powers are not learned, making the initial decision crucial. Priests are capable fighters and are also very useful in civilization due to the respect they typically command.
