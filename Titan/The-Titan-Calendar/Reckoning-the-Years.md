## Overview

During the Time of Naming, when everything was given the title it would carry until the end of time, the years were allotted names in honour of the greatest of the beasts that walked the surface of Titan. The years still pass in twenty-year cycles in honour of the creatures whose names they bear.

## The Twenty-Year Cycle

The cycle of years is as follows:

1. The Year of the Dragon
2. The Year of the Lion
3. The Year of the Snake
4. The Year of the Ox
5. The Year of the Tiger
6. The Year of the Goat
7. The Year of the Mouse
8. The Year of the Deer
9. The Year of the Bat
10. The Year of the Wolf
11. The Year of the Eagle
12. The Year of the Dog
13. The Year of the Spider
14. The Year of the Rabbit
15. The Year of the Fox
16. The Year of the Crocodile
17. The Year of the Owl
18. The Year of the Cat
19. The Year of the Shark
20. The Year of the Horse

## Astrology and Birth Years

Some astrologers in Allansia and elsewhere believe that people born in a particular animal's year take on the characteristics of that animal. People born under the sign of the Owl, for example, are said to be wise and noble, but with a hidden savagery; those born in the Year of the Deer are said to grow up shy and nervous, always fleeing from the least danger. Whether or not it is true, many people give great honour to the animal of their birth-year on their twentieth birthdays, when they come of age and become recognized adults.

## Turns and After Chaos Reckoning

Each passing of the twenty-year cycle is called a 'Turn', so an old man may talk of being born in the Year of the Spider, three Turns ago. Of course, as you already know, the more civilized cultures also talk in terms of real dates, according to the system standardized by the scholars of the various seats of learning of the known world after the War of the Wizards, and instituted the After Chaos reckoning, of which we are now in the 284th year, the Year of the Fox. Thus, if he were a little more educated, and were proficient enough at the generally unknown discipline of mathematics, our elderly gentleman may tell us that he was born in 222 A C, and that he is a venerable sixty-two years old.

## Regional Variations

In other lands, they use very different systems for reckoning the years (though in some lands, such as Frostholm in the frozen north-east of Allansia, the people have no calendar at all, for they neither know nor care about their birth-dates or the time of the year!). Many people simply date their lives after noteworthy events, such as 'four years after the Battle for Vymorna Pass' or 'seventeen years after Hurlinn beheaded King Shakash of Kaynlesh-Ma'. The calendar of the semi-human nomads of the Baddu-Bak Plains in Kakhabad is based on years being a certain number 'Away' from the present; in other words, last year is One Away, and our old man was born in Sixty-two Away. The people of Hachiman in remote Khul reckon years by a cycle of eight named years (the Tree, the Fish, the Stone, the Sun, the First Moon, the Second Moon, the Sword and the Arrow) and also by the year of the reign of their ruler. Thus our old man might tell us that he was born in the Year of the Fish in the fourth year of Shogun Aykira (the grandfather, incidentally, of the current Shogun, Kihei Hasekawa).

## Conclusion

Understanding how years are reckoned is essential for anyone who wishes to travel or do business across the lands of Titan. While the standard twenty-year cycle and After Chaos reckoning provide a common framework for most civilized nations, the wise traveller will always be aware of local variations and will respect the customs and traditions of the people they encounter.
