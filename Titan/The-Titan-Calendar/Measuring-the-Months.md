## Overview

In the so-called civilized countries, which are stretched out along the narrow coastal strips as if trapped between the impassable ocean and the hostile interior, most people make a living from the land. Their entire lives revolve around the seasons of the year, for thus the farmers know when to plant their crops to reap the most fruit. In the small towns too, the citizens live strictly by the calendar, whether they are waiting for the regular visits of the travelling merchants, trying to remember when each type of fish can be found off the coast, or observing the feast-days of their gods. In any land visited by the caravans of the merchants, you will find that they reckon the passing of time in much the same way as anywhere else, but in wilder lands you may discover entirely different systems. Wherever you travel, however, you must respect the culture of the people, and try not to give offence – or you will soon find that their smiling hospitality hides glinting daggers grasped tightly behind their backs!

## The Standard Calendar

The standard calendar used throughout most of the civilized lands of Titan divides the year into twelve months, each with its own name and significance. These months are based on the natural cycles of the seasons and the movements of the celestial bodies, and are essential for farmers, merchants, and all those who need to coordinate their activities with others across the known world.

## The Twelve Months

The year is divided into twelve months, each approximately thirty days in length, though the exact number of days can vary slightly depending on the region and the specific calendar system in use. The months are named after natural phenomena, seasonal changes, and important events in the agricultural and religious cycles of the year.

Each month has its own character and significance, with particular festivals, agricultural activities, and religious observances associated with it. Farmers use the calendar to know when to plant and harvest their crops, while merchants rely on it to coordinate their trading schedules and ensure they arrive at markets at the right times.

## Regional Variations

While the standard twelve-month calendar is used in most civilized lands, there are many regional variations and alternative systems. In some wilder lands, the people may use entirely different methods of measuring time, based on local traditions, natural phenomena, or the movements of particular stars or constellations.

Some cultures divide the year into fewer or more months, while others use entirely different systems based on lunar cycles, seasonal changes, or other natural phenomena. It is important for travellers to be aware of these differences and to respect the local customs and traditions when visiting different lands.

## Conclusion

Understanding how the months are measured is essential for anyone who wishes to travel or do business across the lands of Titan. While the standard calendar provides a common framework for most civilized nations, the wise traveller will always be aware of local variations and will respect the customs and traditions of the people they encounter.
