spread quickly across the rolling land as far as the Brackish
Bay beyond the Onyx Sea. And beyond Brice, the tiny
kingdom of Ruddlestone was slowly rising in power under
the leadership of their priest-king. Emissaries arrived in Royal
Lendle from a place beyond the southern peaks, which called
itself Femphrey, and they revealed that the southern lands
were slowly being settled too.
In the space of perhaps a hundred years, the continent became
covered with many small nations. Regular trade-routes linked
the major towns, which slowly turned into cities. Caravans
crossed the continent, from Royal Lendle in the north as far
as Arkleton, the new capital of the nation which now called
itself Analand. True, the way was still fraught with danger,
especially when passing the Demon-haunted heights of the
Witchtooth Line and hastily crossing the eastern parts of
Lendleland, where horse-nomads and primitives still hunted
each other, but as trade became ever more important the
routes attracted other settlers, who began to civilize many
more areas. But with trade there always comes war, it seems,
for soon Gallantaria found itself drawn into conflict with
Brice, which wished to expand its borders to take advantage
of the better farming-land further west. Many battles were
fought during the reign of Regulus's great-greatgrandson,
King Werkel, until a truce was finally agreed, which made
the newly renamed Border River the new boundary of the
lands.
Having had its taste of battle, however, Brice wanted more,
and looked eastwards towards Ruddlestone. The people of
the small nation were very religious, ruled by a priest-king
who they fully believed to be the divine representative of their
gods on the Earthly Plane. Spurred into action by forays into
their land by soldiers from Brice, the good people of
Ruddlestone built their massive Demonkeep Fortress, and
filled it with a garrison of fanatical warriors, who have kept
an unsleeping eye on Brice ever since. In response, Brice
turned into an increasingly warlike state too, with things
coming to a head in the First and Second Ruddlestone Wars
of 1735 and 1805.
ANALAND AND ITS WALL
While the lands of the north were fighting among themselves,
the southern province of Analand was slowly becoming more
and more civilized under the influence of several hundred
years of benevolent rule by the Arkle Dynasty. The kings of
Analand became known for their careful, considerate rule,
which turned Analand from just another collection of small
trading towns into a civilized centre for trade and learning.
But outsiders looked at Analand with envy and greed. Surely,
ran the thoughts of every two-bit sorcerer and brigand in the
southlands, if the land is so peaceful and contented, it must
be wealthy beyond compare.
So, from all sides, Analand was suddenly assailed by raiders,
who burnt villages, desecrated temples, and put whole areas
to the sword. The whole tone of Analand changed, as warriors
became more commonplace than farmers or traders on the
roads leading north and west. Relations with Lendleland,
whose citizens many of the raiders ostensibly were, became
strained almost to the point of war, which was averted only
after careful diplomacy on both sides. After forty years of
incessant raids, King Arkle XIX could take it no longer. With
his team of advisers, he drew up a plan which would help
protect Analand from all opportunistic brigands and
mercenaries. His plan was simple – build a wall around the
land and the raiders would not be able to get in!
In 1845 OT, the building of the Great Wall of Analand was
begun. It was an immense project, planned to take a hundred
and twenty years, but it suffered immediate setbacks when
the first section was torn down stone by stone by a massive
force of raiders. The Analanders drove them back, but they
returned again and again, hindering the work with carefully
planned attacks. The deadline for the wall came and went,
with only half of its length completed and the land near to
bankruptcy and revolution as all resources were poured into
keeping the wall going. Finally, in the year 1970 OT, work on
the Great Wall of Analand was stopped for good. It was
incomplete in three places, and in many other places it was
already crumbling as a result of the repeated poundings of
raiders from Lendleland, but to be fair it did protect Analand
in many places, and it is often awesomely impressive.
Now that the Great Wall was officially 'finished', Analand
could concentrate on rebuilding its trade and economy, and
continue its path towards civilization. Across the whole of
the Old World, the nations were settling down. Disputes were
still too frequent, but by now they had fallen into a routine
of threat, counter-threat, border skirmish, diplomatic protest,
major battle, and then peace. Brice still squabbled with
anyone it could; raiders still used Lendleland as a base for
attacks on isolated parts of Far Analand; pirates began to prey
on merchants rounding the northern capes, but they had little
effect on the volume of trade; dark things still lurked in the
highlands and the vermin-pit of Kakhabad, and made
occasional forays into the lowlands, only to be driven back
again. Everything carried on much as normal.
HISTORY AND LEGEND     37


The Spawning of Chaos
While Allansia and the Old World were slowly pulling
themselves towards civilization, in the far land of Khul
stranger things were beginning, things which would
eventually affect all of Titan. At first, however, the growth of
this continent was very similar to that of the other two.
Khul was originally a very fertile land, with a semicircular
arc of gently rolling steppes enclosing a wide central area of
flat moorland and grassy plain, cut by wide, slow-moving
rivers. The early people of this land were mostly uncivilized
hunters and foragers, experts at tracking and killing game,
but not so good at writing or counting. In the western lands,
however, game became scarce and people took to living off
the land. Eventually a few villages began forming along the
coast, and then further inland. Around 1510 OT, a number of
small towns along the west coast were unified under the rule
of King Klarash Silverhair, and the nation of Klarash was
formed.   Under  his  rule, the nation slowly grew, until by
the year 1565 it stretched from the southern edge of Scorpion
Swamp (then, as now, a perilous place of danger and
adventure) to the River Swordflow. Incidentally, the latter
received its name in 1542, when the first exploratory party of
warriors from Klarash came under attack from a horde of
diminutive Goblins while attempting to ford it. Up to their
chests in water, the warriors attempted to draw their
weapons, but were swept off balance and rushed away by the
current to their deaths.
As Klarash grew in size and stature, it began sending its
merchants further and further afield. They travelled across
the central plains to small settlements like Remara, Varese
and Kabesh, and south to the small fishing villages on the
edge of the Inland Sea, and eventually even further afield,
rounding the Mountains of the Giants and heading north to
Ashkyos. Soon merchants were travelling back and forth so
frequently that small settlements grew up at intervals along
the route, eventually turning into towns themselves.
Klarash grew rich and powerful, and in the reign of
Silverhair's grandson, Klarash III, work was started on a new
capital, Shakista, in the centre of the kingdom, on the banks
of the Kasbled River (now known as the Catsblood). The
kingdom was expanded further north, as far as the small port
of Djiretta on the Coast of Sharks, but to the south the way
was blocked by tribes of primitives and Goblins, who fought
tooth and claw to remain on their lands. Eventually, however,
the armies of Klarash pushed them back. To keep them from
returning, the city of Zagoula was founded in 1611 OT.
Designed by the best stonemasons and architects the king
could find, it was a very beautiful place, a haven for scholars,
artists and sorcerers, who felt they could fully get to grips
with their subjects in such a stunning city.
Kabesh grew too, expanding into and around the rocky
outcrop against which it had been built. Under the rule of
Khan Gyorgir, a descendant of the legendary horse-nomad
chief who once swept across the central plains driving all
before him, it expanded until Kabesh was the capital city of
an empire which stretched from Kalagar in the north to Tak
in the south. His was a benevolent rule, though perhaps a
little too tolerant, for he did not mind who dwelt within his
lands, as long as they declared allegiance to him. On the
fringes of the Mountains of the Giants there dwelt a great
many Orcs and Goblins, but the Khan allowed them to reside
there in peace once they had sworn loyalty to his throne. As
soon as the Khan's representatives had left their lands, of
course, the Orcs went back to raiding the local villages,
slaughtering and murdering their inhabitants as if nothing
had changed.
In the far eastern corner of the continent, the cityport of Arion
grew up, supposedly on the ruins of a much older settlement
from before the dividing of the continents. It thrived on trade
with Ashkyos and Kabesh, and rapidly grew in stature until
it was almost the match of the Khan's capital itself. And
around the coast of the Inland Sea, a great number of trading
settlements grew until they were small walled city-states
themselves. Competition for trade between the cities of the
Inland Sea was fierce, resulting in sporadic wars – usually
settled by naval battles – as several city-states allied against
the others to try to enforce their own sets of tariffs and trading
terms.
In Klarash, the Shakista Dynasty built the King's Highway
from Djiretta – via the capital – to Kelther to unify the
kingdom, and the volume of trade crossing the kingdom
increased even further. Merchants and adventurers travelled
all the way from the Shantak River in the north to far Zagoula,
