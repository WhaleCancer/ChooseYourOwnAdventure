the city of knowledge. It was a peaceful land, its tranquillity
maintained by swift and decisive action from the soldiers of
the king at the first sign of any trouble!
THE DEAD CITY'S PRISONER
Such a long-lasting peace was far too good to last, of course,
though this time the danger which threatened was all-
encompassing. The sorcerers and sages of the city of Zagoula
were curious, as all scholars are, and they began travelling
about the world, seeking out new knowledge wherever they
could find it. From their magnificent city they wandered
north, studying the Goblin tribes who dwelt alongside the
stagnant Lake Mlubz. They journeyed south, taking in the
small southern garrisons of Yaziel and Hyennish, which by
now marked the southernmost extent of Klarash. Travelling
further afield, they discovered on the fringes of the Scythera
Desert the old leper colony, which was now Shakuru, the
revolting City of Beggars. They even braved the seemingly
endless expanses of the desert itself, running foul of Lizard
Men and shaggy Goblins.
And eventually, as if it had been pulling them towards it all
along, they found the river and the Dead City. A party of five
adventuring sorcerers and warriors chanced upon the river,
which seemed not to be flowing anywhere at all; it was just
there, its surface black with foul weed and giant insects. They
named it the River of Decay, and followed it eastwards. After
three days they came to the city, lying abandoned in the sand.
How long it had been there none could guess, but it must
have been very, very old, for its buildings were strangely
shaped – pyramids and diamonds seemed to dictate their
forms, rather than curves and squares – and much of it
seemed to be very inaccessible to beings shorter than about
three metres tall. Everything was decorated with images of
fish and octopi – bizarre and disturbing images to find in a
desert city. Nothing lived in the city – no monkeys, birds or
plants of any kind – and a strange atmosphere hung over the
whole place, so that the adventurers almost felt that they were
desecrating a holy shrine.
Exploring further, the adventurers came to the largest
building of all, an immense cathedral-like structure. When
they entered, they were plunged into darkness, for it had no
windows. Someone found a tinder-box, and as the flickering
flames danced from their candles, they gazed around and
caught their breath in wonder and shock! Everywhere was
decorated with statues and murals of writhing, tentacled
creatures, which were devouring humans and other creatures,
but all drew the viewers' attention towards the large dark
shape at the far end of the building. Their fluttering hearts
heaving inside their chests, the adventurers stepped forward.
When they approached, they could see it was a tomb, and a
large one at that. The atmosphere in the building was hot and
oppressive; voices seemed to dance in their heads, saying over
and over again, 'Open the tomb, open the tomb!' Almost as if
they were being forced against their wills, their hands
stretched out, and pushed at the stone slab covering the
sarcophagus.
Slowly, so slowly, it slid back, until it fell off the back with a
deafening crash that echoed around the building, and seemed
to bring the adventurers to their senses. They gazed around
in bewilderment, until the scaly hand inching its way over
the edge of the crypt caught their eyes. They stared transfixed,
rooted to the spot as the nightmarish creature sat up in its
coffin, its tentacles writhing as if sniffing the air. Somehow,
one of the adventurers tore his eyes away and screamed! His
fellows started, turned and fled the mausoleum and the city.
Many months later, one of the adventurers was found by a
merchant travelling from Zagoula to Yaziel. Half-dead from
exhaustion and dehydration, he babbled out his story. He had
survived the crossing of the Scythera Desert by killing and
eating his weaker colleagues, but now his strength failed him
and he died. The story of the Dead City and of its solitary
inhabitant spread like wildfire. Closely following it across
Klarash, however, were reports that Goblins and Orcs in the
Mountains of the Giants had abandoned any pretence of
peace, and were preparing for war!


The War of the Wizards
The releasing of the nameless Chaos-spawn from the tomb in
the Dead City in Khul was the spark that lit the flame, which
eventually grew and grew until it became the conflagration
which was the War of the Wizards in Allansia, the Great War
against Evil in Khul, and the Rise of Kakhabad in the Old
World. For centuries, Orcs, Goblins and Trolls had been
nibbling at the edges of civilization, testing the strength of the
defences. Attracted by the ascendance of sorcery in Allansia,
many evil mages had trained in solitude until they had
mastered the techniques of bringing the dead back to life as
their servants. In the Mountains of the Giants in Khul, the
inhuman races had gathered their resources under the
ignorant eyes of Khan Gyorgir and his people. In the Desert
of Skulls, the Snake People were developing magic which
would raise the temperature of the sandy wilderness and
cause its sterile wastes to expand. In every dark corner of
Kakhabad, shamans and witch-doctors manipulated the
natural forces, changing day to night and back again within
the space of a few hours. Everywhere you looked, Chaos was
slowly seeping into the world through ever-widening cracks.
The first engagement came in southern Khul, in the spring of
the year 1998 OT. As the month of Skies in Darkness turned
to Land's Awakening, the skies did not lighten in Zagoula. A
sandstorm blew across the southern lands, darkening the sky
for three weeks and bringing with it a plague of locusts and
snakes which infested the city. Messengers were sent north
to report what was happening, as everyone in the city knew
that the storm was not of natural origin. On the twenty-third
day of the storm, with the terrified inhabitants of Zagoula
cowering in their homes, the Forces of Chaos came striding
into the city, the Chaos-spawn from the Dead City leading
Trolls and Orcs, and many formless Chaotic beings. The city
was sacked, crushed beneath the weight of the obscene armies
which swarmed everywhere.
Once the southern lands had been destroyed, the Forces of
Chaos split. One army swept north-east, gathering more and
more momentum as it decimated the fertile lands at the heart
of the continent, and turned them into barren expanses of ash.
The host arrived at Kabesh, and met up with a smaller force
of Orcs and Goblins which had swept down across the
northern plains. The city was besieged, while a breakaway
force writhed and slithered north-east, heading for the city of
Anion. The other army pushed towards Shakista, the capital
of Klarash, but was halted in the Anvil Pass through the
Mountains of the Giants by a large force which had responded
to the messages of disaster coming from Zagoula. After
holding back the tide of Orcs and Goblins for five days, the
armies gave way, retreating back through the pass to take up
a new position closer to the capital, where they were joined
by reinforcements from the coastal lands. Plans were made
to abandon the capital if it became necessary .. .
THE REAVING OF ALLANSIA
The first engagement of the War of the Wizards in Allansia
was an assault on Gar-Goldoran, the capital of Goldoran,
which stood close to where the modern city of Zengis stands
today. As the first warm days of summer were beginning,
patchy bits of news began spreading about the rampaging
Forces of Chaos on Khul. Sorcerers and mystics complained
of tremendous elemental forces disrupting the natural
magical fields of Titan, and of the presence of Chaos on the
Spirit Planes. Reports reached the lord of GarGoldoran of a
massive host of Chaotic creatures assembling in the eastern
parts of the Icefinger Mountains, but before he could even
dispatch messengers to warn the surrounding lands, the
hordes of Chaos were howling at the gates of the city. But he
had forgotten the versatility of his court sorcerers, who
managed to break through the disruption of the magical fields
caused by the strong presence of Chaos, and alert their fellow
spell-casters in Carsepolis of the situation, before joining the
battle for the city.
Gar-Goldoran fell quickly, far too quickly, for it had been
unprepared, but some of the Forces of Chaos next marched
east for Fangthane, the sacred capital of the Dwarf race, which
was anything but unprepared: the Dwarfs had been expecting
this event, sooner or later, for five hundred years. Now that
the day had arrived, the Dwarfs did not worry that sacred
Fang-thane was finally under attack. Abandoning the city in
front of Fangthane, they retreated inside the mountain and
waited for the Forces of Chaos to break against it like so many
boats against a rocky coastline.
