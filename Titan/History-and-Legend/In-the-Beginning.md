The Skies of Titan
How many people on Titan never look at the night sky and
wonder about those glimmering candles in the heavens? More
learned types, the astronomers, believe that the pinpoints of
light are nothing less than other suns, possibly even circled
by planets much like our own! This is such an outlandish
concept that it may seem completely stupid to you, but the
learned star-gazers say that mathematics proves their point
– though what a few numbers have to do with the homes of
the gods only they know.
However that may be, the skies overhead are packed with
stars and other celestial phenomena. In the different lands
different names have been given and constellations picked
out, but in most lands the people firmly believe that the stars
represent the forms, deeds or domains of their patron deities.
See the two sky-charts here for examples of the forms the stars
are said to take.
The planet is lit during the day by the bright yellow sun. At
night, however, the moon shines like a cold grey lantern as it
circles the sleeping world. Like the stars, the moon is called
by many names, but every culture surprisingly believes it to
be male. The swamp-dwelling peoples of south-east Allansia
know it as Kuran, the child of Assamura the sun goddess.
Further north the sinister Darkside Elves know the sun only
as Brethin's Bane, after a legendary hero of their race who was
caught by a Wood Elf's arrow after foolishly venturing above
ground during the daylight hours; to them the moon is Tiriel,
the Silent Guardian, who they believe watches over and
protects them when they hunt under his wan light.
In some parts of the world where the Elemental Planes
encroach too greatly upon the Earthly Plane, eddies of great
magical power swirl across the face of the land, and all the
Laws of Nature are suspended. In the Baklands, the
wilderlands at the centre of Chaos-tainted Kakhabad, it is said
that day and night never follow each other at equal intervals.
At some times there, especially in spring when magical
energy is at its peak, the sun appears never to set in the
western sky for weeks on end, though in other parts of the
world the skies behave as normally as ever. For reasons such
as this, it cannot be stressed too highly how dangerous it is
to venture into the Baklands and other such areas without
very good reason!

SHAKURU, CITY OF BEGGARS
On the south-western edge of the Scythera Desert there sits the foulest city known to man. Called Shakuru, it is home only to the
Beggar-King, Holagar the Wretched, and his plague-ridden citizens. Cast out by the rest of the world, they drift to the city in their
ones and twos (though no one quite knows how they cross the storm-blown oceans where others cannot), to join their fellow
outcasts. The beggars trade with the desert Goblins and the nomadic Lizard Men, to whom all humans look revolting, and raid
barbarian settlements west of Kish, taking food and slaves.
Shakuru itself is little more than a massive pile of debris and rat-infested garbage, perpetually collapsing and being rebuilt by its
inhabitants. In the rickety temples of the city the beggars offer up praise to Disease and Decay, their patrons and spiritual lords, by
breeding rats and flies and releasing them to serve their gods by spreading unholy diseases across the world.


So that is the world of Titan, in all its tarnished glory. But how
did it come to be this way? What of its history, its heroes,
myths and legends? All we can do is repeat the words of the
legendary mystic and scholar Raljak Lying-Jackal, who
always started his books with the words, 'Read on, and all
will be revealed in time . .’
In the Beginning
But where shall we start? In the course of our studies for this
book, we have drawn on the combined knowledge of the
wisest sages of the three continents. As a result, we have
collected much information that duplicates, contradicts or
ignores other material. If we had given in to our initial urges,
simply to tell all that we heard, this book would be ten times
the size it is, and we would still be writing it! Therefore, what
we have done is chosen the tales, myths and legends which,
in our judgement, offer the clearest picture of the past of this
world. There is much that we have omitted -though we were
loath to do so - and many things have been glossed over. The
tale of King Aradax and the Scared Donkey, the legend of
Ruritag Half-Orc, the story of the Fall of the Savage Innocents,
and many others, must all wait for another book.
But where shall we start? Let us start at the beginning, with
the  creation  of Titan as taught  by the  priests of Lendleland
and Gallantaria. This account is couched in very mythical
terms, and it seems likely that much of it was initially
invented to explain the unexplainable to the primitive peoples
of prehistory.
In the days before Time had been found by the trickster god,
Logaan, and unleashed on to the world by Death, the gods
sat or lounged around the great palace of the Celestial Court.
There were a great many gods in those days, hundreds of
them, and each was different. Moreover, each god was served
by a host of lesser beings, demigods or 'lesser gods', who also
had their own personalities and their own tasks to perform.
And they were bored with their lives. There were no years,
months or days, and no one got any older and no one died,
but many were being born all the time. And nothing ever
happened that was very interesting.
All the higher gods and goddesses had magical powers, so
that they could do anything they wished. But even though
they were gods few of them had much imagination, and they
soon got tired of doing the same things all the time. True,
some deities seemed to keep themselves occupied: black
Death and his brothers, Diseases and Decay had great fun
going around dissembling gods and demigods into their
component parts, and the other gods had to come along and
put their friends back together again. But even this became
boring in time, no matter how spectacularly Death and his
cohorts presented their peculiar entertainment.

28     TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD
One day, however, the goddess known as Throff was digging
with her sister Galana in their luscious gardens. (These
gardens, incidentally, were completely different from the
'gardens' of Titan. They were places of great beauty, where
glowing crystals and light-beams grew, to the delight of the
gods and goddesses of the palace.) She had transformed her
hand into the shape of a spade, and was slowly scraping a
hole in the soil for a massive blue-green crystal which she
wished to plant, when she unearthed a large lump of magic
soil, which vibrated and pulsed with life! Throff ran to her
sister Galana, and showed her the clay; she knew just what
they should do with it.
Throff and Galana took the clay to their father Titan, who
divided it in two and then fashioned and worked at one half
with his hands until it was perfectly round. And Titan took
his creation, and set it among the Planes, so that everyone
could see. The gods of the Court were amazed by this new
idea, and they wanted to know more about it. But Death and
his brothers did not come to look, for they thought it was
going to be just another tedious diversion which would soon
pale into insignificance.
Now Titan divided the other half of the clay up among the
greater Gods. Hydana, husband to Throff, made patterns on
the sphere, which were water. Throff herself put down a large
mass of clay, which she called land. Galana fashioned trees,
flowers and plants from the clay and planted them on the
land. And one by one the gods filed up to Titan, and were
allowed to take a piece of the magical stuff and make
creatures in their own image, which were placed on his
creation, which was called Titan after him. Beautiful
Glantanka danced around it, the light of her face illuminating
it with a golden glow, and she became the sun. She was
followed by her brother, who danced in her wake, and
became the moon. But while the gods were celebrating their
new creation, Death stole some of the clay, secreting it in the
black folds of his cloak before gliding away again.
LOGAAN'S CREATION
Soon the creation was buzzing with creatures of all shapes
and sizes. And the gods walked on the new world, and played
with their creations. Hydana swam in the waters he had
made, playing with the fish and the other creatures of the
deep which Ichthys and his fellows had created. On the land,
Throff, Galana and the other creators danced and played,
delighting in the beauty of the things they had made. They
gave names to everything they had made, and laughed and
were happy. Titan looked down upon it all, and was very
pleased. But before him stepped the god Logaan, whom we
know now as the Trickster. He had been dissembled by Death
and his brothers at the time Titan was giving out clay, but
now he wanted to take his turn. Titan had kept back some
clay, for he was a wise god, and gave a little of what remained
to Logaan.
And Logaan went down to the new world, and looked at what
had been made so far. None of it was to his taste, and he
decided to make an entirely new shape. It had just two legs,
with a pair of arms higher up its body, and it was tall and
thin. But to make it special, Logaan took a piece of himself,
and placed it inside the head of his creation, and then
breathed over it, to set it going. And he called it Man.
THE ORIGINS OF THE GODS
The question of who made the gods of the Celestial Court has vexed religious men and women from the dawn of time. The race of humans
who used, before their cities were destroyed in the War of the Wizards, to dwell in the area now marked by the barren eastern coast of the
Flatlands, left records among their ruins which show that they believed the gods were made by a trio of primal beings. They called the three
Ashra, Elim and Vuh, crudely translated as Light, Dark and Life, and believed that a combination of the powers of all three helped shape
the Celestial Court. The strange peoples who dwelt on the Isles of the Dawn before the eruption of the volcano that sank most of them
beneath the waters believed that ruling over the Court there was a single god greater than all the others, who fashioned the gods and let
them create their own world. They called him Am, which meant the First, and they believed that when they died they would ascend
to the heavens to join him.


HISTORY AND LEGEND     29
THE CREATION OF THE OTHER RACES
When the other gods and goddesses saw Logaan's creation,
they laughed heartily at it, for it looked very peculiar as it
walked along on its two spindly legs. But they saw it dig in
the earth and pull up rocks, and use the rocks to cut through
trees, and use the trees to make a shelter from the water which
Hydana's brother Sukh was casting on the world. And they
saw it take its rocks, and strike them together, and make a
light as bright as heavenly Glantanka herself, which gave out
heat and kept the chill winds of Pangara away. The gods saw
that the creature could think like they could, could reason
and create, and they wondered where it had come from.
When Logaan told them he had put a bit of himself into the
creature, the gods were horrified! Many of them went back
to their creations, shocked that a god had mutilated himself.
Only Galana, Throff and Titan stayed to commiserate with
poor, foolish Logaan, for secretly they were very interested
in learning more about his creation. They asked him to show
them how he had made his 'Man', and he did so by making
another. But he had already used up that piece of himself
which he had placed in the head of Man, and so he placed
another part of himself in the heart of his second creation,
breathed upon it until it awoke, and called it Woman.
The three deities were impressed, and decided to make their
own creatures along similar lines. Titan took a part of his
strength and size, and transformed it into a Giant. Throff took
a part of her rocky skin and made the first Dwarf. And Galana
took her grace and her knowledge, and made the first Elf.
They set their creatures on the face of the world, and retired
to the palace of the Celestial Court to watch them multiply
and spread across the world alongside Man.
This period is known as the Godtime, and it was one of great
peace and happiness for the races of men, Dwarfs, Elves and
Giants. They lived together at first, but gradually divided as
their numbers became greater, each taking one part of the
world for their own. Man took the plains, Elves the forests,
Dwarfs the hills and Giants the mountains. They dwelt in fine
cities and prospered, and grew strong and healthy. They
made strange tools and weapons, with which to catch other
creatures for their food, and learnt how to use the natural
magic inherent in the earth, all under the watchful eyes of
their patron gods. During the day, golden Glantanka danced
across the heavens, and at night the moon would cast its
silvery light upon the world.
DEATH WALKS ON TITAN
But one night, Death and his brothers caught hold of the
moon, which did not rise over Titan that night. In the
darkness, the evil gods went among the races of men, Dwarfs,
Elves and Giants, and did much damage. They set dark
creatures on the world, made from the stolen clay and tainted
by their evil minds; they made them creatures of Chaos.
Xiarga, the horned snake, slithered into the world,
accompanied by Arhallogen the spider king, Basilisk the
lizard, Gargoyle and the Behemoth, a gigantic sea monster.
That same night, the creature known as Hashak the Creator
planted his own creatures, the Orcs, in the shadows and
corners of the world, where they bred and thrived in the
darkness.
When morning came, Glantanka began her dance across the
face of the world again, but looking down she could see only
thick black clouds, which hid Death's foul creatures from the
sight of the gods. By the middle of the day, the gods were
despairing of the fate of their creatures, and pondering
whether they should risk journeying down to the surface of
Titan to investigate, when Death and all his supporters filed
into the Celestial Court. With Death were his brothers,
Disease and Decay, but also a number of minor gods such as
Slangg and Tanit, and a great force of demigods, who were
ugly and bestial to look upon. Between them they carried a
large sack, in which a number of objects writhed and
wriggled. Death spoke to the stunned gods gathered there, a
chilling leer in his voice and a bottomless pit in his night-black
eyes.
'My dear friends,' Death began. 'My dear friends, I have
watched your laughable attempts at creation with great
amusement and enjoyment. The time has come, however, to
show you how it should be done. Follow me . . .' Saying this,
Death transported the gods to the surface of Titan, amid gasps
of shock and indignant protests. Looking around them, the
gods could see only darkness and smoke, but when Death
raised his hands it lifted, to reveal a landscape of carnage and
utter devastation. The lifeless bodies of men and animals lay
everywhere, and feasting on their corpses were the foul
creations of death.
Shaking the wriggling simpleton Logaan out of the sack,
Death continued his speech: 'This . . . ah .. . creature is a
complete fool, but he can be very useful now and again. While
nosing about in one of the furthest Planes, he came across
something strange, a new god, who possesses a power which
has not been heard of before. Gods and goddesses, I give you
Time!'
VARIATIONS ON THE CREATION MYTH
Various cultures have their own variations on this story. To the people of ancient Arantis, then ruled over by a dynasty of powerful warrior-queens,
Logaan gave his brain to Woman, who was created first, and then his heart to Man. Other races have believed that both creatures were made together,
and that first Man and first Woman shared head and heart with Logaan. There are also some religions which believed that it was not Logaan (usually
a very foolish god in human mythology), but a much more admirable deity such as Sukh the storm god (who is also known as Kukulak).
A rather imaginative warlock once tried to argue that everything was in fact created by Death and his brothers, but his theories were rejected
because they explained too much of what was wrong in the world!


At that the sack was upended a second time, and a repulsive
figure fell out. As it cowered in front of the assembled gods,
it seemed to change form. First it was young and smooth, like
a new-born child, then it was middle-aged and rough, before
changing again into a wrinkled old man. As it changed from
one to the next, the god Decay began to laugh deeply, while
Death outlined his terms:
'I want this miserable little creature of yours, all of it, and you
are going to give it to me. Otherwise I shall release Time into
the universe, and everything shall become mortal, and
eventually die. Time has this power, for he represents the
replacement of everything that was by everything that is to
come. If Time is released there will be no more immortality,
and even the gods will be susceptible to my power – they will
be able to die!' As one, the gods said, 'No! This shall not be!'
– at which Death and his forces turned and stormed from the
room. The First Battle was about to begin.
THE FIRST BATTLE
Death and his forces of evil retired to one of the Outer Planes,
where they readied themselves for battle. The evil gods had
not been idle while waiting for the others to react to their
assault on the world, and they had created many more
creatures of Chaos, which they formed into a gibbering,
writhing army, and marched on the Celestial Court. When
they arrived, however, they found it completely empty, for
the other gods had gone down to Titan to pull together the
Forces of Good for the battle to come.
At last the two sides faced each other across a wide, grassy
plain. On one side were the Forces of Death, led by the unholy
god and his twin brothers, wrapped in their black robes.
Alongside and behind them were snakes, wolves, basilisks,
spiders and a great many formless creatures, revolting slimy
beings which continually sprouted parts of other beings in
cruel mockery of the creations of the Lawful gods. Flying
above the army was a cloud of bats, vultures and other
creatures which had been tainted by Death's touch. A large
horde of Orcs, Trolls and Goblins stood ready for battle. And
at the rear were the demigods, including the repulsive Sith,
Ishtra, Myurr, Relem and Vradna. They had dressed
themselves in hard steel armour forged especially for the
battle, and they formed themselves into a square around
Time. The black banners of Death's army bore no motif.
Facing them were the Forces of Good, led by a vanguard of
the greater gods, including Titan, Throff, Sukh and many
others. Even gentle Galana was with them, veiled so that none
should see the fear in her eyes. In a long line to either side
were soldiers from all four races, armed and ready for battle.
Eagles and other birds of prey, led by the Hawklord himself,
swooped above them, crying out warnings to their opponents
in anticipation of the coming hunt. There were other creatures
too – centaurs, lions, tigers, and many which exist no longer.
Bringing up the rear were a host of gleaming golden Dragons,
Glantanka's own creations, prepared especially for the battle
and led by Kilanirax, once the sun goddess's servant, but now
Dragon king.
From the ranks of the evil armies, a skeletal warrior stepped
forward, and blew one harsh, discordant note on a horn; and
the battle began. The streaming Forces of Evil swept howling
down on the thin line of their enemy, while magic burst in
the air above them. The line of Dwarfs, men, Elves and Giants
held, and they returned with an assault of their own, but
heavy casualties were sustained by both sides. More attacks
were made; again and again the armies clashed.
