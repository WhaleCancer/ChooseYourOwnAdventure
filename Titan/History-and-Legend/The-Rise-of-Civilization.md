# The Rise of Civilization

The Time of Heroes
After the gods had departed from the world in the aftermath
of the First Battle, the races returned, battered but unbowed,
to their respective homelands. At about this time, writing was
first invented, and a number of puzzling records have
survived, painted on fragments of pottery and stamped on
sheets of metal.
For many hundreds of years, scholars have been digging such
things out of the ruins of the ancient cities of the world, and
they have begun to work out what they actually say in the
peculiar languages of the planet's first civilized peoples.
Now that the gods kept their distance from earthly affairs,
the first human heroes began to make their names known.
The names of kings, warriors and magicians, including vague
references to people like King Harar of Granat, Birel Brother-
slayer and Zergoul Whitelightning, begin to figure strongly
in these ancient writings, though there is still a good deal of
religious writing as well.
THE UNITED CONTINENT
At this time, all the lands of the world were still joined
together into one massive continent, which these early records
call Irritaria. It was not until almost a thousand years after
the beginning of Time that they were divided in the drowning
of Atlantis, by which time the kingdoms of the world had
risen and declined and risen again. But in those early years,
there were few such kingdoms. Men regressed from the
Golden Age of the utopian cities they had enjoyed under the
patronage of the gods, and now they struggled to survive in
competition with the teeming Orcs, Trolls, Goblins and (after
a few hundred years) the first foul Chaotic Ogres.
The Dwarfs had slipped away to their underground domains,
where they were digging ever deeper into the earth in search
of riches. In ancient mountains in the far north of Irritaria, the
Dwarf lord, Hangahar Goldseeker, was making the first
tentative bores which would eventually turn into the
enormous undying city of Fangthane, immortal home of the
Dwarf people.
The Elves, meanwhile, had returned to their beloved forests,
and were investigating their own powers of magic and
intellect. The first of the great Elven sorcerers, remembered
only as the White Lord, was communing with Galana at the
heart of the One Forest, delving deep into the fundamental
forces of magic and ritual. The One Forest, which stretched
right across the continent at that time, was the home of the
greatest number of Elves the world has ever seen: their
decline has always been in direct relation to the destruction
of their forest homes.
THE TALE OF THE HALFHAND CHIEFS
But it was the humans on whom those early archivists
concentrated. The greatest heroes of the time were a pair of
brothers, Rerek and Myzar Half hand, who cut a bloody
swath through the western lands as leaders of a tribe of
horse-riding nomads. Their battles with the Orcs of that
region are remembered by us in the form of two folk-songs,
though the minstrels of today who sing 'Riding with Half
hand' or 'Tie Down the Warrior' do not realize it!
They had ridden with their tribe across over two thousand
leagues of barren grassland, in search of a fertile land in which
to settle. But when they came across a very pleasant area of
gentle hills and valleys overlooking the endless ocean, they
found it teeming with Orcs, who were taking advantage of
the fertility of the area. The tribe was despondent after its long
trek, and immediately engaged the Orcs in pitched battle!
Surprisingly, the Orcs fought back with great ferocity. The
area was worth defending, certainly, but more importantly
there was the principle involved -humans should not be
allowed to ride around stealing other people's lands, like
spoilt children who cry every time they see something they
want.
32     TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD


The running battles against the Orcs continued for around
twenty-five years, with both sides slowly chipping away at
each other. Many heroic confrontations took place, and the
names of the Half hand brothers became known to humans
across many parts of the continent. Their dramatic ambushes,
the rescue of their kidnapped children from the Orcs' cooking-
pots and the burning of the Orcs' major town were sung about
from one side of the world to the other, and the numbers of
the humans were swelled as warriors flocked to join them.
Eventually, the sheer persistence of the human invaders drove
the Orcs into a complex of caves in the hills, where every one
of them starved to death in three months! It is a lesson to us
all to reflect that it was very definitely the humans who were
in the wrong in this case, but it is also the humans who are
celebrated as the heroes!
THE SPLITTING OF THE LANDS
Gradually, the wandering tribes began to settle down
throughout the continent, for agriculture took over from
hunting as the main source of food and the distant lands were
explored and found to be fertile. Slowly but surely, mankind
gathered itself together into small villages, which grew into
towns, and then into small cities, and finally into nations.
Trade began, and nation communicated with nation. But at
the same time, nation fought with nation - as is the way of
humans who compete for the best things, be they land,
precious metals or whatever. It was at this time that it is
believed that the tyrant Faramos XXIII - really the Demon
Prince Myurr - rose in Atlantis, which was promptly sunk
beneath the waves by the combined actions of the outraged
gods. Unfortunately, very little information has ever been
discovered  about this time, for most  contemporary  records
seem deliberately to have blotted the whole epoch from their
memories. It is as if the whole world wished to forget
whatever atrocities the people of Atlantis had inflicted. For
what few details we have managed to glean of this time, you
should read the later section on the underwater kingdoms of
Titan, which gives more background to this cataclysmic event.
As penance for the crazed actions of the Atlanteans, the gods
apparently split the lands and formed the three continents.
Such drastic action cost the lives of many beings and
creatures, as gigantic waves flooded the coastal regions while
the landmasses were driven to their new resting-places. The
One Forest of the Elves was split into many parts, and the
long, slow decline of the Elven peoples began. Sections of the
One Forest still survive in some lands, such as the enormous
Forests of Night near present-day Sardath in north-east
Allansia, and around Lake Nekros in Khul, but they are a pale
shadow of the magnificent, continent-spanning wall of
greenery that the One Forest must have been.
The Rise of Civilization
After the long, slow haul to civilization, the cataclysm
surrounding the splitting of the continents set mankind back
at least five hundred years. When the blackened skies had
finally cleared and the waters had receded, man found
himself scattered across the globe. The only cities which had
not been turned to ruins by the wrath of the gods were those
built into mountains by Dwarfs. But slowly, by degrees,
mankind began to organize again.
The first major settlements in the new lands began to grow
about 350-400 years after the sinking of Atlantis, on the coasts
of all three continents; again, small villages turned into towns,
and towns eventually became cities and then states. The
central eastern coastline of Khul was home to a thriving
collection of small trading towns, which eventually began
gathering themselves into a unified state known as Klarash
around the year 1510 OT (or Old Time). On the shores of the
Onyx Sea, in what is now Gallantaria in the Old World, Orjan
the Builder started gathering his tribe around him and
building a town. And along the edges of Allansia, a few states
began to establish their power; the city of Vynheim, which
still exists, was founded as a small fishing settlement in 1530
by the father of the legendary northern hero, Bjorngrim
Giant-slayer.
BJORNGRIM OF VYNHEIM
Bjorngrim Bjorngrimsson was a typical northman -large,
broad-shouldered and red-haired, and with a lust for strong
ale and honourable battle. On the death of his father in 1583
o T, he became chief of a thriving port, which traded with
other settlements further down the treacherous coast and,
across what was then called the Witch Sea, with the people
who dwelt on the string of islands known as the Giant's Teeth.
The Witch Sea was a very dangerous place, fog-bound in the
HISTORY AND LEGEND     33


summer and full of deadly icebergs in the winter: the people
of Vynheim believed it was haunted by the ghosts of those
mariners who had been wrecked there, and who still wailed
forlornly. After four boats were lost in a month, the people of
Vynheim became afraid, and would not set sail.
So it was up to their leader, Bjorngrim, to prove both his
bravery and the safety of the waters. He set out single-handed
in a small ketch, The Lusty Dwarf, either to prove that there
was nothing to be afraid of, or to face up to whatever was
haunting the Witch Sea. He sailed for eight days, being blown
north towards the Iceberg Straits by fierce gales. The
temperature dropped and icicles formed on the boat, while
icebergs bobbed around him, but the northman kept his tiller
straight, knowing that his gods would see him through. On
the ninth day a fog closed in, and from its depths he heard a
wailing, moaning sound. Suddenly a heart-stoppingly tall Sea
Giant rose out of the waters with a crash of grinding ice, and
reached out for the boat with one massive green hand.
Bjorngrim gritted his teeth, muttered a hasty curse, and made
ready with his axe. But as the hand scooped down, he saw a
better plan.
His heart in his mouth, he leapt on to the hand, and kept on
running. Although the Giant was covered with ice, its skin
was also pitted and gave the north-man the grip he needed
to reach the titanic shoulders. There he paused for a split
second, gazing up into the eyes which regarded him with an
intelligence so slow he felt sure he could hear it creaking,
before swinging a colossal blow at the Sea Giant's neck. The
axe bit deep, and a gush of freezing blood knocked Bjorngrim
backwards, down into the water. When he surfaced again, he
was only a few arm-lengths from his boat, which he pulled
himself into just as the Giant's brain received the message
from its body that it was dead, and that it should fall over.
Ten days later, Bjorngrim Giant-slayer sailed into Vynheim
Sound, towing the body of the Sea Giant behind him. The
people of Vynheim bestowed his nickname upon him
immediately, and also renamed the Witch's Sea, so that even
now it is known as Bjorngrim's Sea.
THE AGE OF WIZARDS
Around the year 1650, the continent now known as Allansia
was divided up into a large number of peaceful kingdoms
and principalities. The largest of these was Allansia itself,
which stretched from the White-water River as far north as
the River Kok. Its capital, Carsepolis, was a wide, well-
constructed cityport, which managed to be both a seat of
culture and a place of protection against the tribes of Orcs and
other inhuman races which still rampaged around the
northern plains. Ruling over Carsepolis at this time was the
Dynasty of Swords, founded in 1601 by King Coros Sword-
bearer, and now represented by his grandson Coros III (also
known, it appears, as the Oath-breaker, though no records
that we have seen indicate why or how the young king
acquired such a damning name).
From the River Kok north and east the country of Goldoran
ran as far as the northern edge of the Flatlands (which even
in those days were desolate and primitive, home only to the
superstitious builders of stone monuments and to nomads).
South of the Whitewater River, the Southern Plains were
crisscrossed with the trails of merchants and adventurers,
who travelled between the small interior town of Salamonis
and the two walled city-states of Cutsilver and Balkash, which
lay in the middle of the plains and on the coast respectively.
The Desert of Skulls, to the south of the plains, was much
smaller then, and apparently less dangerous too. There were
several small cities clustered along the southern extent of the
Craggen Mountains, where you will now find only a few
villages on the rarely used road between Warp-stone and
Wolftown. Merchants travelled far and wide across the
continent in search of new markets, and returned to the
northern lands with fragrant oils and spices, and tales of the
exotic eastern lands which at that time circled the Sea of Pearls
and the Shabak Peninsula.
Further south, the city of Kaynlesh-Ma, founded around 1585
0 T as a small port at the mouth of the River Eltus and now
nominal capital of the country of Arantis, was growing in
prominence, and trade was just being started with the tiny
cityport of Halak (its partner Rimon started as an overspill
for Halak two hundred years later) and the country of
Allansia and its neighbours. Kaynlesh-Ma, however, was a
very different place from the northern city-states, for it was
home to an increasing number of sorcerers.
High magic at that time was very much the province of the
Elves, who had a long tradition of its use and practice. By
now, however, the Elves had withdrawn into their forests,
and their high sorcerers were never seen by any but the very
luckiest humans and the unluckiest Orcs. What most people
thought of when magic was mentioned were the tricks of
hedge-wizards  and old  women for  keeping  fleas off or for

making village maidens fall in love with you. The shamans
of the Orcs and Goblins still practised their magic, but it was
so warped and perverted from the pure beauty of the original
that it could not be considered in the same context. The magic
of Orc shamans tended, and still tends, to be a very repetitive
cycle of conjuring up the spirits of ancestors to ask for
guidance for the future, and the casting of luck spells before
battle, all tied up with a great deal of very tedious mumbo-
jumbo.
In the depths of Arantis, a number of scholars had discovered
an ancient temple, purporting to be from the earliest ages of
history. It was haunted by the spirits of a trio of ancient
sorcerers, who had reappeared on the Earthly Plane because
they had decided it was time that the world knew of sorcery
again. The scholars, who – the histories tell us –numbered
five, but who obviously did not have very memorable names,
immediately leapt at the chance of learning secrets which had
been lost to mankind for many millennia. They refurbished
the temple at Aranath, as the place was known, and began
the slow task of learning the deepest secrets of high magic.
As the sorcerers grew more and more engrossed in their
studies, they were commanded to travel the earth, acquiring
knowledge for the temple and teaching their skills as they
went.
This began in the 1690s, and by 1712 the noted sorcerer
Erridansis had arrived in Salamonis and founded the school
of magic based at the centre of the nearby Forest of Yore
(which in those days stretched from the Vale of Willow to the
very fringes of Darkwood). Wizardry became a much-
respected profession, as every nobleman in the land tried to
better King Salamon by sponsoring a greater sorcerer. Several
schools of wizardry were founded, in Carsepolis and in
GarGoldoran, the capital city of Goldoran, and the air over
the northern lands was always full of staff-riding sorcerers
and the flash of magic!
There were wars in those days, of course, for there are wars
wherever man hoards gold and other possessions and keeps
them away from other men. But with the advent of court
sorcerers, a good deal of bloodshed was avoided by sending
them away to desolate moors and making them fight a duel,
with appropriate penalties being incurred by the country of
the loser. Moreover, the threats of Orcs and Goblins receded
for a time as they met with frightening resistance in the form
of fire-wielding sorcerers who blasted away with wild magic
and cut great holes through their ranks! For a while, at least,
Orcs were reduced to sneaking through settled countries at
night, for fear of attracting the attentions of the sorcerers who
led the armies of Allansia.
HISTORY AND LEGEND     35


THE CITY-STATES OF THE OLD
WORLD
While sorcerous powers were growing in prominence in
Allansia, far across the Western Ocean other things were
happening. The Old World has always been a far more
civilized continent than either Allansia or Khul, which can in
part be put down to the fact that there have, in recent years,
been few wars cataclysmic enough to set the rise of
civilization back at all.
As the darkened skies created in the destruction of Atlantis
slowly began to clear, the varied peoples of the Old World
were already beginning to settle down and take the first
tentative steps on the road towards civilization. Before the
continents had been split by the gods as penance for the evil
of Atlantis, the peoples of the one continent, which we call
Irritaria, wandered far and wide, bringing some uniformity
to every land. After the split, the same people could still be
found on each continent, so that there were horse-nomads on
the Flatlands of Allansia and in the corresponding area on the
other side of the Ocean of Serpents, the plains of Lendleland.
But gradually the many peoples began changing, and
different lands produced their own cultures. Isolated from
the other two continents, the Old World developed a strange,
rather quirky series of cultures, very different from those of
Khul and Allansia, which, in turn, are different from each
other.
At the centre of the Old World there are the nearly
uncrossable heights of Mauristatia, which have meant that
man has tended to settle on the coastal plains around them.
The first major settlements we have records of were on the
coast of the Onyx Sea. In 1430 OT, the character every
Gallantarian schoolchild knows as Orjan the Builder brought
his tribe down across the plains from the southern highlands
they had roamed for many hundreds of years, and began
building a small village where two rivers joined. He called it
Lendle, an old mountain-man's word for flat plains, which
described the countryside around the village very well.
Orjan's people found other small villages on the plains,
inhabited by men and women much like themselves. Trading
began, and slowly the villages grew into small walled towns.
After his father's death in 1464, Orjan's son, Regulus the
Unifier, took over the leadership of Lendle. As the prosperity
of the region grew in leaps and bounds, more and more
settlements began to grow in the shadow of Lendle, until, in
1498, a treaty between eight of the largest towns created the
nation of Gallantaria. Its ruler was Regulus, and its capital
was Lendle or, more properly now, Royal Lendle.
Gallantaria grew quickly under the inspired leadership of
Regulus. His warriors brought the benefits of his rule to
neighbouring lands, and slowly but surely the borders moved
back as other towns and villages realized the benefits of
belonging to Gallantaria. Gallantaria spread northwards,
bringing peace and prosperity to the people who were
beginning to settle along the Whitewater River. Further north,
however, the Gallantarians found themselves faced with the
insurmountable mass of the Cragrock Peaks.
They also found themselves faced with the Nether-world
Sorcerers. These mystical spell-casters lived in a small colony
high up in the Cragrocks, from where they looked down on
the southern lands. They had been living there for as long as
any of the local hillmen could remember, and they were a
perilous people. In Gallantaria, and indeed in the whole of
the northern lands, spell-casters were few and far between.
As the tribes had slowly settled down and founded villages,
their shamans became sorcerers, but the tradition of high
magic in Gallantaria was only a hundred years old; the
Netherworld Sorcerers had been practising it for centuries
before the continents were broken up! They resisted every
attempt by the forces from Gallantaria to bring 'civilization'
to the Cragrocks, turning Regulus's first son into a standing
stone, and his second and third into a pair of stunted oak
trees.
The Gallantarians, therefore, looked in other directions for
the expansion of their realm. Heading east across the wide,
fertile lands as far as what is now called the Border River,
they found small hamlets and villages who stated that they
owed no allegiance to King Regulus, for they were already
pledged to the Lords of Brice. Another nation had risen and
