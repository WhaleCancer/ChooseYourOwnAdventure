HISTORY AND LEGEND     41
When the attackers arrived, the Dwarfs were mildly
disappointed, for they were mostly cowardly Orcs and Trolls,
with few creatures of Chaos to offer them any sort of
challenge at all. After allowing the repulsive army to burn the
city and then batter itself against the impregnable defences
of the citadel for two weeks, the Dwarfs became impatient
and went out to meet the Forces of Chaos with cold steel.
Three days of solid fighting, and the invaders were no more,
but with typical grimness the Dwarfs realized that the main
strength must have been diverted elsewhere, and that they
should march to reinforce the humans of the western lands.
Leaving behind merely token defences, the Dwarfs marched
for Allansia.
The main force had, in fact, turned for the Flatlands, and
swept across them like a forest fire through dry brushwood,
heading for Trolltooth Pass and Allansia. The citadel of
Durang on the edges of the Flatlands proved only a minor
irritation to the Forces of Chaos, and was pulled to pieces by
a mass of formless monstrosities. At Trolltooth Pass, however,
a force from Salamonis awaited them, reinforced by the Grand
Wizard of Yore and five other spell-casters. As the
unstoppable black tide of writhing, howling Evil slid towards
them through the narrowest part of the pass, the forces of
Salamonis broke rank and fled back through it. But at the far
end they turned and stood their ground, as the sorcerers
raised a massive wall of flame across the pass, dividing the
evil army in two. Now that the enemy had been cut down to
a more manageable size, the soldiers of Salamonis laid into
them for all they were worth, and drove them back into the
wall of flames, while on the other side the unstoppable army
of Chaos pushed more and more bodies into the fire.
Eventually the commanders of the Forces of Chaos managed
to call back their troops, and they retreated into the
Moonstone Hills. Here they met up with reinforcements in
the form of several thousand Orcs, and a dozen Dark Elf
warrior-sorcerers, who guided the foul army through the hills
and on to the Pagan Plains, where they raced towards
Carsepolis, hard on the heels of the heroes of Trolltooth Pass,
who reached the capital just in front of them. As the Forces
of Chaos swirled around the hastily prepared defences, many
of the ancient city's citizens fully believed that the end of the
world had come.
THE BATTLEGROUNDS OF CHAOS
As the breakaway section of the Forces of Chaos slithered
across Khul towards Anion, it was met and ambushed by
soldiers from that city led by the legendary hero Brendan
Bloodaxe, who had hidden among the trees of the Old Forest
near Corda, before sweeping round in a pincer movement
which caught the evil armies by surprise. Many men were
lost that day, as the armies battled back and forth across the
plain, but in the final rays of the setting sun that evening
Blood-axe looked down over the field of carnage to see only
humans standing. They worked throughout the night,
burning the foul corpses of the vanquished foe lest they
corrupt the land, before marching for Kabesh in the light of
dawn.
They arrived far too late, and found only smoking ruins and
a great many corpses. The evil army had pulverized the city,
and then raced away to the west, to reinforce the other army
at Shakista, which was finally being pinned down. Pushing
his troops to the limits of human endurance, Bloodaxe raced
across the ash wastes left by the Chaotic horde, and fell on
them from behind just as they reached the edges of the battle
for Shakista. The human defenders had held the disgusting
invaders back for eleven days, and were finally winning
against them. The arrival of the armies of Anion cut off any
hope of retreat for the Forces of Chaos, who were squashed
like an apple in a vice, and with much the same result. The
fighting lasted for nine more days, but at the end of it the
armies of Chaos were no more, though much of Shakista had
suffered too, and it eventually had to be demolished. The
incursion of Chaos into Khul had cost all the parties
concerned very dear. The Orcs and Goblins were all but
finished as a major force for several hundred years, the
humans had lost many fine cities and thousands of warriors
and civilians, and worst of all, the centre of the land had been
blighted by the taint of Chaos, and would never recover.
THE LAST BATTLE
The final battle was the Siege of Carsepolis. At the start of the
battle, the defenders of the ancient capital of Allansia
numbered around eighteen thousand, including women and
children, who readied themselves for battle alongside the
men. The Forces of Chaos were uncountable, but lined much
of the horizon beneath thick clouds of giant bats and choking
black smoke. As the battle commenced, hordes of Goblins
brought up siege-engines – catapults, battering-rams and
siege-towers. As a hail of black arrows rained down from the


sky to keep defenders from the battlements, the Goblins
manoeuvred the engines into position, and began smashing
their way into the city. Whenever they breached a section of
the wall, they met with very strong resistance, but no matter
how many human warriors held out against them, their
numbers were ultimately limited, while the Orcs and Goblins
just kept on coming. After three days – during which time
great piles of Orc and Goblin bodies were heaped up, but at
a heavy cost to the defenders – the walls were abandoned,
and the defenders took to the streets, ensuring that the evil
armies paid for every step of the way in hundreds of black-
clad corpses.
THE SIEGE OF CARSEPOLIS
The fighting continued in this manner for two weeks, after
which almost three quarters of the city had been demolished
and two thirds of the defenders were dead. The rest were
gathered around the palace of the king, awaiting the final
assault. But as the familiar shapes began creeping across the
rubble towards them, an uproar arose from the rear of the
evil army. A combined force of Dwarfs from Fangthane and
Elves from Darkwood and from the Forests of Night had
arrived, catching the Chaotic Forces by surprise. The sound
of Dwarf voices raised in a battle-hymn accompanied the flash
of Elf magic as it lit the sky in a hundred places. The defenders
took heart, and went out to meet the enemy for the last time.
But this time the gods were with them. One moment the
humans were crushed by a wall of Goblins and Orcs, and the
next their enemies were dead, and there were only Dwarfs
and Elves there, each and every one covered from head to toe
in the foul blood of their vanquished foe. The war was won!
The New Age
In the aftermath of the War of the Wizards and the Great War
against Evil there was much to be done, but there was also
much that could not be undone. In Allansia, many cities and
towns had been destroyed by the armies of Chaos, but in Khul
they had poisoned the earth itself, turning vast areas into ash
wastes, fit for nothing at all. In view of the apocalyptic nature
of the events of 1998 o T, a new dating system was introduced.
It took the year which would have been 1999 o T as Year One
of the New Age. From then until the present day, we have
referred to dates as AC, or After Chaos; as you no doubt
know, we are now in 284 A C.
ALLANSIA AFTER CHAOS
In the two and a half centuries since the incursions of Chaos
across Allansia, little has happened to the continent. So many
settlements were destroyed, and so many people killed, that

the old kingdoms like Goldoran ceased to exist. In a few
places new kingdoms immediately sprang up to replace the
old ones, and life continued much as before, but in most areas
life had been blighted by the war. In the early years of the
New Age famine and plague were common, finishing off the
gruesome job that the powers of Evil had started.
The ruins of Carsepolis were tainted by Chaos, and many
ghosts were seen wandering the battlefield late at night. The
city was abandoned by its survivors, most of whom were
given refuge in Salamonis and the Vale of Willow, and in
newer, expanding towns like Chalice and Shazaar. In time,
most of the ruins of Carsepolis gradually crumbled, but those
of the dock area – which had hardly been touched by the war
–remained. They attracted brigands and thieves, who used
them as a ready-made hideout, perpetuating the stories of
their ghostly inhabitants to keep inquisitive people away.
Soon a whole colony of evil-doers was living in the ruins,
which were slowly turning back into a town. Over the course
of perhaps fifty years, the city which is Port Blacksand rose
from the ruins. Its first ruler was Prince Olaf Twohorse, who
will be remembered in history as the man who started a
prison colony on isolated Fire Island. He was succeeded by
Baron Valentis, another corrupt nobleman, who in turn was
replaced by the infamous Lord Azzur.
In other parts of Allansia the reminders of the past faded or
crumbled away. The Flatlands are still littered with the ruins
of villages and fortifications from the war, now home only to
rats and ghosts. The Dwarfs and Elves from the north-east
were feted for many months for their part in the defeat of Evil,
but eventually had to return home. The Elves went back to
their forests, and slipped out of sight of man again. The
Dwarfs returned to sacred Fangthane, and slowly set about
rebuilding the city at the foot of the mountain. Some ruins
still remain, reminding the Dwarfs of the war, but most were
cleared away and replaced by completely new buildings and
streets.
Civilization has been notoriously slow in returning to
Allansia, which is as uncivilized a place now as it was a
thousand years ago. The land is wild, with monsters and
inhuman races lurking in the hills, and even daring to raid
the lowlands now and again. Dark sorcerers still dabble in
powerful magic, though they do not understand much of
what they are playing with any more. And heroes still stalk
the wilderlands, looking for adventure – and finding it!
KHUL AFTER CHAOS
Unlike Allansia, Khul clung on to some civilization, though
it had been sorely shaken by the war. The ruins of Shakista
and the surrounding countryside were abandoned, and a new
capital was built at Ximoran. The ruling family was
reinstated, but after only sixty years the last king died without
leaving an heir. The land is now ruled by the Council of
Seven, made up of representatives from each of the major
towns of the land.
In other parts of the world, the recovery was not so quick.
Zagoula faded into ruins, abandoned by humanity because
of the terrible ghosts which clung on to some semblance of
existence there. The southern towns of Yaziel and Hyennish
escaped almost intact, and they survive to this day, but with
the decline of Zagoula they have become isolated from the
lands further north. Kabesh has gone the same way as
Zagoula, though its ruins are very difficult to find now. They
have been buried beneath the Wastes of Chaos, the name
given by all inhabitants of Khul to the desolate ash wastes
which choke the heart of the continent.
North-east of the ruins of Kabesh are the Battlegrounds, the
remains of the plains where Brendan Bloodaxe's army
defeated one of the armies of Chaos. It is a pleasant area of
grassland, but here and there are great bare patches where
nothing grows, and which animals will not cross. People who
know the area say that these are the places where the bodies
of the dead warriors of Chaos are buried, and that at certain
times their spirits wander the plains, howling out for
resurrection.
The city of Arion fared better than most, being left unscathed
by the war – though many of its warriors did not return home.
Over the last two centuries it has grown slightly, and become
the largest city in the north-east, ruled over by the
descendants of Brendan Bloodaxe himself.
