# The Time of Heroes

**Source:** CB77003 - Titan

Bodies were falling everywhere, and the gods of Good were
looking at one another in despair. Screaming in anger, Death
and his brothers gathered their powers and let a thunderbolt
fly at the gods opposite them. It struck Throff, burning her
skin terribly, but was answered with another bolt from her
sister Galana, the Dragon king Kilanirax and the sun goddess
Glantanka. The bolt flew straight through the heart of the evil
armies, passing through the creatures of darkness and Chaos
as if they were not there, just as the sun chases away shadows,
just as strength and goodness will always cut through the
worst excesses of Evil. It struck Time and blew him apart,
with a thunderclap that reverberated across the cosmos. The
dark gods were surrounded; without Time they were
powerless to fight back and their forces fled in disarray. But
Time was scattered throughout the world of Titan, and thus
all its peoples are mortal, while the gods are not.
Titan, as spokesman for the gods, asked for the captured Dark
Lords to be killed, but Throff pleaded for them only to be
exiled, for killing them would be an act of Evil. And so the
Dark Lords and their minions were banished into the Void,
where they could do little harm. And the gods left the surface
of Titan, feeling ashamed that they had already brought so
much pain and suffering to their beautiful creation. Now they
look down on the planet from the sky every night, for ever
frozen as the stars in the poses they took up while trying to
protect the world from the effects of Time. They will never
grow old, for they are gods, but now mortal beings will
always age and die, after their allotted span. Some races are
protected by the gods, who help them stay alive for more than
their time, but in the end all will go to their graves.
