# Lord Azzur, The Tyrant of Blacksand

**Source:** CB77003 - Titan

The Archmage
There is far too much that we do not know about the
Archmage of Mampang, far too much. We have no record of
where he was born, of what nationality he is, nor of who his
parents were – if he had any, that is. It is not known who
trained him in the rudiments of dark magic, nor where he
served his apprenticeship.
Whatever his origins, however, all know of him now, for he
is lord and master of the foul citadel of Mampang, where he
trains his evil armies of inhuman warriors, and from where
he threatens to enslave all of Kakhabad under his rule. When
he came to High Xamen, he was already in his late twenties,
and the whole area was uninhabited. But he gathered around
him all manner of Goblins, Orcs, Trolls and many other
unintelligent servants of Evil and Chaos, and began to build
what was eventually going to be Mampang, the Citadel of the
Archmage.
At first the makeshift camps of the builders were subject to
attacks from the Bird Men of the area, the Schinn, who quite
understandably did not want any foul sorcerer building his
big black citadel in their lands. The Archmage made a
pretence of wanting to meet and discuss the matter, but when
the leaders of the Bird Men arrived to confer with the wizard,
he had them killed. He then negotiated with other Bird Men,
the traditional enemies of the protesting faction, offering to
keep them supplied with gold and jewels in exchange for their
help in keeping the Schinn away.
Eventually, after many years of construction, the fortress of
Mampang was finished, and the Archmage and his evil
servants took up residence. For perhaps thirty or forty years
the Archmage continued to study the arcane arts, summoning
Demons and making pacts with them in return for greater
and greater power, growing ever more proficient in the
practice of dark magic.
THE SEVEN SERPENTS
At about this time, ten or fifteen years ago, legend says that
the Archmage fought a notable battle. All the while the
sorcerer was studying his black sorcery, his foul servants were
raiding further and further afield, bringing terror to many
isolated settlements in BadduBak and along the banks of
near-by Lake Ilklala . But it was while they were exploring
caves overlooking Avanti Wood, on the far side of Xamen,
that they found the Hydra.
The titanic battle lasted two full days, during which wild
magic flashed around the mountain peaks and the Archmage
received, apart from severe burns, a deep wound, whose scar
apparently runs from his neck to his right knee. But the Hydra
was finally dead.
So impressed was the Archmage by the strength and prowess
of this formidable foe that he took its seven heads and cast
powerful and intricate spells on them. Then, summoning all
his necromantic skills, he resurrected them as seven winged
serpents! As a cruel joke perhaps, or possibly because he still
believed in them at that point, he assigned each snake to one
of the gods of the Old World. Glantanka's power was given
to the Sun Serpent; Lunara's to the Moon Serpent. Four more
serpents were aligned respectively with earth, air, fire and
water, and the last was given the power of Chronada, the
obscure Kakhabadian god of time. The Seven Serpents serve
him still, it is said, bringing information to him from all over
the festering lands.
And now rumours say he has the wondrous Crown of Kings,
stolen by Bird Men from the king of Analand! We can only
shudder to think of the power he can now wield. He will not
stop at Kakhabad, you can be sure of that, no matter how
unruly it is – the whole of the Old World may not be safe from
his plans of conquest, once he has tasted the rotten fruits of
tyranny.
THE FACES OF EVIL AND CHAOS   105


Lord Azzur, the Tyrant of
Blacksand
Last, but definitely not least, we come full circle to where we
started our journeying across Titan, in Port Blacksand, the
heart of settled Allansia, the true 'land of adventure'. What a
city! More evil even than Khare, the Cityport of Traps from
the wild lands of Kakhabad, it sits at the heart of Allansia like
an open sore on a dying leper! Even those who dwell there
call it 'the City of Thieves', for it attracts every pirate, brigand,
assassin, thief and evil-doer for hundreds of leagues around.
Danger lurks in every corner of every street, as the strong
prey on the weak, and the weak prey on one another. Over
Blacksand, however, rules the biggest thief of them all, the
mysterious Lord Azzur.
Azzur has ruled over Port Blacksand for at least thirty years
now. He came to power after he wrested control from its
previous master, one Baron Valentis, in a subtle take-over of
the city which involved poisoning the head of the militia,
beheading Valentis's brother, blockading the harbour with
pirate ships, and hanging the baron from the highest tower
of his palace! As to who Azzur is, however, there are many
theories – you will find several in every tavern of an evening
– but few know the truth. Except for a few rare occasions,
Azzur has kept himself out of view ever since he took over
the city, and always works through the black-clad Azzur
Guard.
The pirate connection worries many citizens, and some say
Azzur is the brother of the famous brigand, Garius of Halak;
others even say he is Garius of Halak! The fact that his crest
shows a boat on a wave-topped sea flanked by the sun and
moon, has added great weight to such theories. Extensive
research by the great historian, scholar and traveller, Zelakar
of Chalannabrad, however, has finally revealed Lord Azzur's
true background.
AZZUR'S PAST LIFE
Lord Varek Azzur was born of noble parents in the city of
Anion, far, far away from Port Blacksand in the north-eastern
corner of Khul. Anion, like all cities, is inhabited by both the
good and the bad, the Lawful and the Chaotic. To the young
Azzur, the darker side of existence always held the most
attraction. He was fascinated by the bizarrely clad
worshippers of strange deities such as Kukulak, the Khulian
god of storms, whose devotees always went about completely
swathed in thick black robes. When he reached the age of
sixteen, he sneaked into Kukulak's temple during a mass, and
learnt why his worshippers were always dressed so: as part
of their initiation, burning brands were applied to their faces
and bodies, causing great weals and scars. If the scars formed
themselves into Kukulak's runes, the acolyte was accepted; if
not, he was taken from the temple and disposed of. Azzur
was caught that night, lurking in the shadows at the rear of
the temple, after accidentally kicking over a large brass
candle-stand. He was given a simple choice – either to take
the test of the flame, or to die there and then.
The burns were made, and they formed themselves into
Kukulak's runes before the disappointed eyes of the high
priest. Azzur was suddenly an initiate of Kukulak, the god
of storms! Fearing what his parents would say when they saw
his face, Azzur fled Anion on board a merchant's ship bound
for Corda. On the way, however, the ship was raided by
pirates operating out of the Rockwall Islands, who enslaved
the fitter members of the ship's company and threw the rest

to the sharks. The pirate captain (his name and the name of
his ship are not known) was intrigued by the black-wrapped
boy with the scarred face, and he allowed him to become his
cabin boy.
Here Azzur's trail went cold on Zelakar for some time, apart
from a number of unconfirmed reports of a brave pirate
warrior with a heavily scarred face who served with a captain
operating out of the Arrowhead Islands. Nine years after he
fled Arion, Varek Azzur turned up in Merluk, the small port
on the extreme south-eastern tip of Allansia, in charge of a
pirate galley called The Face of Chaos. He sailed into the
harbour at Merluk flying the skull and crossbones, boarded
three ships just making ready to set sail, and quite openly
emptied their holds of several thousand Gold Pieces' worth
of goods before sailing away again! Azzur had obviously
learnt how to make an entrance in his years as a pirate!
Azzur spent the next six years raiding ships along the entire
southern coastline, from the Strait of Knives to Kaynlesh-Ma,
until he had acquired a fleet of galleys, several hundred
fanatically loyal men, and enough money to buy most of the
southlands! Instead, however, his attentions turned towards
Port Black-sand, which at the time was a small, shabby
principality run by the ageing Baron Valentis. Gathering
together his forces, he quickly took control of the city, where
he has ruled ever since.
PORT BLACKSAND UNDER AZZUR
Azzur's rule has been a harsh one. The city has become a
haven for all kinds of evil-doers, and it is no longer safe for
an ordinary man to walk the streets –not that most are
actually able to, for Azzur has imposed a stringent system of
passes. This is enforced by his black-clad town militia, which
includes Trolls and Ogres among its number. The passes are
expensive, and vary according to what a person wishes to do:
one is needed to enter the city, another to leave again; one is
required to drink in certain taverns, another to enter a temple,
and yet another to trade. It gets quite impossible on the days
when the militiamen are sticking to their master's rules and
are checking everyone!
Of Lord Azzur the citizens have seen little, and only two
people in Port Blacksand have ever seen his face. One is his
personal holy man, who brings the wisdom of Kukulak to
Azzur once a month; the other is an incredibly over-confident
thief, who now rests in pieces in various parts of the city after
creeping into Azzur's private chambers one night! Azzur
drives everywhere in an ornate golden coach, his face hidden
behind darkened windows. If he has to appear in public,
which he does rarely, he always dresses in black robes which
swathe him completely. The gates of his ugly, elaborate palace
are never open to visitors.
The city is, as mentioned right at the start of this volume, built
on the ruins of the dockland area of a much older city called
Carsepolis. Some of the deeper cellars and sewers lead down
into the ruins, which still lie beneath the city, and many tales
are told of the strange beings which haunt them. Every so
often people disappear from their beds in the night, leaving
only a few scraps of clothing and a smell like a thousand rats.
When people hear of another disappearance, they just make
the appropriate signs to their gods and point to the ground
beneath their feet with a gulp! Occasionally, young
adventurers full of bravado (or ale) boast of making a special
journey into the ancient ruins to search for treasure, but those
who try it rarely return, and none who do speak of what they
saw there.
Since Port Blacksand is at the entrance to the Catfish River,
right at the centre of settled Allansia, a lot of merchant traffic
passes by it, generally in groups escorted by heavily armed
galleys in case of piracy. Far fewer dock now than in the past,
however, for they know that their wares will be stolen from
their holds in the night, or their crews will be replaced by
others who will mutiny and take their ships half-way through
the voyage. Port Blacksand has an infamous reputation
among honest seafarers the length and breadth of the coast,
and even some pirates fear to enter it at certain times of the
year.
It is a great place for hopeful adventurers, however, who seem
to enjoy mixing with the rough and the violent. Many pass
through in search of a boat and passage up or down the coast
– or even out across the Western Ocean to distant Kakhabad
or Analand. The taverns of Port Blacksand are always packed
with warriors and would-be magicians, telling tales of their
heroics or just sitting listening to those of other adventurers.
But you need your wits about you if you are to survive even
a single night in the City of Thieves. It is not a place for an
inexperienced country boy with designs on being an
adventurer. We say again –beware Blacksand!
