Sukumvit and Carnuss
They say there is no bond so strong in this world as brotherly
love, but that clearly does not always apply. Once, many years
ago, there were two young brothers, the sons of Baron Arkat
Charavask, who at that time was ruler of the prosperous
northern trading city of Fang. Fang was, and is, the capital of
the small but rich province of Chiang Mai, which lies just
north of old Allansia. The border with that land is the River
Kok, a fast-flowing torrent which brings barges and merchant
ships from as far away as the city of Zengis in Kaypong to the
north, and from the Western Ocean and beyond the other
way. Baron Arkat was exceedingly rich, and his two fine sons
wanted for nothing.
But Carnuss was very jealous of his brother; he felt that
Sukumvit was getting far too much of his father's attention.
Sukumvit, as eldest son, could expect to inherit the rule of
Chiang Mai on the death of Baron Charavask, so much of his
time was spent in accompanying his father to learn the task
of rulership: they were together on state visits, at the court
hearing complaints from citizens, hawking or hunting, and
on the training-fields where Sukumvit was learning the use
of sword and lance.
While this was going on, Carnuss Charavask was being
taught a great many very tedious things by the court sorcerer,
Zaragan the Wrinkled, who was a very learned, but also very
boring teacher. From the room at the top of the ramshackle
tower where the wizard lived, Carnuss could see his brother
jousting or hunting with the dogs - doing all the things that
Carnuss longed to do. But no, he was not destined for such
greatness. In his mind, even at that young age, he nurtured a
hatred that would last for many decades.
When his elder brother was twenty-one, Baron Arkat died,
and Sukumvit was immediately proclaimed Baron of Fang.
Carnuss, only a year younger, felt angry that his brother
should acquire so much wealth and power just like that, and
he plotted to get even. He began mixing with thieves and
assassins in the seedy bars in the slum areas of Fang, getting
in with a dangerous crowd. He would slump there, every
evening, muttering how much he would like to kill his
brother. Eventually a few of his 'friends' decided to take him
up on the offer - but it would cost him 1,000 Gold Pieces, as
the victim would be hard to get close to.
Carnuss, in his youthful stupidity, agreed - but the 'assassins'
went straight to Sukumvit and told him of the plot, for they
were members of the palace guard whom the Baron had hired
to watch over his foolish brother. Carnuss's plottings were
publicly exposed, and the young nobleman fled the city in
disgrace. He travelled far and wide, but found that as soon
as he mentioned his name people would laugh at him.
Heading further and further south, he eventually went to live
on Blood Island off the desert coast of southern Allansia,
where he built a massive castle.
As the years in exile and isolation went by, Lord Carnuss's
hatred for his brother festered, until it turned him quite
insane. Sukumvit, meanwhile, was enjoying a long and
peaceful reign over Fang, where he was quite well liked by
his citizens, despite a tendency towards violence. As a sadistic
private hobby, he built Deathtrap Dungeon, a massive
underground complex full of deadly creatures and fiendish
traps. He offered a prize of 10,000 Gold Pieces to the warrior
who could pass through it. When one finally did, Sukumvit's
reputation suffered greatly, but he was undeterred, and
immediately made plans for a few changes. When he had
finally redesigned and rebuilt his 'Trial of Champions', as he
called it, he sent messengers to every town and village for
tens of leagues around, declaring that no one would ever pass
through it alive!
Carnuss, brooding in his distant castle, suddenly saw a way
of getting even with Sukumvit after all these years. He would
find a champion, a warrior and adventurer tough enough to
survive all that the Baron's feeble dungeon could throw at
him. To this end, he set up the Arena of Death on Blood
Island, which is still in use. He uses slaves obtained for him
by the notorious pirate and mass murderer Captain 'Skully'
Bartella; these slaves are often just normal people who have
been 'persuaded' to join the good captain and his scurvy crew
on a little sea-cruise. Once they are on the island, Carnuss
subjects his trainees to mortal combat in the arena. He is
trying to whittle them down to just a single warrior, who will
represent him and win the Trial of Champions, but his tests
are far too strenuous. When one does survive, however, he
plans to send him or her north, to revenge himself on his
sadistic brother.
