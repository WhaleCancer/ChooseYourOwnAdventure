SORCERER-KINGS 
AND 
WITCH-
QUEENS — THE SHAERN KERITHRION
The highest of all Dark Elves are the clan leaders, and the
highest of all clan leaders are those of Clan Kerithrion, who
govern the city as its royal family and reside in Aifi Lindale
Kerithrion, the Palace of Kerithrion, at the heart of the dark
city. The Clan Kerithrion is headed by a council of five, the
Shaern Kerithrion, who rule partly by common consent, and
partly by playing the other members of the circle against one
another.
King Eilden Kerithrion. He is the nominal leader of the Clan
Kerithrion, and therefore king of Tiranduil Kelthas and ruler
of the Dark Elf race. In truth, he is getting very old and weak,
and retiring into a paranoid world where everyone around
him is a threat to his rule. He trusts no one any more, least of
all his sister Velicoma, and he leaves his chambers in Aiu
Lindale Kerithrion only to attend the most important council
meetings. He is an acolyte of the Demon Prince Myurr, whom
he contacted by offering up his mother in living sacrifice
several centuries previously. Myurr has told him that the
throne of Kerithrion is threatened by the flaw of insanity, and
Eilden is now waiting for madness to show itself in one of the
other four rulers – not realizing that it is he who is the flaw.
Princess Velicoma Endal Kerithrion. Unlike her brother,
whom she plans to kill any day now, Velicoma is in full
command of her faculties, and has no illusions about any of
the other four. She is the High Priestess of Darkside, and
officiates at all important sacrifices. She too serves the Demon
Prince Myurr, and it was she who first suggested that they
exploit the paranoid side of King Eilden's character. Princess
Velicoma is a ruthless, emotionless witch, and most Dark
Elves feel afraid of her, without quite knowing why. She
appears to be cold and icy, but very efficient and practical,
and she deals harshly with foolishness. Around her there is
an almost tangible aura of threat, due partly to confident
arrogance and partly to pure evil. Should she ever come to
power, everyone hopes they will not be the ones she makes
examples out of.
Prince Astrea and Princess Leya Garathrim. Astrea and Leya are
cousins of the king and his evil sister, and they act as a
balancing force in the council. They are calm and intelligent,
and have little time for Eilden's paranoia and Velicoma's
schemings. They are worshippers of Ar Anwar Gerithan
(Slangg), but somehow manage to offset his evil teachings
with a careful concern for the proper workings of Dark Elf
society. If Eilden and Velicoma get caught in a power-struggle
against each other, they will be able to take control of
Tiranduil Kelthas with the minimum of fuss, for Leya is the
wife of Prince Taragul Camcarneyar, head of the Clan
Camcarneyar.
Prince Menel Ithilkir. The hothead of the Shaern Kerithrion,
Menel spends much of his time on surface raids with
members of the Clan Camcarneyar and rarely has any time
for the workings of Darkside politics. This is a great pity, for
he is usually on the same side as the Garathrim, and could
help them swing the power of the council towards a lighter,
more workable base. As it is, he only attends council meetings
when important military actions are being considered, or
when an especially bloody sacrifice of a captured Wood Elf
nobleman is due to be part of the entertainment. In truth, he
is only a member of the Shaern Kerithrion because he is head
of the Ithilkir branch of the clan, following the recent death
of his much stronger mother at the hands of a nameless
poisoner; this is widely suspected to be another of Velicoma's
little plots, but was in fact the work of Astrea and Leya.
The five members of the Shaern Kerithrion live in separate
parts of the palace, each protected by armed guards and
strong magic 'just in case'. If they were ever to unite, the Dark
Elves would finally be organized enough to look beyond
surviving day to day. They would be able to make plans for
a return to the surface world, to face the accursed Wood Elves
in full battle at last, and to show them the true meaning of
vengeance!
