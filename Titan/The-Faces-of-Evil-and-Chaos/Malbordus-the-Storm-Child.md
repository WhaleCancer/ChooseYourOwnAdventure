# Malbordus, the Storm Child

**Source:** CB77003 - Titan

There are many dangerous and Chaotic races on Titan,
working for the complete overthrow of civilization with the
supernatural help of awesome evil powers. But above all
stands one race, as the most evil, most depraved, most
decadent and most dangerous of all –mankind. For just as
man has the capacity for great good, he also has it in him to
do great evil, if he so desires.
In the years leading up to the cataclysmic War of the Wizards,
the human race was split down the middle, with one side
clearly opposed to the other, and with no room for neutral
bystanders. Today, 280 years after the collapse, humanity is
still struggling to reassert itself, but already there are men
who have followed the path of Evil to its extremes. Indeed,
there are far too many to detail here; all we can do is
concentrate on those who are perhaps the most important,
and shake our heads in despair for the many we have had to
omit.
Razaak, the Undying One
One hundred years ago, Razaak was an apprentice to one of
the Lawful wizards of that era. His master's name is
surprisingly not recorded, but he could quite easily have been
the Grand Wizard of Yore himself, Vermithrax Moonchaser.
He was quite a promising pupil, as apprentices go, though
like many he tried to run before he could walk. He was
fascinated by what his master told him of the dark magic of
shamans, Dark Elves and Demons. Peering through the
ancient books in his master's study by the light of a flickering
candle while the old man slept, Razaak quickly realized that
he had the inner strength to become a powerful necromancer,
who would one day be able to command everyone to obey
him. Magic was too precious a tool to waste on doing good –
he would use it to bring Allansia to its knees.
That very night, Razaak slipped back to his narrow bunk,
packed all his worldly goods into a small sack, and left the
way of Goodness for ever. He travelled to the remote wastes
at the far side of the Flatlands, where he meditated and
studied and practised the arcane arts in complete solitude for
forty years, until he knew that his powers had become so
great that he was a necromancer, capable of bringing the dead
back to life to be his slaves! He felt confident, at last, that
Allansia would soon be his.
Razaak sent messages to all the nobles of the land, demanding
that they acknowledge him as their ultimate ruler. But they
had never heard of him, and they ignored his threats as the
work of just another lunatic sorcerer. Razaak's response came
in the form of thousands of black insects, who brought plague
and pestilence to all lands. He sent another message to all the
rulers, this time with a deadline: they had until the next full
moon to acknowledge his leadership, or things would get
even worse.  Many warriors were dispatched to slay Razaak,
but all died in the attempt.
At last the warrior named simply Kull arrived. He owned a
sword which he had found gripped in a skeletal hand
projecting out of a mist-veiled lake, high up in the Moonstone
Hills, which he was crossing on his raft. It was an enchanted
blade, able to cut through the thickest plate-mail without its
razor-sharp edge being dulled or notched. The sword had
once belonged to Razaak himself, and was the one sword in
all of Titan which could harm him! As part of his final pact
with the demonic deities who accepted him into their ranks
as a necromancer, Razaak had to discard all weapons save
only for the sacrificial knives which he consecrated to Evil as
part of his initiation. But there was no way of destroying his
sword, so he threw it into the lake – from where it rose in the
hands of the skeleton! An incredible twist of fate worthy of
Logaan the Trickster himself brought the blade back to
Razaak in the hands of the now invincible Kull.
But as the blade bit home, Razaak cast his curse upon the
warrior. Kull's skin fell from his bones as dust around his feet,
and he was transformed into a skeleton, who would wield
the sword for ever! The mindless thing that was once Kull
returned to the lake where he first found that blessed and
accursed sword, and now sails back and forth, awaiting
someone to take it from him and release him into death's
sleep. Razaak's corpse was sealed in a stone sarcophagus,
which was then placed in a deep fissure high in the hills, and
the evil necromancer was forgotten. In recent months,
however, reports have come through Trolltooth Pass of
famine, pestilence and plague drifting across the Flatlands.
The sky has become dark and menacing, the sun hidden
behind a wall of grey. The source of the Evil has been
pinpointed as a fissure in the mountains, blackened by fire
and tainted with Chaos . . . could Razaak have been disturbed
and returned to the Earthly Plane?

Malbordus, the Storm Child
Malbordus is a human sorcerer, a powerful servant of Evil
and Chaos whose time is only now beginning to dawn. His
name means 'Child of Darkness' in Low Elvish, and it was
given to him when he was nine by the Wood Elves of
Darkwood Forest. To see the reasons for such a name, we
must go all the way back to his birth.
Malbordus was born in a battered, ramshackle hut on the
edge of Darkwood Forest in old Allansia, in the middle of the
wildest winter for several hundred years. Who his mother
was, no one knows, but it is thought she was just a simple
peasant crofter. She certainly could not cope with another
child, for the infant was abandoned in a snow-drift about half
a league into the forest.
That night, black-cowled Dark Elves from Tiranduil Kelthas,
the accursed city of Darkside hidden far beneath the surface
of the world, were abroad in the forest, worshipping the full
moon, Tiriel, with blood-sacrifices and bizarre rituals. One
party, flitting quietly across the snow without leaving any
trace, heard the child's cries. They found a pathetic, frozen
bundle, a human child which screamed at the top of its voice.
They took it to their ritual site, and offered him to the Silent
Guardian in the sky for his blessing. He was a gift from the
heavens, and was to be under Tiriel's protection for ever. After
the ritual was done, the Dark Elves slipped away and
returned underground to their city.
THE STORM CHILD
They named the child Aeren Tintathel, Storm Child, and
reared him in their temple under the protection of the
witch-queen Velicoma Kerithrion. As he grew, he was
introduced by her to the ways of Myurr, the Demon Prince,
and taught the ways of the Dark Elves as if he were one of
them. His pale white face and his piercing blue eyes were
very strange to the black-skinned Dark Elves. And the raw
power of his human soul did not take long to assert itself.
By the time MI-en was seven years old, he was indis-
tinguishable from young Dark Elf children in every way
except physically; his skin, which seemed to get whiter as he
grew older, marked him out as something special. But unlike
the other children, he carried within him an intensity of
purpose which was frightening to those to whom he chose to
reveal it. He spoke, with deep feelings of hatred and anger,
of the surface-dwellers who had left him to die in the snow
all those years ago, and talked of a time when he would
remind them of their so-called humanity. Such talk had never
been heard in the mouth of such a small child before, and
Princess Velicoma declared him to be a gift from the gods
(though the gods she meant are very different to our own).
A year later, the child's intensity had developed a stage
further, and began manifesting itself in spontaneous displays
of wild magic. He could snap his fingers and cause plants to
wither and die from sheer hatred. He would gaze deep into
the eyes of a Giant Lizard ten times his size, or a wild Elven
hound that he found in the street, and the dumb beast would
vacantly follow him wherever he went until it died from
starvation because the child had forgotten to command it to
eat. Aêren was plainly destined to be a great wielder of the
ancient magics.
THE FIRST TEST OF MAGIC
Elven magic is pure and graceful, full of the unstoppable
power of nature itself. But Dark Elven magic is vile and
degrading, a force of darkness which is so pure that it puts
the cheap darkness of the night to shame. To be initiated into
the very first stage of its arcane intricacies, a Dark Elf must
prove himself or herself worthy by some test; a second test
will then follow much later, and will herald the completion
of his or her learning. Most Dark Elves take the initial test
after half a century's study and worship, but the Storm Child
was just turning nine years old when he was proposed for
initiation. For the young Aëren, the test was one of his own
devising. He would go back to the surface world, where he
had not set foot since he was found in the snow on that terrible
winter's night exactly nine years before, and start the first
stage of his revenge.
And so, on a squally winter's evening, a small, black-robed
shape skipped lightly from the hidden entrance of the caves
which lead down into Tiranduil Kelthas, and disappeared
into the shadows of the forest. He did not know where he was
going, nor what he was going to do to prove his worthiness,
but he knew that the nameless beings which he had felt
watching over him for so long would protect him on this
night.
Luck, if that is what it was, was with him that night, for he
came, very soon, to an area of thick, tall trees, where the scent
was strongest. His Dark Elven night-vision picked out the
shape of tree-houses, far above the ground. The faint sound
