The Demonic Three
Years ago, an aged sorcerer had three pupils, whom he taught
in a secluded school of magic. Unlike the Grand Wizard of
the Forest of Yore, however, he was a servant of Evil and
Chaos, and his three pupils were being trained to be warlocks
and necromancers. The coven of this evil wizard, whose given
name was Volgera Darkstorm, was hidden among the grassy
wastes of the Flatlands, near one of the many ancient circles
of standing stones which litter the plains. There the four of
them studied all the arcane arts, from sticking pins in voodoo
dolls and simple spells for souring milk, to raising the dead
and communing with Demons.
The three young apprentices were keen students, and they
learnt their horrendous craft quickly, their capacity for evil
surprising even the depraved old sorcerer who taught them.
They would slip off in the evenings, long after their teacher
had retired to his bed, and just for fun sneak up on the camps
of horse-nomads under the cover of dark magic which would
hide their smell from the sensitive horses. There, in the
darkness, they would carefully set magical traps, which
would later explode into flame, when from the safety of a
clump of spiky bushes the three could watch the nomads
desperately rush about, trying to beat out their flaming tents.
These three were named Balthus, Zagor and Zharradan, and
their activities were soon to become known across much of
Allansia. When they reached the age of seventeen, the trio
decided they had had enough of learning, and enough of
living out on the Flatlands. They killed their teacher by magic,
left him lying in a pool of blood, and sneaked through
Trolltooth Pass and into old Allansia. There, in the shadows
of Dark-wood Forest, they said goodbye, wishing one another
the luck of the Dark Lords in serving their aims in the years
to come.
Balthus headed south, carefully avoiding the Forest of Yore.
The sweet scent of Goodness hung over forest, making the
young sorcerer feel sick, but it was quickly past. He did not
turn aside when he reached the foothills of the Craggen
Heights, but continued trekking into them, walking until he
could not progress any higher. There, on the bare
mountainside, he slept, but early the next day he reached his
goal – the citadel built by his grandfather and now inhabited
by his father, both of whom were themselves practitioners of
dark magic. Even as his father embraced him, welcoming him
back, Balthus slipped a poisoned dagger between his ribs –
and the Citadel of Chaos was his! He knew what he had to
do. He would gather around him servants of Chaos, Orcs and
Goblins – and he would make his own servants too, building
them out of other creatures to give him the strongest armies
in the land. He would show Zagor and Zharradan how evil
he could be!
Zagor, meanwhile, headed north with Zharradan for a while,
skirting Darkwood Forest, before the other broke off and
headed east into the Moonstone Hills. Zagor travelled for
many days, until he came in sight of Firetop Mountain, a peak
he had seen in his Demon-sent dreams many a time. Here, he
knew, his destiny lay. At that time the legendary caverns
underneath the mountain were occupied by Dwarfs, but that
soon changed, as the evil Zagor marched in with a strong
force of Orcs and foul undead creatures. Some of the Dwarfs
fled into the endless maze-like passages and were never
caught, but many were killed, providing yet more deathless
troops for the necromancer.
Now, many years later, Zagor is lord and master over Firetop
Mountain, where he rules over a motley collection of evil
servants, guarding the fabulous treasures he stole from the
Dwarfs all those years ago. At the other end of settled
Allansia, the foul Balthus Dire rules over the Black Tower, a
ghastly citadel which perches atop Craggen Rock like an
angry finger pointing accusingly at the gods! Within its
labyrinthine warrens, mutant creatures – spawned by Balthus
in his own laboratories – train in the use of weapons and
magic alongside Black Elves and many Orcs and Goblins.
They are preparing for war, for their satanic leader plans to
use them to invade the Vale of Willow and the ancient city of
Salamonis, bringing Chaos and death to that pleasant land as
a tribute to Dire's hell-spawned deities.
But what of Zharradan? Well, it is known that he headed east
into the Moonstone Hills all those years ago. We can trace his
path very well by the little clues he left behind him along the
way – a burning Elven village here, a massacred Woodling
settlement there and so on. When he came to the heart of the
Moonstones, however, he seemed to disappear without
leaving any trace. To say he is dangerous is an
understatement – if he is alive. It is just conceivable that he
has succumbed to the dangers of the world: let us hope
so.
