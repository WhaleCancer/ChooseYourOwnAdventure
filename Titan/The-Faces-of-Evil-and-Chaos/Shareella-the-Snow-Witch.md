# Shareella, the Snow Witch

of laughter floated down to him on the wind, and he knew
then that this was the place where his revenge began. Quite
by chance the young child had stumbled into the middle of
the Wood Elf town of Caêranos, completely bypassing the
patrolling guards.
Summoning all the inner strength he could muster, Aêren
began to think of fire. Small tongues of warmth, great
towering flames, wood glowing with heat, the stench of
burning flesh – Aêren thought it all. And the power began to
form inside him; all the hate and anger and Evil in him flowed
through his mind, where it was converted into thoughts of
fire, fire, fire. The first tree caught, bursting aflame in a
brilliant flash of light which blinded the small child. But he
went on concentrating, letting the real fire feed the flames
coursing through his mind. A second tree took, then a third
and a fourth. And soon every tree, for as far as Aèren could
see, was ablaze, and from the tops of trees, figures leapt to
their deaths, their clothes alight with the flames of Aêren's
Evil.
The entire tree-top town of Caéranos was alight now, with
Wood Elves scurrying everywhere in vain attempts to
organize the extinguishing of the fire. But it was already too
late – too late for water and too late even for magic. As they
ran round in panic, several Elves knocked into the little
human child who stood, wrapped in his cloak, staring up at
the flames with wide eyes and a happy smile on his face. But
they were too busy to take much notice of him then, for their
lives were crashing down around their ears.
It  was  not  until   much,   much   later,  when  the  Elves  were
counting the dead and asking how this could have happened,
that the child was remembered. And they asked themselves
who he was, this sweet-faced child who had appeared out of
nowhere to watch their families and friends die. The Elves
looked around for some clue, and they found a small black
cloak lying in the ashes of the largest tree. It was made of a
strange cloth, and it reeked of a musty smell, as if it had been
buried in the earth for a long time, which made the Elves feel
nauseous. The Elf who tried to pick it up let out a yelp, for it
burned his hand with the intense cold of pure Evil. And then
they knew that it was a Dark Elf cloak, and that the
mysterious human child was in league with the Dark Elves
of accursed Tiranduil Kelthas.
The story of the child who razed the Elf town spread quickly
to all parts of the Elf nation, and he was given the name
Malbordus, Child of Darkness, and his stature grew and grew
in the telling. But far beneath the surface of Darkwood Forest,
young Aêren, or Malbordus as even he would soon call
himself, was settling down to study the rudiments of the first
stage of Dark Elven magic. Since that solitary explosion of his
powers, he has not set foot in the outside world again, and
his name has been forgotten by all but a few.
But he must be approaching manhood soon, the time when
he will have to take his second test of initiation, to allow him
to finish his studies of the forbidden lore of Dark Elven magic.
And this time he will not be satisfied with burning down a
few trees. The next time Malbordus sets foot above ground,
all Allansia will know of it.
