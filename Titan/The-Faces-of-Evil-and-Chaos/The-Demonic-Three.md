# The Demonic Three

Shareella, the Snow Witch
In the far frozen north of Allansia, the Icefinger Mountains
loom over the ice-bound plains, their craggy peaks pointing
accusingly at the sky. In the mountains live wild creatures
such as Yeti and Toa-Suo, which prey on the smaller animals
of their icy habitat. But in recent years the Icefinger Mountains
have also been home to evil inhumans – Orcs, Goblins, Ogres
and Trolls – who make sporadic raids on isolated hunting
settlements in search of slaves. These foul beings serve the
evil sorceress known as the Snow Witch.
This demonic harridan makes her home in an extensive
network of carefully guarded caverns known as the Crystal
Caves. These fabulous caves were cut from the ice of a glacier
high up a mountainside many years ago by the same
degenerate creatures which serve her still. What she is doing
here, in this frozen land, is not fully understood, but rumours
say that she is acclimatizing herself to the powers of ice magic,
training herself until she is ready to unleash the cold and
bring a new Ice Age to Titan, at which point she will take
control.
Until fairly recently, no one knew where the Snow Witch had
come from – one moment the mountains were quiet, the next
she had arrived, with her army of Orcs and Goblins. But
thanks to the indomitable spirit of Harlak Erlisson, an
adventurer from Frostholm, we know much more about her,
and can even begin to piece together the sorry life which led
her to this point. Harlak spent nine months as a slave in her
ice-bound caves, being forced to raid and kill human
settlements by a magical collar which was welded around his
neck, but which did not stop his mind observing and
remembering everything he saw. The hardy warrior escaped
after his collar was knocked off when he was caught in an
avalanche, which killed the other members of his raiding
party. He crossed the ice plains to Allansia and freedom, and
then to us to report what he had seen and learnt.
The Snow Witch was once human. As a young woman in
Zengis, where she was born and grew up, she was known as
Shareella. In that far city, women have many important
religious and social roles, while the men become soldiers or
traders. It seems they believe that women are far more
'spiritual' creatures than the more physical men. However, to
reconcile this fact, a sorceress had to wander the barren
northern wilderness as a test of her survival skills and
will-power. Young Shareella was trained as a sorceress, and
for her test was sent to the fringes of the Icefinger Mountains
in winter, where she would have to live – without the benefit
of fire or shelter or any other comforts – for five weeks.
At first Shareella found the going very hard, for she was used
to the warmer climate of more southerly Zengis. But by the
end of the second week she was beginning to become
acclimatized to the conditions, and started to explore her
surroundings. Gradually she wandered higher and higher
into the Icefingers, living off snow-deer she caught and killed
with her bare hands, but cooked with magical fire. Four weeks
into her test, Shareella was exploring, as usual, when she
came to a secluded ravine-cum-valley which she had not seen
before. She gazed down into it – and stopped in her tracks!
At the far end of the depression was a gigantic statue of a
Demon, apparently carved out of solid ice.
But when she approached it, and laid her palm on its
surprisingly warm surface, a voice spoke in her head –the
voice of the Ice Demon which rested inside the statue. It told
her many things about Demons and their works, and about
the 'perversions' of Goodness and the 'blasphemies' of
Neutrality. And it showed her a vision of the world covered
in ice, and her as its omnipotent ruler! Shareella was
converted in an instant, and pledged her soul to do everything
she could to attain that goal.
Under the tuition of the Ice Demon, she became a
necromancer, able to raise up zombies or skeletons from the
bodies of the dead to serve her. She was provided with hordes
of Orcs and Goblins, who worship the Demon, to build her
the Crystal Caverns, where she now resides, hidden within
the mountainside by an illusory wall of ice. In their turn, the
inhuman races brought her slaves, whom she keeps in order
with special magical collars that deliver sharp jolts of pain
any time she wishes. Shareella has become twisted by the
powers given to her by the Demon, and now she is a Vampire,
able to suck the souls from other people's bodies. But all the
time she is studying the powers of the ice, and readying
herself for the day when the glaciers will creak and then
slowly set off to cover all of Titan.
