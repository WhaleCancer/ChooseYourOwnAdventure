## Overview

For hundreds, maybe thousands of years, tales have been told of the peoples who dwell 'under the sea'. The most persistent spreaders of such tales have been sailors, of course, who are renowned in all lands for being the biggest liars and exaggerators around! Put a salty old seaman in a run-down dockside tavern, stick a mug of rum in his tattooed hand to go with the dozens he has already quaffed, and he will give you a tale of such monumental catastrophe you will never contemplate going aboard a ship again! Such tales usually revolve around either gigantic sea-monsters which threaten to smash a galley into smithereens with one flick of a tail which has the dimensions of a city wall, or perilously beautiful Mermaids who perch seductively on stray rocks or the backs of passing dolphins and call love-struck look-outs to their doom.

Like most tales, those told of the underwater world are a mixture of half-truths and plain exaggeration. There are sea-monsters, and there are Mermaids, though they may not fit the descriptions you have heard. Moreover, they are far from being the only occupants of the world beneath the waves. Several races live in the oceans of Titan, though how they got there is anyone's guess. Some tell it like this...

## The Legend of Hydana

During the age of the earth before Time had been released by Death, and when the shape of the land was very different to what it is today, Hydana (the name the people of the Old World give the god of the waters) lived alone in a great palace at the bottom of the ocean. He was utterly captivated by the beauty of the sea and all the creatures which dwelt in it, and spent his time swimming in the depths observing all its wonders. But in time he became bored, for few of his brothers and sisters visited him (being too busy, for the most part, in fighting one another) and he wished for more sophisticated pleasures than merely playing with a few fish. Hydana had heard that his fellow gods had started to create their own beings, strange creatures which walked on two legs and had intelligence of sorts, and soon he saw some 'men', when they took their first tentative steps into the waters of their planet to swim and fish.

Hydana saw his chance. He captured a boat full of 'men' and 'women', and drew them beneath the waves to observe them; but he was dismayed to find that they wriggled a while, but then lay still, and would not move again, no matter how hard he shook them. He tried this several times, before it dawned on him that the bubbles the things released when held underwater were what they breathed to keep alive on the land. Next time he captured a boat, therefore, he changed the lungs of his 'guests' into gills, so that they could join him in his wondrous world beneath the sea. At first, of course, the humans were terrified, but Hydana continued adding to their numbers, and in time they began to enjoy their new life under the waves with Hydana, and built their own towns and cities, and farmed seaweed and other crops. The god continued adding to his stock of 'little people', and soon had brought other beings such as Elves, Trolls and Giants to join the humans.

## The First Battle and Aftermath

Hydana, however, was caught up in the First Battle against Death and his cohorts. During the battle he was so sorely injured that he retired to the deepest part of the oceans, from where he rarely emerges now, except at times of great disaster, or when called upon by his fellow gods for some special task – like the drowning of Atlantis, which we will come to in a moment.

## The Underwater Races

The underwater races prospered in the oceans, and lived in small groups dotted around the ocean beds. They made their homes in caves at first, but soon began to build from stone, learning the techniques by examining drowned villages near the coast which had been submerged by the sea's relentless advance. Over the centuries they have developed their own unique culture and way of life, adapted to the depths of the ocean.

These races include the Mermaids and Mermen, who are perhaps the most well-known of the underwater peoples to surface dwellers. There are also other races that have adapted to life beneath the waves, each with their own customs, cities, and ways of interacting with the world above.

## Conclusion

The Children of Hydana continue to thrive in the depths of Titan's oceans, living in their underwater cities and maintaining their own civilization far from the eyes of surface dwellers. While sailors' tales may exaggerate their nature, there is no doubt that these underwater races are real, and that they play an important role in the world of Titan, even if most surface dwellers know little of their existence.
