## Overview

Such is the general situation beneath the waters of this world's oceans, but what of Atlantis, that infamous city of legend? Ever since people have been telling tales, there have been legends about the city which was deliberately drowned by the gods, and the stories are not restricted to coastal regions – even the primitive peoples of the Scythera Desert and the Desert of Skulls have tales of 'a city over running land [water] buried by the gods'. The story of Atlantis and its cataclysmic destruction has passed around the whole world.

## The Island of Atlantis

Once there was a large island in the centre of what is now called the Western Ocean. In those days, this stretch of water was much larger, for the three main landmasses we know today were joined where the Ocean of Serpents and the Ocean of Tempests now flow. The gods had departed from the Earthly Plane by this time, but the races of man had started their rise towards civilization. The island was known as Atlantis, after Atlan, the messenger of the gods, and it was the greatest centre for wisdom on the whole of Titan. In its capital, Atlantis City, the wisest scholars of the day would gather to discuss deep philosophical questions about the nature of life.

## The Wealth and Power of Atlantis

Atlantis was very rich, for in the mountains which made up perhaps half its area the Atlanteans had found gold in abundant and seemingly inexhaustible supply. With this gold, the people of Atlantis bought the finest goods the world could offer and lived in extreme luxury in Atlantis City, which was without doubt the most beautiful metropolis ever to have graced the surface of Titan. The wealth of the Atlanteans attracted the attentions of many poorer nations, and invasions were attempted at a rate of perhaps two or three a decade.

However, the Atlanteans had not only wealth but also wisdom, and they had developed powerful magical defences which protected their island from all but the most determined of attackers. Their scholars had discovered many secrets of the universe, and their magical prowess was unmatched anywhere else on Titan.

## The Fall of Atlantis

But the very things that made Atlantis great – its wealth, its power, and its knowledge – also led to its downfall. The Atlanteans grew arrogant and began to believe that they were the equals of the gods themselves. They started to experiment with magic that was forbidden, seeking to control forces that should have remained beyond mortal reach.

The gods, seeing the hubris of the Atlanteans and the danger they posed to the balance of the world, decided that Atlantis must be destroyed. Hydana, the god of the waters, was called upon to perform this terrible task. He raised the seas around the island, and in a single cataclysmic event, Atlantis was swallowed by the ocean, its people, its cities, and all its treasures lost beneath the waves.

## The Sunken City Today

Today, the ruins of Atlantis lie at the bottom of the Western Ocean, a testament to the folly of mortals who would challenge the gods. The city itself is said to be remarkably well-preserved, protected by the magic that once defended it, though now it serves only to keep the ruins intact. Many adventurers and treasure-seekers have attempted to reach the sunken city, drawn by tales of its vast wealth and lost knowledge, but few have succeeded, and fewer still have returned to tell the tale.

The waters around Atlantis are treacherous, filled with strange currents, dangerous sea creatures, and remnants of the magical defences that once protected the island. Some say that the spirits of the Atlanteans still haunt the ruins, guarding their lost treasures and knowledge from those who would plunder them.

## Conclusion

The legend of Atlantis serves as a warning to all who would seek too much power or knowledge. The city that was once the greatest centre of learning and wealth in all of Titan now lies at the bottom of the ocean, a reminder that even the mightiest of civilizations can fall when they forget their place in the world.
