## Overview

For many centuries the knowledge that the many different creatures which roam the surface of Titan worshipped deities was conveniently forgotten. The animals, priests argued, were ignorant of the beauty of the gods and goddesses, and lived their lives completely unaware that there was more to existence than simply swimming about in the sea, soaring on thermals high above the land, or stalking the plains in search of prey. Such a view also 'proved', quite conclusively, that animals did not have souls, and therefore man was supreme, greater than any beast! The traditional response to such a pompous argument may well have been 'Man's not an animal? You haven't seen my husband!', but it blinded many cultures to the gods of the Animal Court.

## The Nature of True Neutral

Animals and their gods follow an alignment which is rather difficult to categorize, but which is sometimes known as 'True Neutral', which is why we are including a few details of it at this juncture. It is a blind belief, and an unintelligent one, for it seeks only to help the race of the particular animal, and disregards what happens to other beings. Every creature on Titan was made by a god during the Godtime, when the world was filled with the creations they made from the magic clay found by Throff in her garden. These gods did not simply disappear; they became the gods of the animals, and sit at the Animal Court, where they are indifferent to anything but the continued survival of their own species, no matter what the cost to Law or Chaos across the cosmos.

## The Exploitation of Animal Gods

This attitude has been exploited on a few occasions, where creatures such as wolves and spiders have been persuaded to serve the Forces of Evil, not because they are inherently evil themselves, but because they have been promised that their species will be protected and allowed to flourish. The gods of the Animal Court care nothing for the grand struggle between Good and Evil; they care only for the survival and prosperity of their own kind.

## The Animal Gods

Each species of animal has its own god or goddess who watches over it from the Animal Court. These deities are ancient, dating back to the Godtime when the world was first created. They are not concerned with the moral alignments of Law or Chaos, but only with the welfare of their particular species. A wolf god, for example, cares only that wolves survive and thrive; it matters not to them whether the wolves serve Good or Evil, so long as the pack survives.

## Conclusion

The Animal Court represents a different kind of neutrality from that of the Tricksters. Where the Tricksters seek to balance Good and Evil, the Animal Court is simply indifferent to such concerns. Their only interest is in the survival of their own species, and they will align with whichever side serves that purpose, or with neither side if that is what best serves their creatures. This makes them unpredictable allies or enemies, for their motivations are entirely different from those of the other forces in the world of Titan.
