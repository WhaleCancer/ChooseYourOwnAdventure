## Overview

Between the [Forces of Good](../The-Forces-of-Good/The-Gods-of-Good.md), which are few in number but determined of purpose, and the [Forces of Evil and Chaos](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/The-Dark-Lords-of-Chaos.md), which are numerous but disorganized, there are the Neutral Forces. Well, they cannot really be termed Forces as such, for they have no real armies, and often prefer to use those of other people to do their work for them, if they wish it done at all, that is. For there are, in fact, two types of Neutral; the people you encounter may be one or the other. They may be followers of the Trickster gods, led by [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md), the creator of man, who try to offset Good and Evil against each other, eventually to balance the two. Alternatively, they may have opted out of allegiance to either side, and prefer to remain aloof from the world and all its problems. This second type have no gods, no allies and few philosophies; they have simply turned their backs on the world. Both factions may give you great help, or may hinder you terribly, almost according to their whims; as a result, you should be very wary of Neutral beings.

## The Philosophy of Balance

The basic philosophy of the Tricksters and their followers is simple, but it operates on a grand cosmic scale that is hard to grasp. Whatever happens, they say, the universe will survive only if the powers which pull it this way and that are balanced: too great a shift one way or the other will tear the fabric of the cosmos and the world will end. Therefore, whenever one side is in a very strong position, the Tricksters will either lend their aid to the opposing factions and hinder the stronger side, or they will live very dangerously by pushing the stronger side to even better positions, in the hope that the underdog will fight back and restore the balance. For all their apparently frivolous tricks and jokes, the followers of luck and chance are actually very serious followers of the balance of Good and Evil.

## Lord Logaan the Trickster

As you know, [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) the Trickster was one of the gods of the Celestial Court. Although different cultures call him by other names (which include Ranjan and Akolyra), and give him different forms (a woman or a mischievous cat seem to be the most common, though there are many others), all seem certain that it was he who first created intelligent beings when he made Man and Woman during the [Godtime](../History-and-Legend/In-the-Beginning.md). Such universality is surprising, for it occurs in few other areas of mythology; such instances are usually taken to mean that the event described by the myths definitely did not happen.

[Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) is a strange god, for he has no recognized parents or relations among the hierarchy of the Celestial Court, whereas even Death has his brothers, Disease and Decay. One might have at least expected Logaan to be related to Sindla, the goddess of luck, for their domains overlap, but this is not so. However, in the writings, statues and symbols of his devoted worshippers, he is joined by a pair of mysterious figures, known as Kata and Petros. These two are usually depicted as faceless, robed humans who stand flanking Logaan, pulling him this way and that – obviously symbolic of the way in which Logaan himself pulls the Forces of Good and Evil this way and that. Logaan is portrayed in many different guises, like all gods, but in his most common human form he is short and misshapen, like a clown, with bandy legs and a strange expression on his face. His hair is wild and his garments appear not to fit – but in his eyes there is always a look of extreme seriousness.

## Logaan in Folklore

The other gods of Titan appear only in very serious mythological tales, but [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) also crops up in many popular folk-tales. They are always set on the Earthly Plane, either just before or just after the other gods leave following the [First Battle](../History-and-Legend/The-War-of-the-Wizards.md), and they always seem to end up with him playing tricks on someone who has been pompous, cruel or foolish. Many of the tales also explain how the Trickster discovered writing, or fire, or the wheel, or smoking-weed, or whatever. And although Logaan is always the hero of the tale, he often makes himself appear foolish too.

## A Typical Folk-Tale: Logaan and the Troll

A typical folk-tale of this sort is Logaan and the Troll, which is a popular bedtime story told by farmers and woodsmen to their children in many different lands:

[Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) is wandering through the countryside when he comes to a village, where everyone is very sad. When he asks why, they tell him that a big, evil [Troll](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md) comes down into the village every night and carries some of them off to eat. The [Troll](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md) lives in a cave in the nearby hills, and the villagers are too afraid to do anything about it. [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md), seeing their plight, decides to help them, but in his own way.

He goes to the [Troll](../The-Forces-of-Evil-and-Chaos/Trolls-and-Ogres.md)'s cave and finds the creature sleeping. Instead of attacking it directly, Logaan plays a trick. He paints the Troll's face with bright colours while it sleeps, and when the Troll wakes up and sees its reflection in a pool of water, it thinks it has been transformed into something else and runs away in terror, never to return. The villagers are saved, but Logaan has already moved on, leaving them to wonder who their mysterious saviour was.

## The Serious Side of the Tricksters

Such folk-tales show up the frivolous side of the Tricksters, but there are more serious sides, as can sometimes be seen in the actions of their emissaries on the Earthly Plane. Those who serve the Tricksters can be deadly adversaries, for they work solely for the sake of balancing out Good and Evil – and if you are working for the side of Good when you encounter them, they may well react to you like servants of Evil!

## The Netherworld Sorcerers

The Netherworld Sorcerers of the Northlands of the [Old World](../The-World-of-Titan/The-Old-World.md) are servants of [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) and the other Tricksters; they are noted both for their great powers at high magic and for their seemingly arbitrary bestowal of gifts or curses. It was they, for example, who created the powerful Ting Ring, which they gave to the nobles of Gallantaria. The ring bestows all kinds of special abilities on its wearer, depending upon the circumstances. If it is worn in battle, for example, it will protect its wearer from the effects of blows; if worn while hunting, it will instil the ability to track game; it can protect you from the effects of foul undead creatures, or tell you that there is poison in your cup!

Such magical artefacts are typical Trickster items, changing from one thing to another, depending on what is wanted. The Ting Ring is also imbued with a typical Trickster joke: it has a chameleon-like power which causes it to blend in with its background, and several emergencies have been caused in Royal Lendle by noblemen who thought they had lost the ring!

But it was also the Netherworld Sorcerers who conjured up the accursed Demon Fish which threatened the coast of the Onyx Sea for some years. It was a gigantic creature, larger than a warship, and would tear apart vessels and swallow fishermen whole. The fish was finally caught by the hero who solved Tan-talon's tasks and became ruler of Gallantaria, but not before it had terrorized the coast and many fishermen had lost their lives. Why the Sorcerers inflicted such a beast on the coast we may never know.

We also know very little about the Sorcerers themselves. They are an ancient race, it is believed, who were dwelling in their remote towers in the Northlands for many centuries before man settled there; and they dwell there still. As to their numbers, or any further details about their life-styles, your guess is as good as anyone's, for they keep themselves hidden from the view of others. From their lofty homes, however, they obviously keep a vigilant watch over the whole of the western continent. When they see Evil or Good getting too much of an upper hand they interfere a little, to ensure that everything balances up in the end.

## The Riddling Reaver

The Riddling Reaver is another unusual servant of the Tricksters. Legend says that he dwells somewhere amid the jungles of southern [Allansia](../The-World-of-Titan/Allansia-Land-of-Danger.md), in a place where all the normal rules have been disregarded – where water no longer flows downwards, where trees seem not to need soil, but float free in the air, and so on. Wherever he actually has his residence, however, he is most often seen aboard his enormous ship, in which he sails around the world to carry out his tasks.

The Reaver is said to be a master of disguise, able to transform himself into just about anyone or anything in a matter of minutes; he often uses such disguises to get close to his 'victims'. He is also a very puzzling being, for he delights in leaving enigmatic rhymes behind him wherever he goes – hence his name. He seems to have almost limitless powers to draw on in his tasks of bringing confusion and balance to the world. Where he actually originates from is anyone's guess. He may be a human being blessed with peculiar powers by his equally peculiar gods, or he may be a supernatural being sent by the Tricksters to work special missions on the Earthly Plane, perhaps where a Genie – the usual Trickster emissary – would not be subtle enough.

## The Runes of the Tricksters

The Tricksters use two runes, which encapsulate the basic principles behind their alignment. One is an arrow pointing in both directions, symbolizing the balance of Good and Evil. The other is a star, which points in all directions - it means, quite simply, that absolutely anything can happen!

## Other Followers of the Tricksters

Few non-human races worship [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md) the Trickster as avidly as some humans do, but there are races who seem to follow him. The peculiar [Elvins](../../Creatures/Humanoids/Forces%20of%20Good/Elves/Elvin.md) of the Shamutanti Hills in Kakhabad (the small, Elf-like creatures, not the large sea monsters of the Inland Sea, which have the same name) certainly profess to worship the Trickster, who they see as a fun-loving god who likes nothing more than playing tricks on people all day. [Elvins](../../Creatures/Humanoids/Forces%20of%20Good/Elves/Elvin.md) have a large repertoire of tricks themselves, which they spend most of their time perfecting – at the expense of some other poor creature, naturally!

[Leprechauns](../../Creatures/Humanoids/Fairies/Leprechaun.md), too, follow the mischievous path of the Tricksters – indeed, some folk call them [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md)'s Children in honour of the fact that they are always playing practical jokes on people. Unlike Elvins, however, who only play tricks for amusement, Leprechauns use them to stay alive; they steal and cheat food or money out of their victims! Indeed, they can become quite violent if they badly need something from someone. This is not really true to the spirit of the Tricksters as such, however, and many now believe that the Leprechauns simply share many affinities with other servants of these gods, rather than being proper servants of them. It is true that [Logaan](Lord-Logaan-the-Trickster.md)'s tricks are often violent, but their purpose is rarely to steal or cheat others – except when to do so is part of the joke, that is.

## Conclusion

The Servants of the Tricksters are a unique and unpredictable force in the world of Titan. While they may seem chaotic and unreliable, their underlying purpose is to maintain the balance between Good and Evil, ensuring that neither side gains too much power. Those who encounter them should be prepared for unexpected twists of fate, for the Tricksters work in mysterious ways, and their help may come in forms that are not immediately recognizable.
