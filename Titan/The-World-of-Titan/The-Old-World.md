## Overview

The people of Allansia often wondered what lay across the Western Ocean, that vast rolling expanse of monster-infested water which stretched as far as the eye could see. Some said that the ocean just went on for ever, and a ship would sail until its crew died of starvation and thirst, without reaching land. Others said that you would travel for weeks and weeks, never sighting land, until you sailed over the waterfall at the end of the world! But some had heard legends which said that Allansia was once joined to two other continents, which were split apart by the gods for some terrible crime many, many centuries ago. They knew that out there somewhere was another land, though what it was like they could not imagine.

Eventually, however, brave mariners did make the crossing. Sailing due west for many weeks, with dolphins dancing around the prow and flying fish skimming by their side, they finally caught sight of land – and what a land! The first sailors from Allansia to visit the Old World, as its inhabitants called the landmass, landed near Arkleton, the capital of Analand, where they were received by the king. Scholars were eager to learn about the second continent, which they had long suspected to exist. The sailors travelled across the whole of the continent, being shown the full extent of the land they had 'discovered'. Moreover, when they came to Pollua in Lendleland, they met mariners from yet another continent, who had made the long and perilous voyage across the Ocean of Serpents from Khul. Eventually the sailors returned to Allansia, where they at once declared what they had discovered to scholars and anyone else who was interested.

Now merchants and adventurers make the crossing quite regularly, with perhaps two boats a year taking goods and travellers to the continent, which ironically they called the New World for a while, until its real name was known!

The Old World is a land of contrasting regions, from the lush grassy plains of Lendleland to the unscalable peaks of the Cloudcap Mountains in Mauristatia. Its people live mostly from the land, but it has many larger settlements as well, for it escaped the cataclysmic wars that have kept the other continents from attaining true civilization. Some of the kingdoms of the Old World have not reached their full development, but just about all of them are more sophisticated and civilized than anywhere in Allansia or Khul.

## Femphrey, Chalanna's Land

The most important land at the moment is Femphrey, a wealthy kingdom on the western coast of the continent. It is a flat, fertile country of grassy plains crossed by many rivers and sprinkled with small clumps of old woodland. Its people are ruddy, brown-skinned folk who always seem to be laughing and smiling with the joys of life, though this was not always the case. Many years ago, Femphrey was a poor and tawdry land, its soil moderately fertile but its people glum and unenthusiastic. Its decrepit capital Femnis, situated near the coast on the mouth of the Femnis River, was rapidly crumbling around the ears of the king and its poverty-stricken merchants.

But all this changed when King Chalanna found the artefact known as the Crown of Kings. This magical symbol of rulership made him wise and charismatic, and he quickly inspired his people into revitalizing their country. Within the space of just a few years Chalanna had worked wonders. The capital city was torn down before it could fall down, and a brand-new one was built in its place from the proceeds of the nation's new prosperity. Named Chalannabrad after its most famous resident, it is a wide, open city, with pleasant tree-lined avenues running between large, well-built houses and clean parks and public squares, and stands at the mouth of the renamed Chalanna River.

From its impressive docklands, ships sail out into the strange Eelsea, a mysterious place which takes its name from the Great Eels which live there, though it is also home to Serpents, Sea Dragons, the huge horned Bullwhales, the mythical Decapi (frightening, intelligent, ten-legged creatures found nowhere else on Titan), and worse. As they set out to travel up or down the coast, or merely to fish, every boat and ship ensures that there is a fully qualified naval sorcerer on board . . . just in case!

At the other end of the Chalanna River lies Crystal City, a wonderful place built entirely from crystals dredged from the intriguing Crystal Lake. Hot springs beneath the surface of the waters keep them very warm; sometimes, when the springs are very active, the water of the lake actually boils. The River of Fire which feeds the lake springs from the slopes of an active volcano high among the peaks of neighbouring Mauristatia, and brings strange minerals to the lake. These react with the steaming lake and form crystals which are mined by the people of Crystal City, and to a lesser extent by those of Rorutuna.

## Lendleland

The people of Lendleland are very jealous of those of Femphrey in many ways. Their mining operations in Crystal Lake are nothing like as successful as those of the Femphreyans. The capital city and chief port, Pollua, is small and run down, and the fishing grounds off its coast are not as rich as those of the Eelsea. Its people are poor and superstitious. Much of the land is infertile grassy plain, suitable only for breeding wild horses (which admittedly make the best mounts in the world). In the eastern hills, rebellious barbarians still make raids on the other country, to Lendleland's eternal shame.

Their dissatisfaction came to a head in a very petty dispute with Femphrey over who actually owned the Siltbed River, which flows out of Crystal Lake and marks the boundary of the two nations. After many years of squabbling, Chalanna the Reformer in his gracious wisdom granted Lendleland full rights to the river, and at the same time lent them the awesome Crown of Kings. This tremendous gesture of peace was heartily welcomed by Lendleland: there was even some talk of the two kingdoms merging under the joint rule of Chalanna himself. But in fact the river is a poor prize. It has a thick silty bed and is tidal, so that a great many boats and barges regularly line its banks waiting for the high tide to float them off again. Its waters are also filthy with minerals and waste from the Crystal Lake, and they are not fit to drink. When the Crown was passed on to Gallantaria after four years, the people began to see Chalanna as an opportunistic swindler, and the old squabbles started again.

## Analand and the Eastern Coast

At the far eastern end of the Anvils of the Gods, the land drops sharply down towards the country of Analand, where it is immediately blocked by the enormous Great Wall of Analand, built to check the raids of unruly barbarians from eastern Lendleland. It was a foolish gesture to attempt to build a wall around an entire kingdom, however, and the project was abandoned with several large sections missing, before the country bankrupted itself and the king was deposed! Today Analand is a pleasant land with hardworking and honest citizens. In the southern part, known as Far Analand, spices and strange plants are grown, before being carried and shipped all over the continent by merchants and ships from Gummport. Most of Analand's citizens live in the broad plain which runs north from Lake Libra. The lake is revered as a holy site of great importance, for it is said that the goddess of justice, patron goddess of Analand, once appeared to a sick man on the lakeside and cured him of his ills. The lake is now ringed with the monasteries of many religious groups; pilgrims travel to Libra from all over the land. At the far end of the fertile plain, on the banks of the Goldflow River, lies Arkleton, capital of Analand and home to its king. The river has its source in Goldwater Lake, which lies some way to the north. The lake is rich in metal ores, and fine particles of ore can actually be seen floating in suspension in the water! The town of Scarton on its shore recovers the gold and the other metals, and refines them into the ingots which give Analand much of its wealth.

## The Vermin-Pit: Kakhabad

Kakhabad is a wild land, populated by thieves and brigands, monsters and evil inhumans, and many other outcasts from the rest of the world. It is a land tainted by the touch of Chaos, which once festered here, and a place of wild magic and strange natural phenomena. At its centre lies Khare, known affectionately as the Cityport of Traps.

City it certainly is, though a more disreputable, scummy, violent, ramshackle excuse for a city you could not imagine. Port? Yes – despite being close on a hundred leagues from the stormy Kakhabad Sea, Khare is linked by the wide Jabaji River, which carries boats, barges and even large ships all the way from the sea to Khare itself, where they meet with other boats bringing fish downstream from Lake Lumle to the north. And the traps? Well, unfortunately, these also exist, in great numbers. They were introduced by some of the more Lawful citizens in an attempt at protection from the great many thieves and muggers who infest the city, but the plan backfired somewhat, for the Lawful citizens did not tell one another where their own traps were! Now everyone moves about carefully, sticking to parts of the city they know and avoiding strange streets and alleys.

Beyond Khare, there are the flat plains of the Baklands, strange barren wastes where Nature's processes are perverted and controlled by the powers of Chaos, which seem to emanate from the land itself! Peculiar plants dwell everywhere; streams bubble as they boil, or creak with slabs of floating ice; bizarre creatures wander its rocky wildernesses. You will need all your wits about you to cross such an unnatural place. Beyond the Baklands, the land rises sharply to High Xamen, where the demonic Archmage has his fortress. The heights are home to deadly aerial races such as Bird Men and Life-Stealers, but if you manage to cross them you will find yourself in Ruddlestone, the first of the northern kingdoms.

## The Lands of the Northern Plains

Ruddlestone is a small, rather peculiar place, where people of many different philosophies rub shoulders with one another. The main ruling faction is the religious one, which has a decidedly military bent to it, because of the continual wars with neighbouring Brice. It was these wars which forced the people of Ruddlestone to build the massive Demonkeep Outpost on the edge of the mountains, overlooking the main approach to Brice near the Dagga River which marks the border. It is permanent home to a garrison of a thousand warrior-priests. At the other end of the kingdom – and directly opposed to such warlike organization – there are the ports. Harabnab is peaceful enough, home to all Lawful adventurers and sailors; but just down the coast lies the Port of Crabs, haven to every pirate for fifty nautical miles, who prey constantly on the shipping of the coast. Ruddlestone is a strange land to combine such opposites!

Pirates also raid the coast from the distant City of Mazes in Brice. The kingdom of Brice is very warlike, perpetually disputing with surrounding lands the extents of its shifting borders. It does this, quite simply, because it has few natural resources of its own. Its dictatorial leaders keep the people occupied in always preparing for war, centring their activity around the capital, the Forbidden Fortress.

To Brice's west lies Gallantaria, once the most important land in all the Old World, and a land with a rich history. It has had a turbulent past (mostly because of the warlike ambitions of Brice and the inhabitants of the Northlands), but has gradually settled down a little. Its capital, Royal Lendle, is home to many sages, who spend much of their time sifting through the rich archives of the ruling family's libraries in search of more coherent information about the past of their continent. Gallantaria is generally a peaceful land of peasant farmers and more wealthy townsfolk, though disturbing things still lurk on its borders. The heights of the Witchtooth Line, which divide it from Femphrey, and the Cragrock Peaks, which mark the country's northern border, are home to all kinds of outlaws and strange sects, who may one day become strong enough to threaten Gallantaria itself.

## Conclusion

The Old World is a more settled and more civilized continent than either Allansia or Khul. But there are still many threats lurking in the wilder areas, and Kakhabad as a whole is as dangerous a place as you are likely to find anywhere on Titan. Do not think that a little civilization can hide the extreme peril of a land where Chaos once ruled and where it threatens to rule again!
