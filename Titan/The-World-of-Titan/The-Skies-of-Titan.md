## Overview

The skies above Titan are as varied and dangerous as the lands below. While most of the world's inhabitants travel by land or sea, there are those who have mastered the art of flight, and the skies themselves are home to many strange and wondrous creatures.

## Flying Creatures

The most noble of all flying creatures are the Giant Eagles, who make their homes in the highest peaks of the world's mountain ranges. These magnificent birds are intelligent and proud, and will only allow the most worthy of beings to ride upon their backs. They are particularly fond of Elves, who share their love of nature and the wild places of the world.

Other aerial races include the Bird Men, who dwell in the high places of the world, and the deadly Life-Stealers, who hunt from the skies above the most dangerous regions of Titan.

## Aerial Travel

For those who would travel through the skies, there are few options. The most reliable method is to befriend a Giant Eagle, though this is no easy task. Some wizards have mastered spells of flight, but such magic is rare and dangerous. There are also tales of flying ships and magical devices that can carry adventurers through the air, but these are the stuff of legend and are rarely encountered in the real world.

## The Dangers of the Sky

The skies of Titan are not safe for the unwary. In addition to the natural dangers of flight itself, there are many creatures that hunt from above. Life-Stealers, Bird Men, and other aerial predators make the skies as dangerous as any wilderness on the ground. Storms can arise without warning, and the higher one flies, the more exposed one becomes to the elements and to magical forces that might be at work in the upper atmosphere.

## Conclusion

While the skies offer a faster means of travel than land or sea, they are not for the faint of heart. Only the most skilled and courageous adventurers should attempt to master the art of flight, and even then, they must be prepared for the many dangers that await them in the air above Titan.
