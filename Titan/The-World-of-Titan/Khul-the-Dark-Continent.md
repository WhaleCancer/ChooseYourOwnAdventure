## Overview

Steer a ship out of Pollua in Lendleland, and head south-west by the light of the Dragon Star. Keep on until it vanishes below the horizon, at about the same time as the land behind you disappears, and you will find yourself sailing in unfamiliar seas under foreign stars. Stick true to your course, though whales and dolphins dance around your prow, and stranger creatures rear out of the water to see how edible you might be, before sinking with hardly a ripple, and in perhaps sixty days or so you will sight land again. A vast, mountainous coastline will grow nearer and nearer until it towers over your frail craft, with no sign of any inlet or bay to ease your journey. You must sail around the coastline for two or three more days before you will find somewhere to beach your craft and at last set foot on Khul.

When the world was still forming, many millennia before the first men set foot upon its surface, Khul and Allansia were joined by a narrow land-bridge, which later separated, as the two continents drifted apart, to create a string of islands. Over the centuries much has happened to the face of the world, and most of these islands have now sunk beneath the waves, allowing the ocean currents to grow stronger and stronger, and creating the all but impassable Ocean of Tempests which now separates Allansia from Khul. Many legends and improbable sailors' stories surround attempts to cross to Khul, including hair-raising tales of Sea Giants emerging from the water to 'play' with boats in scaly hands the size of archery fields, and of manta rays of even larger dimensions which skim along the surface of the water, swooping above it for short distances before gliding back into the water, their mouths wide open as they dredge for fish and other food – including unfortunate ships! Whatever the real truth behind such stories, it is certain that few sailors would ever risk their lives by trying to cross to Khul from Allansia.

The Ocean of Serpents which divides Khul from the Old World is a safer expanse of water, but since there are few ocean-going sailors in those lands the journey has rarely been attempted. Those who know of Khul's existence hesitate before trying to cross the Serpent Ocean, though – despite its name – it offers few dangers to an experienced seagoer. The crossing to Khul becomes difficult only when you finally arrive at your destination, for the eastern side of the continent is rocky and mountainous, and the only true ports are situated further around the coastline, on the northwestern and western coasts.

Those few Allansian scholars who know anything of Khul's history or geography call it the Dark Continent, though even fewer are able to state exactly why it is called by such a name. In fact the name comes partly from the physical make-up of the most settled parts, where the rocks and earth are a very dark black colour, and partly because of the tremendous wars against Chaos which took place in the centre of Khul while Allansia was in the bloodied grip of the War of the Wizards. We will return to the War against Evil and the Battle for Mankind later, when you will learn more of the ancient history of this troubled continent. For now, let it be said that any adventurer to Khul must know of, and beware, the Wastes of Chaos and the Battlegrounds.

## The Wastes of Chaos and the Battlegrounds

The heart of the Dark Continent was once very different to what it is today. In ancient times it was a rugged but fertile region, with pleasant valleys between gentle mountain peaks, watered by fast-flowing rivers which ran in all directions and carried trade to the city-states on the coast. Great Evil and Chaos festered in the mountains, however, and a vast area of land at the heart of the continent was blighted when wild magic was released as Good and Evil clashed.

The Wastes of Chaos are vast areas of ash and choking dust, where life cannot sustain itself. Here and there among the decay are founts of pure Chaos, like disgusting warped oases, where the very fabric of Nature is perverted by the stuff of Chaos as it spews into the Earthly Plane. Palm trees the colour of blood twist and writhe like living beings, while mindless, jelly-like things howl in their shade; living flesh coloured anything but pink or brown spouts from the ash as wriggling human limbs, while mouths open in the flesh and scream; everywhere Chaos spawns and dies with frenetic abandon. It is said that the sun never shows itself over the Wastes of Chaos – they are covered by swirling clouds of grey dust which prevent Nature from ever establishing a hold on the area again.

To the north-east of the Wastes, the ash plain peters out into a barren, sandy heath, dotted with ruined towers, walls and other military constructions which culminate in the crumbling ruins of the decimated city of Kabesh. Once the capital of the whole of northern Khul, the city was besieged by the Forces of Chaos, and finally pulled apart literally stone by stone. Now it is inhabited by the ghosts of warriors and city-folk, and also by small bands of Orcs and Trolls led by evil spell-casters who grub around in the ruins looking for ways to resurrect the dead armies buried under the Battlegrounds, and once again establish a reign of Chaos over the whole of Khul.

## Ximoran and the King's Highway

The inhabitants of the small kingdoms and city-states around the edges of Khul are unaware of the storm-clouds which are once again gathering at the heart of the continent. The most developed areas are along the western coast, and clustered around the Inland Sea on the far southern coastline. The city of Ximoran was once home to the Shakista dynasty, a long line of benevolent kings and queens who brought peace and order to the entire western coast, though sometimes more through force of arms than careful diplomacy. They built a wide road, the King's Highway. Although in places it is little more than a dirt-track these days, it can be followed south through fertile farmlands as far as the small port of Kelther at the mouth of the River Swordflow. To the north the road makes a wide sweep east, away from the massive area of wild marshland known to the local people as Scorpion Swamp, before heading north to the ancient city of Djiretta, situated on the unpleasant-sounding Coast of Sharks.

The whole area is still under the protection of the rulers of Ximoran, though since the last king died without leaving an heir over two hundred years ago it has been under the rule of a body known as the Council of Seven, made up of representatives sent from each of the major settlements of the area – Ximoran itself, Djiretta and Anghelm on the north coast, the ports of Buruna, Kalima and Kelther on the west coast, and the small walled city of Neuburg on the far southern edge of the civilized lands. The Council has no real powers, though it does provide a unified focus for the whole area, whose people would probably hide inside the walls of each town and city without it.

## The Southern Lands

About a hundred leagues south of Neuburg you may find isolated settlements of short, swarthy humans, who were supposedly the original inhabitants of the lands right up to the Catsblood River, but who have gradually been driven further and further south over the last few centuries. They are crude, violent people, divided into clans and tribes who are fiercely protective of whatever lands they manage to call their own. Border disputes flare up from time to time, and they raid villages and farmsteads, destroying animals and crops and taking hostages and slaves, but swift action by organized troops from Neuburg usually keeps them from doing anything more dangerous.

Further south still, the land becomes more barren, turning from scrubland to wind-lashed steppes, which in turn descend to the edge of the cold Scythera Desert which cuts a desolate swath across the continent as far as the Inland Sea. A few tribes of brutish Goblins live around the edge of the mysterious (and nearly unpronounceable!) Lake Mlubz, though they are slowly dwindling in number under the combined assault of the inhospitable land and their warlike northern neighbours.

South-west of Lake Mlubz lies the abandoned city of Zagoula, once the pride of Khul but now empty and in ruins. Destroyed during the initial stages of the War against Evil, it is a terrifying place, shunned by all but the most adventurous. Some ruined towers and battlements poke above the shifting sands, but most of the city is now underground, and its streets are now tunnels wandered by strange subterranean creatures and a great many undead souls. Legend in the north talks of the treasures which may still lie hidden in the depths of Zagoula, but few are brave enough to seek them out.
