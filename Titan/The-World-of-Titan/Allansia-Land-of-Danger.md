## Overview

Let us start our journey across Titan with the most notorious of all lands, Allansia. It may offer the greatest prizes for a daring, ambitious adventurer, but it also offers the greatest dangers. Throughout the land, the Forces of Evil are drawing together, growing ever stronger: in the north, corrupt humans bring forth wild magic into the world, knowing little of what they are really doing; and creatures are stirring in the southern swamps, things that will ultimately affect all of Allansia. For these reasons, if for no others, you should study Allansia in far more detail than other lands.

Originally, 'Allansia' was simply the name of one small part of the great continent, the extreme western area between the Icefinger Mountains and the northern reaches of the Desert of Skulls. It means 'the Teeming Plains' in a very ancient, much-corrupted Elven tongue, for the land has always been covered with a multitude of races, each fighting for dominance over the tiny corner of the continent. In recent centuries, however, the name has come to mean the entire landmass, from the Dragon Reaches to the Strait of Knives, from Kaynlesh-Ma and Arantis to the Iceberg Straits. Nevertheless, when most people speak of Allansia, they still mean the small pocket of life cowering alongside the northern shores of the Western Ocean, dominated by the unholy vermin-pit that is Port Blacksand.

## Port Blacksand

Blacksand is a relatively new city, built on the ruined docks of an earlier and much larger city completely destroyed and abandoned in the years following the cataclysmic War of the Wizards. Because of the ruins, however, and because it is situated at the mouth of the Catfish River, another settlement quickly grew up among the ruins of the old. Unlike the earlier city, the new one was not designed as spacious and geometric, but is a ramshackle heap of wood and stone buildings piled high on top of one another, a haven for thieves and brigands, pirates and cut-throats who prey on one another and on more innocent citizens. The city is ruled over by the mysterious Lord Azzur, a tyrant known both for his great ruthlessness and for his quirky acts of 'charity'. We shall return to Blacksand and Azzur in more detail later. Suffice it to say at this point - beware Blacksand!

## Geography and Climate

This corner of the continent is wild - mostly rough moorland interspersed with hills and tangled forests. Its climate varies considerably from sticky, sweaty summers to frigid, snow-bound winters, with many days of torrential rain or sunshine in between; despite the best attempts of sages and weather-mages, the weather in Allansia remains annoyingly unpredictable. The land is bounded to the north by the frozen peaks of the Icefinger Mountains, which manage to shelter the lands from the colder gusts which billow down from the Frozen Plateau nearly a hundred leagues further north across the ice plains. The Icefinger Mountains are a desolate place, inhabited by wild creatures like Yeti and the subhuman Toa-Suo. The only humans who venture this far north come in search of skins and furs, if they dare come at all.

## The Settled Lands

The southernmost boundary of the foothills of the Icefinger Mountains is marked by the wide River Kok, which brings trading barges and galleys downstream from the strange city of Zengis twenty days upstream, to the thriving town of Fang, capital of the province of Chiang Mai. Fang is a prosperous place, ruled over by the devious Baron Sukumvit. Every year the locals make a monetary killing from the many visitors who arrive for the Trial of Champions, a vicious death-test run by the Baron with a prize of 10,000 Gold Pieces for the warrior who can survive it, but for the rest of the year they earn their money by extracting extortionate river taxes from the traders who pass upstream and downstream.

Beyond the River Kok, the Pagan Plains stretch for many, many days, dotted with the small settlements of simple peasant folk. The north-eastern corner is watched over by Firetop Mountain, whose summit, coloured red by strange plants, once made people believe it was a volcano. Beneath the mountain, there is rumoured to be a subterranean dungeon complex, ruled over by an evil warlock, though some locals swear that he is now dead, killed by a fearless adventurer. (If so, you may have to look elsewhere to make your fortune!) Heading further south, we arrive at Stonebridge, a Dwarf town famous both for its mines and for its rambunctious leader Gillibran, whose legendary magical hammer returns to the hand of the wielder when thrown! The Dwarfs of Stonebridge are friendly towards adventurers, preferring to vent their anger upon the local tribe of Hill Trolls, with whom they have been warring for many decades.

Heading south, we cross the Red River (so called because of its colour, which comes from carrying red soil from its source high in the lonely Moonstone Hills), and immediately find ourselves in Darkwood Forest, a wild and dangerous tangle of trees and brambles which stretches away southwards. It is bisected by the Catfish River, which flows on down to the sea at Port Blacksand. The forest is home to a great many evil creatures, and a prominent local legend has long told of a large city of Dark Elves in caverns deep beneath it. It is certainly true that hunting parties of Darkside Elves roam the forest after dark, burning isolated farmsteads and abducting humans, presumably to be their slaves.

The lower reaches of the Pagan Plains are windswept and less hospitable, for they open out at their eastern end to the Windward Plains, and thence to the Flatlands, an enormous area of grassland and steppes which stretch all the way to the Sea of Pearls, far, far away on the other side of Allansia. There are fewer settlers on these lands, and a traveller would be hard pressed to find a friendly face until he reached the safety of the ancient Forest of Yore and the walled city of Salamonis, which is almost as old as the forest and is situated on the banks of the fast-flowing Whitewater River, where it runs through the Vale of Willow. The forest is many thousands of years old, and the halfElven tribes who live within its eaves speak guardedly of its many ancient secrets. Salamonis itself was built before the War of the Wizards. By the scale of such matters in those days, it was little more than a small walled citadel, but to the present population it is a solid, ancient city. It derives its name from the Salamon line, who have always ruled over the city. The present king, Salamon LXII, is renowned for his ancient library, which is said to contain many important documents relating to earlier ages of Allansia, but also for his laxness in allowing the Craggen Heights and Trolltooth Pass to become overrun with Orcs, Goblins and worse creatures.

Trolltooth Pass is the true gateway into Allansia, for beyond it lie the Windward Plains and the Flatlands. It is a dangerous place, only three leagues wide at its narrowest point, and bounded by the Moonstone Hills and the northern reaches of the Craggen Heights, two ranges of inhospitable highlands which give shelter to all manner of human-hating races. Along its length are the ruins of watchtowers and fortresses, built by various local rulers through the centuries in an attempt to fortify the pass against intruders. At one point, there are the remains of a massive wall, which stretches for perhaps eight leagues, fortified every two leagues with massive (and now crumbling) gatehouses, before petering away into the scrubland. The ruins are haunted by the ghosts of the thousands of warriors who at one time or another gave their lives to defend this narrow strip of land.

## The Flatlands

When an Allansian wishes to express the size of something so big that it cannot be imagined, he simply says 'as wide as the Flatlands'. The gently rolling plains stretch for many weeks' ride, spanning an area far larger than that of old Allansia, until they slowly dip down to the shores of the Sea of Pearls on the other side of the continent. In comparison to the Pagan Plains, they are sparsely populated, but humans and other beings do live there. Many small tribes of nomadic horsemen roam the wastelands, setting up their villages in one spot for no more than a few days, before moving on. They are short, sallow-skinned people, with slanting eyes and coal-black hair. Horses run wild on the Flatlands, and worse creatures too; both are hunted by the tribesmen, who are experts at wielding bow and lasso from the backs of galloping horses. The tribes could offer a great threat to settled Allansia if they were ever brought together as a single fighting unit, for they are hardy warriors; but they are proud people, fiercely loyal to their particular tribe, and it would take a great power indeed to unite them against other peoples.

The Flatlands are intermittently crossed by trading caravans from Zengis, which skirt the safer northern fringes of the plains on their long journeys to the city of Sardath, and from there on to ice-bound Frostholm and the cities of Fangthane and Vynheim. Sardath is an alarming city, built on stilts over a lake, which is itself squeezed precariously between two sheer mountain peaks. It is inhabited by the rough men and Dwarfs who built the city a few centuries ago to house them while they exploited the many resources of the inhospitable region. North of Sardath, in the foothills of the Freezeblood Mountains (known to the Dwarfs as the Kalaical-, or 'Wall of the Gods'), gold mines penetrate deep into the earth, trappers hunt bear, snow-fox and rarer creatures for their luxurious pelts, and lumberjacks work timber from the thick forests. It is a rough land, and it takes its toll of even the strongest, but the rewards are great for those who can survive.

## Frostholm

Further north still is Frostholm, a land of mountains and fjords inhabited by a race of hardy, broad-shouldered humans who live alongside Dwarfs in their stone and timber settlements. Vynheim is the only major settlement in Frostholm, though every inlet of Bjorngrim's Sea (named after an ancient giant-slaying hero) is dotted with farmsteads and small villages. The city perches on a plateau overlooking Vynfjord, from where boats set off for the open ocean beyond the Giant's Teeth, even as far as Gallantaria across the Ocean of Tempests. The people of Frostholm are strong sailors and doughty warriors, for they have had their share of conflict, especially in the legendary wars against the Frost Giants which once dwelt in the Kalakilr – wars which are celebrated in song whenever the people get the chance!

The Dwarfs, for their part, respect the northmen as great warriors, and there are many links between the two races. However, there are some things which the Dwarfs will always keep to themselves, and for this reason no human has ever entered the great citadel of Fangthane. Ruled over by King Namiirkill, Fangthane is revered by Dwarfs from all lands as the focus for all Dwarf peoples. Carved from the insides of a mountain in the Time of Legends, while the first humans were still learning how to throw rocks, it is truly one of the wonders of the world.

## Shabak and the Southlands

Far away south across the Sea of Pearls (a curious name for a wild, stormy gulf where no man has ever dived for oysters!), the small principality of Shabak thrusts out into the Ocean of Tempests, perched on a peninsula which is part of a much-feared stretch of coastline known as the Storm Coast. Gales blow across the ocean from the east, bringing hurricane winds and whirling tornadoes which batter against this side of Allansia like the hammer of an enormous Giant. Shabak itself consists of little more than the single city-state of Bakulan, which hides away on the western side of the Shabak Peninsula. Little is known of this land, save that some of its merchants occasionally trade with the subhuman peoples who dwell in the Plain of Bones further inland.

The Plain of Bones is another desolate, wind-swept land. It is bounded to the north by the baking Plain of Bronze, to the east by the impassable Bay of Storms, to the south by the uncrossable Mountains of Grief, and to the west by the Swamplands of Silur Cha, known throughout the south as the domain of the Lizard Men. The Plain of Bones takes its name partly from the dinosaurs which roam across it, and partly from the primitives who hunt them. Once, maybe, there was civilization here – at any rate, occasional ghost-haunted ruins of small settlements and fortifications dot the plains – but that must have been many, many lifetimes ago, for now there are only the dinosaurs and their hunters.

Further south still, beyond even the Mountains of Grief, a few small communities cling precariously to the coast around the Glimmering Sea. Isolated from Fangthane Citadel and the other civilized parts of Allansia by the mountains and the plains, and visited by few merchants from the far north as a result, they have not grown much beyond tiny city-states, ruled over by dynasties who occasionally trade with one another, and occasionally war with one another, but who never influence the rest of Allansia. Little is known about these lands by the scholars and sages of the north.

## Silur Cha and the Swamplands

Thick jungles and swamplands line the wide Gulf of Shamuz, making it a perilous place for any adventurer. Even worse, they mark the full extent of the Lizard Man Empire, an evil domain which is slowly threatening to spread out across the face of the south-lands. The eastern part is known to us as Silur Cha, a Lizard Man term which (very approximately) means 'Home to the Supreme Majesties of all Lizards'. At the heart of the swampland there is the unholy city of Silur Cha itself, which is indeed home to the Lizard Man emperors and their human-hating followers. Except in the scrying pools of sorcerers, no human has ever seen Silur Cha and lived to tell the tale, for Lizard Men hate all intelligent life and will allow nothing to cross their swamplands – as if anyone could! The swamplands themselves cover an area almost equal in size to the Pagan Plains, and are inhabited by giant snakes, crocodiles and, of course, the Lizard Men themselves.

The northern extent of the evil Lizard Man Empire is currently spread along the Vymorn River, at the mouth of which stands the besieged city of Vymorna. For six years now, the city has been cut off by the inhuman troops, who have slowly pounded away at the walls until they have reached the inner fortifications and the keep. Vymorna is an old city, built to withstand a great deal, but its back is broken and its people cannot hold out for much longer. Over the six years, a few brave warriors have attempted to escape the city in search of aid, but none has ever made it all the way across the Snakelands or the Desert of Skulls, so no aid has ever been sent. When Vymorna falls, as it surely must, the Lizard Men will find that they are opposed by the equally vile Caarth, the Snake People who dwell in stone cities excavated on the fringes of the Desert of Skulls known as the Snakelands. Even if they win against them, the Lizard Men will simply be faced by the endless wastes of the Desert of Skulls itself. Unless, of course, their attention turns to Arantis...

## Arantis and Kaynlesh-Ma

Just south of that stretch of the Western Ocean known as the Pirate Coast, the city of Kaynlesh-Ma guards the head of the River Eltus, as capital of a land called Arantis. The people of Kaynlesh-Ma are strange, being highly religious and learned, but also hardworking and physical. The city and the land are governed by the Overpriest, who is widely believed by his subjects to be the incarnation of a messenger of the gods, and is therefore treated with incredible deference and loyalty by his subjects. The priests of Arantis are known for their learning, even in old Allansia far to the north, but even more famous are the exotic spices, oils and cloth which merchants bring to the northern lands. Galleys regularly ply up and down the coast from as far away as Fang – making them ideal prey for the pirates of the Bay of Elkor and Blacksand itself!

Not for nothing is the stretch of water around the Bay of Elkor known as the Pirate Coast. While the two cities which face each other from twin peaks at its seaward end, Halak and Rimon, are not especially aligned to Evil, they are havens for thieves, pirates and gamblers, though most of these have their hideouts among the many inlets of the bay itself. Every so often, the piracy gets so bad that the powerful merchants of the three cities force the rulers into action, and for a few weeks the pirates are driven underground - maybe a few are actually caught and hanged. But when the fuss dies down, as it always does, the pirates re-emerge and continue their dastardly trade as if nothing had happened.

North and east of the Bay of Elkor there is only the arid expanse of the Desert of Skulls, which stretches as far as the mind can imagine. Within these endless wastes great treasures are rumoured to be hidden among the ruins of cities like the legendary Vatos, but few adventurers would be so foolish as to try to cross them without an overwhelmingly good reason. Even the rampaging Lizard Men may have some difficulty adapting to the searing heat of this waterless wilderness. Around the northern fringes of the Desert of Skulls, traders and nomads trek on camels, bringing goods to the few settlements of the northern edges of the Plain of Bronze, but they do not go far into the desert, for they know how inhospitable it is.

Pressing on further north, the desert turns into the broken wasteland of the Southern Plain, which gradually leads back into settled Allansia, where we started our journey. Much of Allansia is uncivilized and very hostile, and it must be said that there is as much adventure to be found in this corner of the world as any other - which is perhaps why so few adventurers need ever explore the world beyond Trolltooth Pass and the Southern Plains.

## Notable Figures

### Garius of Halak

The greatest pirate of all those who ply their deadly trade along the Pirate Coast is Captain Garius of Halak. He learnt his trade in the service of the feared Captain Bartella before setting off in his own ship, The Death's Head, to bring fear and terror to all seamen of Allansia, both merchants and pirates alike - for Garius does not care whom he attacks, as long as it brings in gold or precious cargo. He has a secret hideout somewhere along the coast, but is normally to be found in one of the many taverns in the dockland quarter of Halak - when he is not out on the high seas in search of a heavily laden galleon, that is!
