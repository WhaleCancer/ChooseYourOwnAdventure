LIFE UNDERGROUND
Troglodytes live a fairly pleasant life underground, though
it is not without its hardships. They feed mostly on beetles,
moss and fungus, which they grow in large caverns, tending
them carefully under the light of phosphorescent plants.
Occasionally, however, they will hunt out a tastier morsel,
such as a lone adventurer, Dwarf or even a Dark Elf (though
the latter are a very rare, and quite perilous, delicacy,
normally reserved for very special occasions). They are as
skilful as Goblins at setting up traps – though they know little
of more sophisticated mechanical ones –and they often
capture their prey with a well-placed tripwire or a false floor
which tilts its victim into a pit. Troglodytes are great
burrowers, and their tiny tunnels will often riddle larger
Dwarf or Orc dungeon complexes, which from time to time
they will enter to hunt prey.
Some tribes of Troglodytes have managed to tame giant
beetles, centipedes and rock grubs, which they use as mounts.
They have even trained them to stay in line like cavalry
horses, and they use the armoured creatures in their
occasional battles against the larger denizens of the
underground world. Troglodytes are very possessive about
their caverns and tunnels, and will fight against
overwhelming odds to keep larger creatures from taking over
their areas. Favourite Troglodyte weapons include small
throwing-axes and daggers, as well as bows which fire
flint-tipped arrows with great accuracy.
THE RUN OF THE ARROW
In fact, it is their skill with their small bows which provides
the one aspect of Troglodyte culture for which they are
famous – the Run of the Arrow. This bizarre game is played
when Troglodytes have captured a large being such as a
human or a Dwarf (they never play it with Dark Elves – why
waste all that succulent flesh?). Their captive is freed, an
arrow is fired into the distance, and he is allowed to walk
safely as far as that point before the Troglodytes will try to
hunt and shoot him down. One recent Troglodyte, captured
and interrogated by Dwarfs, revealed that Troglodytes
always fire short with their first arrow, just in case their aim
is a bit off that day! Even worse, the creature also told of a
new variant which was being practised by the Uurgag tribe.
Just beyond the point where the first arrow lands, there may
be a hole in the ground, which, the Troglodytes tell their
captive, leads to freedom. The captive is allowed to get as far
as the mark as usual, but when he leaps into the hole he finds
that it is actually full of sharpened spikes! The Troglodyte
seemed to think that this was an excellent new addition to the
game, until the Dwarfs 'persuaded' it otherwise.
SHAMANS AND IDOLS
Like Goblins, Troglodytes are led by high chiefs and shamans,
who organize the tribal worship of their many peculiar gods.
Troglodytes seem to worship just about anything they can,
from Hashak to 'the All-consuming Blindness' (the sun), and
from Scratta Many-legged (a giant centipede of awesome
proportions) to something called Shreech, the rat king.
Indeed, it is quite possible that any adventurer who managed
to impress them with his or her prowess would become one
of their deities too – though he or she might have to die first.
They erect large statues, made from gold they dig out of the
rock around them, in caverns at the heart of their territory,
around which they dance wildly at the least excuse, while
their naked shamans chant and shriek and scream, just as all
shamans do!

Trolls and Ogres
The real heavyweights of the armies of Evil are Trolls and
Ogres, large, brutish creatures who lack even the small
amounts of intelligence and subtlety which Goblins and their
ilk possess. Both are related to other inhuman races, but like
them they have gradually developed their own particular
'culture'.
IT'S A TROLL'S LIFE
As with Goblins, the origin of Trolls is notoriously difficult
to be certain about. However, two views prevail among
scholars who have made a study of such things: either they
developed from early crossbreeding of Orcs with Giants, or
they were in fact created alongside Orcs by Hashak. (Indeed,
when a Troll wishes to pick a fight with an Orc – which is
quite often – he needs simply to say, 'Ha! You're just jealous
'cos you got made second!' Orcs are very irritable when their
supremacy is called into question, especially by something as
obviously inferior as a Troll!)
However they came to be on Titan, Trolls quickly spread
across its entire face, from the tops of mountains to the bottom
of the sea. Despite their wide range of habitats, however,
Trolls are not very populous, for they breed only rarely. Why
this should be is not known, though some scholars have
theorized that it may have something to do with the extreme
repulsiveness of female Trolls, which also explains why so
many male Trolls join up as soldiers.
All Trolls are disliked by those races aligned to the side of
Good, but especially by Dwarfs, who suffer from a berserk
rage whenever they encounter a Hill Troll. This stems from
an incident over seven hundred years before the War of the
Wizards, when the great Dwarf hero Harlak Vanagrimsson
was killed by a tribe of Hill Trolls while trying to force a
passage through the Kalakiir (known to humans as the
Freezeblood Mountains). Even previously, a Dwarf knew he
could expect no mercy at the hands of a Troll – sudden death
would be the end of the matter. On this occasion, however, a
vile Hill Troll shaman managed to bring Vanagrimsson back
to life as a zombie under his command. For three years
afterwards, the Dwarfs of Fangthane found themselves under
attack from their beloved hero, who was made to lead the Hill
Troll armies, until a raiding party found the Troll shaman and
killed him. Now, when a Dwarf meets a Hill Troll, he fights
to the death, praying that if he does fall, his body will be so
injured that it can never rise again.
Trolls do not organize themselves into nations, and only Hill
Trolls gather into tribes. It is only in the armies of Evil that
you will find Trolls working and fighting together, though
their temperament is such that they often end up fighting
among themselves instead of with the enemy. They are rough,
unruly creatures, who enjoy Orc ale and violence, and they
are not cowardly in battle. Owing to their extreme stupidity,
however, they tend to be exploited by Orcs. Now that Goblins
have their own regiments, it seems Trolls are the favourites
for leading the armies of Evil into battle, though the Orcs try
to disguise the situation by giving the Trolls grand titles and
allowing them special privileges, such as eating the dead after
the battle is over. Of course, what the Orc commanders fail
to tell the Trolls is that they are unlikely to survive to the end
of the battle if they go in the front lines! Such is the way of
Chaos, with the strong exploiting the stupid, and death
cheating them all.

TROLL HUMOUR
Trolls are known in many lands for their sense of humour, which is highly developed, but rather unsophisticated, to say the least.
Repetitive in nature and brutal in content, it provides great insights into the workings of the Troll mind. The greatest Troll comedian
of all time is widely recognized to have been one Zark the Violent, who used to wander the Flatlands of Allansia with his travelling
show, until he was unfortunately killed after playing to an audience of Dwarfs by mistake while drunk on cheap Orc ale. Here are a
few chestnuts from his vast repertoire of the very best in Troll humour:
'Why did the Dwarf cross the road? Because I said if he didn't I'd cut off his feet and stick them up his nose! Ugh! Ugh!'
'What do you get if you hit a Dwarf with a very large rock? A big laugh! Ugh! Ugh!'
'What would you say to a Dwarf with twelve helmets on? Nothin', you just hit him in the stomach instead! Ugh! Ugh!'
'How do you get six Dwarfs into an ox-cart? Well, first you take a big axe and you cut them up into little pieces, then you eat them,
and then you get in the ox-cart! Ugh! Ugh!'
