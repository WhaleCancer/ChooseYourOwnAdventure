# The Demon Princes, Masters of the Pit

**Source:** CB77003 - Titan

So, brave adventurer, you now know of the Forces of Good,
who may offer you aid and friendship to lighten the burden
of your quest. You also know of those factions undecided one
way or another, the Neutral Forces, who may rattle a dagger
in your ribs as easily as assist you. And you know of those
allegiances that change with the wind, or so it seems – the
Tricksters who will offer bread with one hand and take it
away with the other, for ever playing their part in some
almighty cosmic joke. All this you now know.
Let us turn our attention to the many horrific aspects of Evil
and Chaos, from the blind, stupid hatred of the inhuman races
– Orcs, Goblins, Trolls and Ogres – to the infinitely subtle
schemings of the awesome Demon Princes. Know the
weaknesses of your foe and your battle is half-won, they say
in Analand; so study your adversaries carefully. Wherever
he journeys in the wilderlands of this world, a pure-hearted
adventurer will find the ranks of Evil arrayed against him,
but by heroic and noble deeds he will win through to his goal.
Wherever you find Evil or the warped mockeries of Chaos,
be it on the field of battle or festering in some lightless pit,
you must be ready, with sharpened sword and steady hand,
to cleanse it from this world.
The Dark Lords of Chaos
The vile Orcs and Goblins are ruled over by their chieftains
and shamans, who in turn give allegiance to a ghastly array
of unearthly Demons. Ruling over the motley ranks of
Demons are the Demon Princes, with their horrible
perversions of courtly behaviour and chivalry. This you may
know already, but few mortals have ever known much about
the even more powerful deities who rule over Evil, even in
the depths of Hell –the Dark Lords of Chaos.
Go far beyond Titan, beyond the Elemental Planes and the
blasphemous Demonic Planes, beyond even space and time.
There, at the heart of the Void, dwell the Dark Lords. They
were imprisoned here at the Dawn of Time by the united
might of the Forces of Good after the First Battle. Some are
remembered in remote, savage corners of the world – such as
Slangg, god of malice, still worshipped in the depraved city
of Khare – but most have passed from the short memories of
mankind and are studied in secret only by the most ambitious
of necromancers. It was once inferred by an insane seer that
the Dark Lords numbered twenty-three in all, though this has
never been verified.
The Dark Lords are thought, in their basic state, to be
formless, shadowy beings, little more than hyper-intelligent
manifestations of pure evil emotion. Some do take on more
material forms for special visits to the various Planes of
existence, but since their imprisonment it costs them dearly
in energy, so that fortunately they can never reveal their true
power on Titan.
Others have had physical forms imposed on them by over-
zealous worshippers who wished to build statues in what
they believed to be their image. But there are thought to be
some who never give any indication of their presence –
though proving or disproving this will require the efforts of
an eternity of seers and philosophers!
The First Lord of Chaos is Death, who holds the entire
universe in his cruel grasp. It was he who imposed on the
world of Titan the doom of Time and the decree that things
may cease to exist, in direct opposition to the gods of Good,
who can only create and mould, but never destroy. In
different lands Death has many names and many forms. To
the rugged warriors of Frostholm in the far north, he is known
simply as the Closer or the Finisher, and takes the form (in
their legends) of a mighty black Giant who wields an axe
forged from the metal of night. To the nomads of the Scythera
Desert of southern Khul he is Krsh, the sound of a man's last
breath, and he comes as an invisible hand to choke and
strangle in the night. Every land has its own stories,
traditions, names and images of Death, but all men fear his
inescapable grip.
Other known Dark Lords include Disease, known as the
Festering Lord in some far western lands. His brother is
Decay, prince of insects and mould and all that rots,
worshipped in southern Khul by the beggars and lepers of
the foul city of Shakuru. They, in turn, are served by lesser
nobles, who rank alongside the Demon Princes in the order
of things, the various kings and lords of the insect races. These
include Arhallogen, lord of spiders, worshipped by the

THE FORCES OF EVIL AND CHAOS


degenerate primitives of the southern Allansian jungles; and
Hmurresh, queen of the flies, who dwells on the Elemental
Plane of Air, from where she dispatches her subjects to bring
plague and pestilence to all corners of the world.
The deities worshipped in Kakhabad as Slangg, god of malice,
and his sister Tanit, goddess of envy and jealousy, are thought
to be related to many of the gods of Good; but it is said that
because they sided with the Forces of Evil during the First
Battle, they were exiled and fled to join the Dark Lords in the
Void. The priests and scholars of other lands may dispute
these beliefs, if they know of them at all, but in Khare unlucky
people are still said to suffer 'the grace of Slangg'. In the weird
temples of the Cityport of Traps, spiteful citizens give
offerings to Slangg and Tanit and implore them to bring their
vengeance down upon others. The former is depicted as a
grossly fat man with the forked tongue of a snake, typically
posed whispering an aside behind his hand. His sister is more
sinisterly portrayed as an astounding beautiful woman,
dressed in a macabre hat, veil and long black robes, with a
wicked curved dagger held behind her back and a cruel smile
on her perfect lips.
The Dark Lords are served by the Demon Princes of the Pit,
though somewhat reluctantly in some cases, since the Princes
are arrogant beings – as all princes are – and do not serve
others willingly. Some Lords use the Princes as their agents
to work great Evil upon the Earthly Plane. Most, however,
use subtler means, and work by suggestion and inspiration
alone. Such is the influence of Death upon the Demon Princes.
The First Lord sets perverted ideas to twist and writhe within
their warped minds and affords them moments of extreme
pleasure when they put another army, city or country to the
sword. Death is the puppet-master who guides the scaly hand
of Evil and Chaos, using its servants to bring about his
ultimate aim – the enslavement or eradication of all life in the
world.
The Demon Princes, Masters of
the Pit
Death is the most deadly of all masters and his chosen
servants are dangerous in the extreme; the Demon Princes
are his chosen servants. They are immortal monstrosities who
rule over the Demonic Plane, using insanity, depravity and
true Chaos to perpetuate their reign over the Forces of Evil
and Chaos. Where they came from, no one dares say for
certain, but in the years before the War of the Wizards, the
highest scholars believed that they were the captains and
commanders of the evil armies in the First Battle. Many troops
on both sides were slain when Death set foot on the world for
the first time, but enough escaped, it seemed, and retreated
to the outer Planes of existence. These are now known
collectively as the Demonic Plane, though in truth there are
many levels; their teeming inhabitants just call it the Pit.
The lords and masters of the Pit are the Demon Princes. Seven
in number, they are the most evil, corrupt, depraved and
Chaotic beings ever to have set foot on the Earthly Plane since
the birth of Time. The seven are informally split into two
groups: the trio of terrifying fiends known to some as 'Snake
Demons', Ishtra, Myurr and Sith; and the 'Night" Demons',
Kalin, Relem, Shakor and Vradna. The former are the true
rulers of the Abyss, and are served on occasion by the other
four.

THE PRIESTS OF SLANGG AND TANIT
The bizarre deities of Khare in eastern Kakhabad are served
by equally bizarre priests. Those who serve Slangg, the god
of malice, dress in robes dyed bright orange and shave their
heads. Unlike other holy men, they always carry a vast array
of weapons and instruments of torture, for part of their ritual
duties is the perpetuation of hate and violence against
non-worshippers. To this end they burn down temples, put
whole congregations to the torch and slaughter many
innocent and not-so innocent citizens – all in accordance with
the rules preached by their deity. Tanit's priestesses are much
subtler, working through delicate intrigues and carefully
planned set pieces. When worshipping, they dress in the same
robes as their goddess, but normally they work in the
community, as it were, sowing the seeds of jealousy and envy
among husbands, wives and lovers, always working to divide
and frustrate, and subvert the work of the servants of Asrel,
goddess of love and earthly happiness.


The three ruling Princes sit together in judgement over the
souls of the damned, in the Palace of Agony at the very centre
of the Demonic Plane. Ostensibly they rule by combined
strength of will, but in truth they argue and disagree so often
that it is only when two side together against the third that
any decisions are actually made. Once every few centuries,
their bickering and sniping gets out of hand, and a bloody
civil war rages across the Pit, with hundreds of thousands of
souls engaged in pitched battles to establish which Demon
was in the right (or rather, in the wrong!). Each of the satanic
trio is served, albeit very haphazardly, by one of the Night
Demons, who captain their armies and act as right-hand
Demons for the duration of the civil war. Currently, however,
Sith is being served by both Relem and Vradna. Several
decades ago this was to Her Disgusting Majesty's benefit, as
each led their half of her forces to greater and greater extremes
to prove his superiority over the other. Now, however, the
spark of unhealthy competition has dimmed, and they fight
more against each other than against the armies of Kalin or
Shakor.
Sith is rather ignorant of the fighting among her own troops,
being far more concerned with the fortunes of her chosen
servants on the Earthly Plane, the Caarth (the desert-dwelling
Snake People). Despite her exhortations, the power of the vile
reptilians is waning, and the various Lizard Man races who
worship her princely rivals Ishtra and Myurr are on the
ascendant. Sith's powers on Titan may be waning, but she still
reigns in the Pit, though only through very careful
manoeuvrings, diplomacy, intrigues and assassinations.
Although the three Snake Demons govern the Abyss from the
ornate blood-diamond thrones of the echoing league-wide
Ruling Hall of the Palace of Agony, they each possess their
own retreats too. Sith dwells in a castle built entirely from
snake scales, perched upon the edge of a seemingly
bottomless ravine near the centre of the Plane of Steel. Its
design uses such a strange, inhuman geometry that a mortal
mind would be driven completely insane just by looking upon
it -not that a mortal mind would have survived the brain-
warping journey through the outer levels of the Pit to reach
it!
Her Satanic Majesty, Sith, Demon Prince of the Abyss, is
probably the most violent and sadistic of all the Demons -
and, as any respected scholar of demonology will tell you
after making the appropriate prayers, that is really saying
something! In her natural form she is even more disgusting
than when in her 'earthly' shape ('a greenish-black, snake-
headed, 
four-armed, 
bat-winged, 
three-metre-tall
monstrosity', as one erudite tome puts it). Perhaps four metres
tall, maybe a metre wide, she takes on the body and tail of an
immense snake, the torso of a beautiful Giant woman, six
claw-tipped arms, and a hissing nightmare of a head which
is half-way between a woman's and a viper's.
Her unceasing lust for the violent death of other beings knows
no bounds, and many poor souls have been slaughtered
simply because she slithered out of the wrong side of her pit
that morning. There is nothing she likes more than slowly
stripping a living creature of its insides, through small
punctures in its skin, by sucking and slurping until the husk
72     TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD


is empty; though sometimes when she is in a hurry she will
simply pull the arms off something and munch away. Like
all Demons, she does not actually need to eat, but she loves
to feel the waves of anguish and pain coming from a dying
creature. Sith feels affection for only one thing – her pet
python, Sussussurr. A truly awesome beast, Sussussurr is
over twenty metres long and a metre thick; he is the immortal
son of Vermistra, queen of snakes, who dwells in the thickest,
most remote jungles of Titan.
Ishtra and Myurr are no match for Sith when it comes to pure
cruelty, but each has his own special facets. Ishtra usually
takes the modest form of a goat-headed, humanoid crocodile,
though when he wishes to impress someone, or make a point
during an argument, he reverts to a raging ball of energy,
spitting streams of electrical sparks in all directions. His great
love is fire, and the strange burning effect it has on contact
with lesser life-forms! Of the three, Myurr is the subtlest (if
such a term could ever be applied to the vilest beings in
existence), and prefers to work through lies, rumours and
other forms of deceit. He typically takes the form of an
enormous toad, or sometimes appears as a sweet, innocent
little boy, who just happens to have the oldest eyes ever
opened upon the world. Myurr spends more of his time on
the Earthly Plane than any of the Demon Princes, in disguise
 or inhabiting the mind of an influential leader or adviser,
working as always to produce as much anarchy and
destruction as he can.
DEMONIC ENTERTAINMENT AND
THE WILD HUNT
Despite their perpetual differences, squabbles and cruel and
violent wars, the Demon Princes and their favoured minions
frequently gather together to take part in gigantic banquets.
Here you might find several thousand undead beings,
sprawled and slumped at tables covered by curious blood-red
cloths with the texture of flayed skin, and piled high with all
manner of dead, semi-dead and very-much-alive foodstuffs.
The stomach-churning food frantically gibbers, squeals and
scuttles until caught and eaten by the obnoxious revellers.
Some diners get so excited that they start to feast upon their
fellow guests!
For entertainment there are the merry antics of torturers, who
gleefully flay new arrivals to produce the most exquisite
music; the Demon-spawn jugglers who mutate endlessly and
juggle with loose parts of their bodies; and the more
traditional singers of naughty ballads. With the floor knee-
deep in blood and slime, the air rent by the screams of the
dying and the sounds of so many vile things chewing other
vile things, the whole scene is how a pious man would
imagine Hell – except that this is Hell and it is far worse than
any mortal man could imagine.
At other times, however, the entertainment is much more
serious. On cold, moonless nights in the middle of winter,
when the crop of fresh souls is running low because it is too
cold on the Earthly Plane for evil humans to go abroad and
kill others, the Wild Hunt rides out across the world.
Usually led by one of the seven Princes – though more may
come along if there is no war raging in the Pit – the Hunt is a
motley collection of Lesser Demons, Demonic Servants, and
Spirit Stalkers and other undead, all mounted on terrifying
undead horses. These unearthly mounts are skeletal horses,
with black skin stretched taut between their protruding
bones. Their manes and tails crackle with a fire which is
mirrored in their insane eyes. The dogs of the Wild Hunt are
the Hellhounds. Howling like something out of your worst
nightmares, the hounds sniff out living beings from the smell
of fresh blood pumping in their veins! Sweeping out of the
midnight sky, the Wild Hunt rampages across the countryside
looking for isolated settlements and farmsteads where they
can collect the souls they require, before moving on to
continue their fun.

THE RUNES OF DEATH AND CHAOS
The death rune is derived from an inverted rune of life
or man, and symbolizes the opposite force, that of death.
The Chaos rune shows a circle, meaning both
nothingness and all things, the paradox at the heart of
Chaos.
