# Troglodytes

**Source:** CB77003 - Titan

Each Goblin tribe has its own territory, within which various
families may live wherever they please. Many dwell together
in caves or villages, but some prefer to live away from the
other tribe members. Tribes are ruled over by a chief and a
shaman, who dwell near to the tribe's recognized 'meeting-
place', which is usually at the very centre of the Goblins'
territory. Every so often, all the members of the tribe gather
at the meeting-place – a clearing marked by totem poles and
standing stones carved with tribal history – for a very rowdy
celebration, during which much potent Goblin ale will be
drunk, ancient Goblin legends will be told yet again, and
everyone will eat until they are sick.
The chief of any tribe is elected, quite simply, because he is
the strongest and most heroic of them all. When a chief dies,
if there is no obvious hero to take his place, all eligible Goblins
are sent away to prove their courage by performing such
deeds as killing a Mountain Giant in single combat, or
skinning a Manticore.
The Goblin who brings back the best trophy at the end of five
days is declared chief, and his trophy is placed on one of the
totem poles in the tribal meeting-place.
Goblins are quite religious creatures, and their shaman is
regarded as the earthly link with their many gods and
demigods. All Goblins worship Hashak, obviously, but they
also spend a great deal of time worshipping past heroes of
the Goblin race, such as One-Eyed Urm, Jorun Dwarf-Boiler
and Klarn Ugbar the Three-Fingered. They fully believe that
heroic Goblin warriors are elevated to sit beside Hashak when
they die, from where they can watch over the fortunes of the
Goblin race. The shamans themselves are quite peculiar
creatures, who often run around completely naked, their
scrawny bodies painted with religious symbols and runes,
and with bones woven into their hair and stuck through their
ears and noses. They are quite frightening to look at if you
have seen nothing like them before, for when they want to
scare someone they can rant, rave and gibber so impressively
that you would swear they were possessed by Demons! Most
shamans are able to do a little magic, and on rare occasions
they can even summon up the spirit of some past hero to put
a curse on their enemies.
The shamans are also responsible for the upkeep of the
totems, which usually hang on poles made from the trunks
of small trees and carved with images from the tribe's history.
The trophies of all the chiefs are fixed to the poles or impaled
on the top, and depending on how old the tribe is there may
be upwards of half a dozen such poles. Every sunset, the
shaman will perform a ritual dance around the poles, and on
very special days he may ask the warriors of the tribe to
procure him a human or an Elf for a blood-sacrifice.

FIVE MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GOBLINS
1 They do not eat rocks and dirt. Orcs do, which is where the confusion arises. Goblins eat roots, berries and quite a lot of fresh meat.
2. Despite the jokes, Goblins are not stupid. They may not be intellectuals, but they can be cunning and conniving. Try telling a 'Goblin
    joke' to one, and you may find out!
3. Goblins do not worship trees and boulders. This misconception arose because someone saw a shaman bowing down before a wooden
    totem pole and a rock on which Goblin legends had been carved.
4. Goblins do not eat their children by mistake. They only do it when they are very hungry, and then it is quite deliberate.
5. Goblins are not afraid of the sky falling on their heads, although it is true that they do not like all that big sky up there, and that they
do not like bright sunlight. If you see a Goblin running around clutching his head and wailing it is just that someone has hit him, that
    is all!


Ordinary Goblins live fairly unremarkable lives, farming or
hunting for the most part. For relaxation, however, Goblins
do like to raid other cultures, or perhaps perform a little
highway robbery on some unsuspecting travellers. They take
great delight in traps and mechanisms of all kinds, and they
seem to find entertaining such thoughts as people falling
down pits on to poisoned spikes, or having their ears sliced
by hidden blades, or having sharp needles stuck in their feet
by springs. Their caves are often protected by very
sophisticated traps, which are usually enough to dissuade
even the bravest or most stupid intruders.
GOBLIN ARMIES
As we have already said, Goblins now form their own
regiments in the armies of Chaos rather than simply serving
alongside their inhuman brethren. They perform many
different roles, but they are most often used as light infantry,
to slip deep into enemy country to leave booby-traps and
sabotage bridges and roads, or as sappers and engineers at
sieges. They are hardy warriors, despite their size, and they
are much less prone to cowardice than their larger
companions.
In Goblin lands, many tribes organize their warriors into
bands which patrol the territory, watching out for hostile
intruders and large animals. Goblins tend to share their lands
with enemy races such as Dwarfs or Elves, and they have to
be very careful to avoid them, and also to hide their villages
away from them.
MARSH GOBLINS
One peculiar strain of Goblins are the Uggluk-jai, the Marsh
Goblins. They differ from their more familiar relations in that
they are even scrawnier, and have green-tinted skin and
webbed hands and feet. They make their homes, obviously,
in the middle of large areas of marsh and swampland, where
they live on small creatures like water-rats and marsh-voles.
They are nasty, spiteful things, even more than normal
Goblins, and they delight in leaving snares and traps
everywhere, perfectly placed for unwary creatures (and
occasionally adventurers) to step into.
They usually live in strange communal huts, which are built
out of mud and reeds on raft-like platforms floating on the
surface of the swamp. Part of them, including the only
entrance, is hidden underwater for protection, and to anyone
who does not know better, they look like tangled clumps of
reeds, though a trickle of smoke seeping from a hole in the
top may give them away. Inside the buildings, there is usually
little light and the atmosphere is very damp and rotten, with
lots of Goblin families sharing the same small space.
The favourite pastime of many Marsh Goblins is to tie some
tasty morsel (such as a plump human adventurer, for
example) to something solid, leave it in the middle of the
swamp, and watch what happens when larger swamp
monsters pick up the scent and come to feed. They also use
live bait to attract large creatures when they are hunting.
Marsh Goblins do not have tribal leaders, but their shamans
are very similar to those of land-dwelling Goblins. They
worship Hashak, like all Goblins, but also a peculiar number
of disgusting marsh deities, including Sluurm, an immortal
giant slug, and Vurrk, Lord of the Marsh Wraiths.
Marsh Goblins speak a weird language which sounds more
like gargling than speech, even to other Goblins. They are
violent and cruel, which is hardly strange for Goblins, but
they are so to one another as well as to other races. Their
various tribes are often caught up in pointless, bloody wars
against one another, perhaps for possession of only a few
square metres of swamp. Marsh Goblins do not like normal
Goblins either, and will attack them unless the latter are very
careful. They also hate Kokomokoa and the other races who
share their swampland domains; indeed, it seems that Marsh
Goblins are always fighting someone!
Troglodytes
Troglodytes are thought to be distantly related to Goblins.
Certainly, they share many physical characteristics, for
Troglodytes look very much like short, big-eared Goblins. It
is quite possible that they evolved from Goblins who started
to dwell deep underground in caves and dungeon complexes
away from their surface-loving fellows. In time, perhaps, the
low ceilings of their cramped domain caused them to produce
shorter and shorter offspring, and at the same time their ears
and noses grew larger to cope with the lightless conditions
down there. Although Goblins can see in the dark, their eyes
are like those of cats, and require at least some light to be able
to see far. Troglodytes, however, developed a system like that
used by bats; echoes tell them where the walls and ceiling are,
and help them pinpoint their prey with deadly accuracy even
in the darkest of situations.
