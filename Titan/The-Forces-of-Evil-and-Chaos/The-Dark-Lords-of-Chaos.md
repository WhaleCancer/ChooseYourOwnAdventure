to take part in weighty conflicts, because their gods were
persuaded that to do so would be to the advantage of the
species. However, being True Neutral, animals rarely feel
regret if they have to double-cross their allies and change
sides – for it is all justified by being good for the future of the
species.
The gods of the animals are occasionally worshipped by men
and some of the inhuman races. Primitives such as Marsh
Goblins and Neanderthals worship the gods of the Court
simply because they are large, powerful monsters with the
ability to cause great pain, suffering and destruction.
Others, however, desire to call upon the help of such creatures
in a time of need, and to get closer to the animals with which
they share their lives. The horse-nomads of the Flatlands, for
example, are worshippers of Evil, but they also pay allegiance
to Hunnynhaa, the stallion god, and pray that he will protect
both his horses and their riders – for if the nomads were
allowed to fall into the hands of their enemies the horses
would suffer as well. If it ever came to a choice between
whether a horse-nomad followed the side of Evil or the side
of Hunnynhaa, he would always choose the latter. In a similar
way, some Orcs give offerings to Almor, the wolf lord,
especially in view of the help he was tricked into giving the
Forces of Chaos at the First Battle, where he served alongside
the champion of the Orcs.
There are even some sorcerers who are obsessed with the
study and protection of animals to such an extent that they
too begin to become entwined in the worship of the Animal
Court. One hears many stories of Hurdagag Greenfinger, who
made the study of moles his life's work. He would often be
seen by intrigued passers-by, lying on the grassy forest floor,
his head stuck inside a molehill, observing the fascinating
little creatures at work! He learnt more and more about moles,
of which he had at first intended to make only a very brief
study. As he learnt more, he became more fascinated by them,
for he had never realized that animals and other creatures
had almost as sophisticated a culture as humans did!
Eventually, the sorcerer's curiosity to know everything got
the better of him, and he moved under the ground to live with
the moles in their tunnels. Such is the danger of obsession and
the quest for knowledge!
Rather than go into every animal cult in detail, which would
be tedious in the extreme, we have simply devised the
following table to show you the names and relations of all the
members of the Animal Court.
