# Goblins - The Children of Evil

Their third basic need, that of fighting, is catered for in their
armies, and also by an increasingly large number of very
violent field-sports which have become popular in recent
decades.
The most widely known of their games is 'Orc Knees', a
peculiar game played by two teams, each with four members,
who are chosen from a reserve squad of twenty. The pitch is
a large circle, divided across the middle by a length of netting
or rope. It is played using an inflated pig's or Troll's bladder,
though cabbages, melons and Dwarf heads have all been
known to suffice on occasion. The first Orc starts the game by
punting it over the net to a member of the opposing team,
who has to return it using only his knees or his head and so
on. If the ball goes outside the circle, the side which did not
hit it gains a point; if it lands on the floor within the circle, the
side which did gains a point. The first team to reach seven
points is allowed to eat one of the opposing team members,
and the game is won when there is only one team left.
Orc-knee players are very highly paid, to compensate for the
fact that their careers as sportsmen are often over very quickly.
Even more violent is the game of 'Pass the Slave', where a
human or Dwarf captive is tied up in a bundle, and then
kicked, thrown, bounced and pushed up and down a field by
up to eight or ten opposing teams from different tribes, who
are each trying to keep the slave alive long enough for them
to get it into one of the small pits at either end which count
as goals. Apart from the basic rule that the slave must be alive
and in one piece when it goes into the goal-pit, and that
players should try to remain within the boundaries of the
field if they possibly can, there are no restrictions on play. As
a result, the game usually turns into a blood-bath, albeit a
very enjoyable one to Orcs. All Orc sports involve a certain
amount of death and violence, because they are crude,
bloodthirsty creatures. But their sports will never take the
place of war .. .
ORC ARMIES
To put things very bluntly, Orcs hate physical work, but love
fighting. They do not really care who the enemy is – and if
there is no enemy, then members of another tribe or family
will do – as long as they are weaker, so that the Orcs can
capture lots of slaves, who provide much of their wealth and
free them from the burden of having to work. When there is
some special prize to be fought for, however, such as the
plundering of a rich city, Orcs will work and fight until they
drop. Orcs love treasure almost as much as they love the
fighting by which they obtain it.
Orcs are cowards, however, and morale and organization on
the battlefield is often a problem, unless they are led from
behind by someone with a long whip and a loud voice! This
helps explain why Orcs fight for the armies of Chaos, which
are invariably led by very charismatic sorcerers and evil, but
forceful, warriors.
In any battle, the strongest and largest Orcs will push the
smaller ones ahead of them, and if they have had enough
time, the smaller Orcs will have cajoled Goblins or Trolls to
fight ahead of them.
Orcs have a lot of stamina, and can march surprisingly fast if
kept in tight formation by their commanders. They have been
forced to learn this, mostly because many creatures cannot
stand to be near them. Only wolves will allow themselves to
be ridden by Orcs, and even they will turn on their riders if
the pickings are not plentiful enough to satisfy their powerful
appetites. Orc columns tend to use the same formation when
they are on a forced march.
The scouts keep about an hour's march ahead of the main
force; their job is to make sure that the road is clear of the
enemy, and to keep the chiefs informed of what lies ahead.
Behind them come the rank and file, divided into battalions,
each led by a banner-bearer. (Orc banners are grisly affairs,
and are often decorated with skulls and other parts of their
enemies, but they give the troops a rallying point if they get
lost during a battle.) Behind the troops come the chiefs,
sometimes being carried in chairs held aloft by slaves or less
fortunate Orc soldiers. The whole entourage is rounded off
with half a battalion as the rearguard, who spend some of
their time watching for pursuing forces, and the rest picking
up stragglers from the main army.
Wherever they march, Orc armies bring fear and death to all
humans, Dwarfs and Elves. It is not hard to see why Orcs are
despised so much, for they are vile, bloodthirsty creatures,
intent on killing as many of their enemies as possible, and
ultimately establishing themselves as sole rulers and masters
of all of Titan. But a nagging question still remains over how
ManOrcs and other foul creatures came into being. We can
only shudder and say that it must be a real nightmare being
a slave to Orcs ..

Goblins -  the Children of
Evil
Compared to Orcs and their ilk, Goblins are indeed children,
but what nasty, vicious, violent children they are! Like Orcs,
you will find them almost everywhere you travel, and they
will always be causing trouble for some poor souls. Unlike
their inhuman relations, however, they are not usually
organized into armies, and many live quite pleasant lives as
farmers or scavenging hunters, though there has not been a
Goblin born who would not exchange his plough for the
chance to rob a traveller, if he could get the drop on him! In
times gone by, it is said, they did indeed serve with the great
Orc armies, but the habit the Orcs had of putting Goblins in
the front line of any attack quickly changed that! Nowadays,
whenever Goblins do serve with Orc armies, they tend to
make up separate regiments, such as the legendary
Skallagrim's Lifestealing Crusade, and the Blood of Heaven's
Deliverers (Goblins are well known for the overblown names
of their regiments!).
Where Goblins actually came from is not known for certain,
and every scholar who has studied them has his or her own
theory. Problems come when you actually ask Goblins where
they think they come from, for every tribe has its own, usually
very different, story. Despite the efforts of many great
scholars and sages through the years, there has never been a
unified theory of their origins. This sort of thing is very
frustrating for us scholars, for it means we can never be sure
of the truth of what we write. However, the various stories
can be very interesting, and they do allow us to indulge in
one of our favourite pastimes –arguing with one another!
The Children of Hashak. One legend states that Goblins were
made by the legendary creator of Orcs, Hashak, after he had
made such a bad job with Orcs and Trolls. He took one look
at his ugly, stupid, violent creations, and decided to start
again, and eventually came up with the far superior Goblins!
This is not as strange as it sounds, for Goblins are much better
than Orcs at many things, though they are also much weaker
and less warlike. Goblins who believe this legend tend to keep
very quiet about it when Orcs are around, for this story can
drive the latter to extremes of violence!
Brothers to the Woodlings. Another legend (not widely believed
by the Goblins themselves) states that there was once a single
race of woodland creatures, related to Elves and Gnomes.
Over the centuries they slowly divided into many different
groups. Some turned into Woodlings, the shy forest-dwellers;
others became the mischievous Pixies; and some were tainted
with a streak of Evil, and developed into Goblins. This legend
also has a ring of truth to it, for some Goblins do still live quiet
lives in the forests and hills of wilder lands, and they do bear
a superficial resemblance to their supposed relations. But no
one, surely, believes that Goblins are in any way related to
Elves? It is interesting to note that if you told a Goblin he was
related to an Elf, he would probably run you through there
and then!
Interbreeding. It is widely known that Orcs have bred with
many other races, both good and evil, over the centuries,
creating many peculiar offspring, including Doragar and
Hobgoblins. It is, therefore, not inconceivable that Goblins
are simply the result of earlier crossbreeding between Orcs
and other creatures – maybe even human – and then
developed as a race in themselves. Goblins certainly appear
to be related to Orcs in many ways that even closer relations
– such as Doragar – are not. Both species are wary of sunlight
and can see in the dark better than they can in daylight, and
they have similar body structures (though Goblins are smaller
and lither), and many of their tribes are organized in the same
way. On the other hand, Goblins are much cleverer than the
average Orc, especially at making nasty little mechanical traps
and instruments of torture. They also have this inclination
towards the natural life, as we have said, which no self-
respecting Orc would ever share!
GOBLINS EVERYWHERE!
However they first came to walk the face of the world, it is
certain that Goblins are here to stay, for they infest just about
everywhere. Not only do tribes of the creatures lurk in every
range of hills and every thick forest, but they are also found
much further afield, in places where you would not expect
them. In the sweltering heat of the southern Khulian
wastelands, for example, Goblins still live around Lake Mlubz
and the ancient ruins of Zagoula. There are Goblin settlements
on some of the islands in the Black Ocean. And even on the
fringes of the Desert of Skulls, a few Goblin tribes try to
scratch a living out of the parched land – as well as regularly
raiding passing merchants. Marsh Goblins, the Uggluk-jai,
are very well known, for they are even crueller and nastier
than their land-based cousins. Everywhere you look, from
Allansia to Kakhabad, from Lendleland to Khul, Goblins are
thriving and multiplying.
TRIBAL LIFE
Goblins occasionally refer to themselves as 'the Goblin nation',
or 'Harajan-jai' in their own guttural language, but in truth
there is no such thing. Certainly, they live in tribes, and are
recognizable by members of other tribes when they meet
them, and they share customs and legends and the like, but
it is not true to regard them as one nation, as one would the
Elves, for example. Most Goblins could not care what
happened to other tribes, as long as the survival of their own
was guaranteed.
