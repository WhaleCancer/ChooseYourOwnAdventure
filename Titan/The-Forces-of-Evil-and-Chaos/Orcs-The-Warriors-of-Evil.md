# Orcs - The Warriors of Evil

**Source:** CB77003 - Titan

THE GENERALS OF THE LEGIONS OF
THE DAMNED
The armies of Hell are commanded by the four Night
Demons, Kahn, Relem, Shakor and Vradna. They sit in the
war-room of the Palace of Agony, huddled in their carved
thrones around a deep, misty pool set in the cold stone floor.
The pool allows them to watch the results of their plans on
the Earthly Plane. The Princes are devious tacticians, working
subtly or blatantly, according to the situation, to further the
evil ends of the Forces of Chaos on Titan.
By gazing down into their scrying pool, the unearthly
generals can look in upon the secret construction of the
dungeon complexes deep beneath the Moonstone Hills,
where the foul necromancer Razaak assembles his terrible
undead armies, preparing to sweep across Allansia and drive
all before him. The unholy quartet look down as the
swarming armies of the Lizard Man Empire continue to
pound at the crumbling walls of the besieged city of Vymorna
– at catapults throwing the heads of the city's young warriors
back to their horrified countrymen, and two-headed high
priests offering up the hearts of living sacrifices to the
demonic generals, asking for just a little more aid finally to
crush the city. As the mists weave, they watch with
satisfaction the eldritch shapes stirring at the heart of the
Wastes of Chaos, and the spirits of hundreds of undead
warriors rising from the battlegrounds, brandishing notched
and rusted weapons while they scream for vengeance upon
the living with a single deathless voice.

THE HEIRARCHY OF THE PIT
Social standing is overwhelmingly important to the inhabitants of the Everlasting Abyss.  Despite its apparent
chaos, or perhaps because of it, there is a very rigid set of rules for etiquette when one Demon meets another,
or some inhabitant of the Infernal Domain who is lower or higher on the social scale.  If the right gestures and
greetings are not made, the slighted party has every right to rend the offender in two, if he is of lower class, or
at least challenge him to some ghastly duel if he is of the same or a higher group.  For all their sickening atrocities,
Demons can be boringly well mannered at times!
Fresh souls have no rank until they have been assigned to a particular type.  This task can only be carried out
by a Greater Demon or Prince, though usually Demonic Servants will handle the assigning of ‘job lots’, fresh
from a major battle, for instance.


Wherever the Demon Princes look, they see the smoke of
battle, the glint of sunlight on armour, the flashing of swords
and the splashing of blood. They see their demonic emissaries
preparing Orcs and Goblins for battle. They see the dark
shapes of Trolls and Ogres hiding in the mountains and the
forests, waiting for their moment. They see ancient Dragons
stirring in their sleep in chambers buried far beneath the
surface of the world, knowing their time will soon come. And
they see the new heroes, the adventurers and the warriors,
defeating their forces in many lands; the sorcerers who still
keep the lights of Goodness burning in the darkness closing
all around them; the ordinary folk who gather together to
resist the incursions of Orcs or wolves or Trolls into their
lands. The generals see all this, and continue to plot their
strategies for the total domination of Evil over Titan, sure in
their twisted minds that victory cannot be far away.
Orcs — the Warriors of Evil
After the lords and masters, we come to the servants and the
slaves of Evil. There are many inhuman races aligned with
Chaos; we shall attempt to cover the main ones here, starting
with the most numerous, the rank and file of the armies of
Chaos – Orcs.
You will encounter Orcs wherever you travel, from the frozen
wastes beyond the Icefinger Mountains to the idyllic desert
islands of the Southern Seas. Wherever you go on Titan there
is one thing of which you can be certain – Orcs will have been
there before you, poking their snouts everywhere. They are
tremendously curious beings, for all their lack of intelligence,
and seem to enjoy exploring and discovering new things
–though they never seem to take enjoyment in anything once
they have control of it! It is this fact which keeps their armies
marching ever onwards, and their miners digging ever deeper.
Orcs rarely keep records, except in the form of the oral
histories passed from shaman to shaman, and they will kill
and eat most humans as soon as they encounter them, so
acquiring detailed information on Orcs for this book has
proved quite difficult. At this point we would therefore like
to acknowledge the great debt we owe to the sorcerer and
mystic Enstaflis Anaren of Shabak, the renowned expert on
Orcs, for much of the data we give here. Enstaflis recently
spent two years in the mind of an Orc soldier from the
Flatlands, gathering even more detailed knowledge of what
it is like to be an Orc, but unfortunately he had to give his
experiment up before he was finished after the Orc's battalion
was ambushed and eaten by a pack of Tyrannosaurs.
However, before he returned to his own body again, Enstaflis
had the presence of mind to collect some amazing data about
the digestive systems of a Tyrannosaurus Rex! The man is an
inspiration to us all.
HASHAK THE CREATOR
Orcs say they are the children of a being called Hashak the
Creator, who is believed by most modern-day scholars to
have been a demigod in the service of the earth goddess,
Throff – though Orcs believe him to have been far more
important than her. Hashak is certainly not very handsome
as demigods go: he is usually depicted as a stunted, brown-
skinned Hill Giant. Hashak was ambitious and curious about
the new 'creations' of the gods, and was especially jealous of
the beings called 'Dwarfs', whom Throff was spending so
much of her time peering at from the heavens. So in a fit of
pique and jealousy, Hashak slunk away to a quiet corner, with
a good-sized lump of the magic clay which his mistress had
used to create those annoying Dwarf-things, and began to
fashion his own creations.
Hashak was astounded by the little things he had made,
which wriggled and kicked as he held them in his fingers. He
called them 'Trolls', and played with them for a while. But
they were stupid creatures, and very ugly, and Hashak soon
became bored with them. He took his Trolls and put them
down on Titan, hiding them away in the mountains where
no one would see them, for he felt embarrassed at having
made such ugly things. But Hashak missed his creations, and
resolved to make some more the next day. This time he took
more care, and created a smaller, more finely detailed set of
models, which could think and talk a little. The word the little
creatures said most of all was 'Urk! Urk!' and Hashak decided
they would be called 'Urks'.
But that day Throff came back early, and found Hashak in
the corner playing with his creations. She was livid, and
ordered him to destroy them at once! Hashak wailed and
cried, but it was no use: he had taken her magical clay and
made some nasty little creatures out of it, and now he must
pay the consequences. Hashak looked at the marbled floor,
and asked sheepishly if he could just take his creations outside
THE FORCES OF EVIL AND CHAOS     75


and say goodbye, on his own, before scrunching them up into
a ball again. Throff was a kindly soul underneath (she must
have been to have taken in the simple-minded Hashak in the
first place, human scholars generally point out at this point),
and she gave in and said he could.
Crafty Hashak had a plan. Scooping up his 'Urks', he went
outside, but rather than saying goodbye he hid most of them
in a dark corner, and only scrunched up a few. Before
returning the ball of clay, he mixed in some ordinary soil from
the garden of Galana, the goddess of plants, so that Throff
would not notice. That night, Hashak crept out and retrieved
his 'Urks', and hid them away in all the dark corners of Titan
alongside his Trolls, before sneaking back to his bed.
What Hashak did not know, however, was that he had been
observed by several of the Dark Lords, who were awake that
night plotting against the other gods. They followed him, and
saw where he hid them. After Hashak had gone, they took
each 'Urk' in turn, and breathed their Evil over it. To this day,
Orcs are tainted with the curse of Chaos, with the result that
they are bound to serve the Forces of Evil, and also Chaotic
mutations are common among their offspring.
SHAMANS, THE TRIBAL SORCERERS
Ultimate power over the Orcs rests with the shamans, the
tribal witch-doctors and magicians who govern all spiritual
matters and provide direct links with the supernatural
commanders of the armies of Evil and Chaos. The tribes each
have their own kings and chiefs as well, but these are more
concerned with the day to day business of ruling over the
Orcs. Tribal chiefs always get caught up in issues such as
whether an Orc was wrong to eat his brother-in-law for
spilling his ale, or whether a captured Dwarf should be eaten
immediately or fattened up for later consumption.
But shamans have far more important matters to worry about.
They must consult with their horrific patrons, usually by
means of ritual dance and blood-sacrifice, and question them
about the immediate future. They dress scantily, usually in
little more than a loincloth and a good deal of garish paint
and blood, and they are always waving bones and skulls
around, for they consider themselves to be Death's
representatives on the Earthly Plane. Orc shamans have
developed a great variety of means of divining the messages
sent by their demonic masters. A common one features a rat
allowed to run free inside a cage around which are painted
the fourteen letters of the Orc alphabet; as it runs to and fro
it is meant to spell out the message from beyond. Other
methods include slicing open a freshly captured Elf and
examining the entrails for signs (a technique known as
'elfomancy'); or throwing into the air fourteen cockroaches,
each marked with a rune, to see what message they spell
when they come back down to earth.
Ordinary Orcs know little about religion, for they care little
for anything beyond the end of today. Indeed, all Orcs are
notoriously unconcerned about the future. Most dream of the
'some day' when Orcs shall rule the world, but none anticipate
it. Perhaps this attitude has developed because they have
enough trouble surviving from one day to the next without
having to worry about the day after as well (or perhaps it is
just because they are stupid!). To the common Orc, shamans
are good for a few heartening spells before battle and for
making the subsequent celebrations fun, what with all their
sacrificing and blood-letting; and they always tell a good tale.
But beyond that they mean very little.
ORCS AND THEIR SIMPLE PLEASURES
Orcs are creatures of simple tastes. They like to eat, they like
to drink, and they like to fight. The first of these three
essentials to Orc happiness is always easy to come by, for Orcs
will eat just about anything they can get their hands on and
their jaws around. Their favourite food is the flesh of their
enemies, and they are noted for the many unsavoury meals
they can cook out of the corpses of Dwarfs and Elves. The
legendary 'Elf Intestines in Gnome's-blood Sauce', for
example, is a speciality of the Severed Arm tribe of Xamen
and the Zanzunu Peaks in northern Kakhabad, though owing
to the very rich nature of its ingredients it is considered a
special delicacy, and is only eaten on very important
occasions (generally, it must be said, to celebrate the death in
battle of a large number of Elves and Gnomes).
If they cannot get fresh meat, Orcs will resort to other
foodstuffs, including vegetables, wood, metal, rocks and dirt!
They have a special second stomach, which allows them to
digest all kinds of hard or sharp objects. For this reason, it is
often very difficult to imprison an Orc for long, for in the end
he will just eat his way to freedom. However, after very heavy
meals Orcs do get drowsy, and often need to sleep after the
exertions involved in stuffing their voluminous gullets. Orcs
who have escaped from a dungeon by chewing their way out
76     TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD


THE FORCES OF EVIL AND CHAOS     77
may sometimes be found close by, fast asleep and oblivious
to any need to flee the immediate area of their prison!
Orcs are not cannibals, however, and they consider it gravely
offensive to eat other Orcs, except in the direst circumstances.
However, they seem to believe that once an Orc dies, he is no
longer an Orc, and is therefore to be regarded like any other
tasty snack! At Orc funerals, indeed, the guests are supposed
to show respect and reverence for the deceased by taking a
large bite or two out of them, before the dear departed are
consigned to the ground or the cleansing fires of the funeral
pyre! Orcs also will not eat undead creatures, even if they are
warmed up, for they do not find them at all filling. Apart from
these two exceptions, however, there are very few things Orcs
will not at least attempt to eat.
As far as drink is concerned, Orcs consider themselves to be
the finest brewers around. Orc ale is extremely potent, often
to the extent of being deadly poison to a human being. Orcs'
favourite drink is a truly vile concoction called 'Guursh',
though some also call it 'Hweagh' – the only reason for these
names that we can think of is that they represent the sorts of
noise one would hear after drinking too much of it, though
perhaps there is some more tasteful explanation really. It
apparently tastes to humans like licking the inside of a mossy
cave with several cockroaches jammed in your nose or so we
have been informed by someone who knew someone who
once claimed to have tried some. What is certain is that it is
greeny-pink in colour, and is kept in lead-lined barrels to stop
it eating through the wood. Orcs consider it a rather light,
delicate drink, and are even supposed to have vintage years
when the Guursh was better than ever: it apparently must
have large lumps floating in it to be declared vintage – large
lumps of what, though, our informant did not say.
Orcs get drunk fairly easily, which is not surprising
considering the potency of their drinks, and in such a state
they tend to perform all kinds of outrageous acts. Every tribal
shaman has a vast repertoire of cautionary tales to do with
drunkenness, such as the one concerning foolish King Morgag
Knucklebreaker, who bought a puddle off a passing Goblin
because he saw the reflection of the moon in it and thought
it was a large silver plate. Then there was Uglar Goblin-Face,
who ate a whole camel for a bet while under the influence
and then burst in a most unsavoury manner. Or .. . the list is
endless. Orcs seem to take great delight in hearing about the
misfortunes of others, including other Orcs, though, of course,
they never realize that they just might be that stupid too!
FAMOUS ORC TRIBES
Orcs are sociable creatures, who band together in large, shambolic tribes, each with their
own special signs and customs.  You can always tell to which tribe an Orc belongs by
looking at his ears, for they decorate them with the symbols of the tribe.
The Throttled Skull: Live in large system of well-protected caves in the mountains of
southern Lendleland; number about 2,500; led by King Yargaas Skull-splitter, who got his
name from a titanic wrestling-match with three Cave Giants; tribal symbol is, naturally, a
throttled skull.
The Clawed Eye: From the central Moonstone Hills in northern Allansia; number around
1,700; led by the ageing Chief Urgari Grinning-Teeth and his twenty three sons; named
after a famous, one-eyed tribal hero.
The Iron Fist: Dwell in small villages in forests near Pikestaff Plain in north eastern Khul;
number only a few hundred; have a peculiar habit of binding iron around their hands with
leather thongs, in the belief that eventually their hands will turn to iron too; led by Chief
Uzgreg Sour-shriek.
The Curse of Vashanki: A nomadic tribe from the Flatlands, led by King Argar Kin-Slayer,
the only surviving member of a family of forty two Orcs, number around 3,000, split into
many wandering families.
