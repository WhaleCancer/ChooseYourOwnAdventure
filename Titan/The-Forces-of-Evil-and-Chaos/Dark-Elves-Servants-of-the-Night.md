ARMY AND EMPIRE
A Lizard Man fighting unit may consist of between six and
thirty soldiers. Each unit belongs to an informal regiment of
up to a thousand warriors, commanded ultimately by a
Lizard King through a succession of captains. There are
always a dozen or so Liash Cha assigned to a regiment too,
for the spiritual welfare of the troops is an important factor
in driving them to victory against the unclean humans.
Different units are assigned different tasks in battle. There
might be a death-squad of mutants, who will lead the force
into the fray, driven by an insane frenzy which is itself
sometimes enough to rout their opponents and send them
fleeing from the field of combat. The 'sappers' are adept at
destroying city walls and gates by using battering-rams,
catapults and the pulling power of Giant Lizards, and
sometimes very delicate magical explosives are administered
by a priest. There are also cavalry units, mounted on Giant
Lizards and semi-tame Dinosaurs like Styracosaurs. There
have been reports from the Siege of Vymorna that some
Lizard Man units have managed to tame Pterodactyls and
Pteranodons, to create terrifying units! Even if this is not true,
it is surely only a matter of time before they do develop such
tactics. The Lizard Man armies are strong and well trained,
and are easily a match for any human army.
The Lizard Man which Ar-KalagOn of Kaynlesh-Ma captured
was a soldier, serving with a regiment called the Kreashian
Kux Cha, or 'the Divine Gougers of Whiteskin's Eyes'. He saw
service at various battles, including the Siege of Vymorna,
which is still continuing. The regiment was made up as
follows:
Commander:  
The Divine Lizard King, Yurnik Eerin Cha
Royal guard:  
26 Lizard Men, the Divine Slaughterers,
 
together with 8 standard-bearers, heralds
 
and messengers
War-priests: 
13 two-headed priests, the Divine
 
Vengeance of Ishtra
Shock troops:  266 mutant Lizard Men, the Divine Scar of
 
Chaos
Cavalry: 
130 mounted Lizard Men, half on Giant
 
Lizards, half on Styracosaurs, the Divine
 
Mounted Death-bringers
Regulars: 
1,326 Lizard Men, divided into 58 units of
 
between 7 and 28 troops, known by many
 
names but collectively as the Divine Gougers
 
Who Shall Bring Death to All
Sappers: 
125 Lizard Men, the Divine Cataclysm of
 
Stone
Others: 
138 servants, baggage-handlers,
 
food-foragers, etc.
The Lizard Man Empire stretches over much of the southern
lands of Allansia, from the edges of the (thankfully
impassable) Mountains of Grief in the far south, across the
whole of the immense swamplands as far as the edges of the
Plain of Bones, and north as far as the Vymorn River and the
city of Vymorna, which is still – just – held by humans. Across
the other side of the Gulf of Shamuz, the Lizard Men control
all the jungle lands from the Snakelands to the edges of
Arantis. They have outposts as far north as Fire Island
(though this is thought to have fallen recently, as no word has
been sent by its commander for some time now), as well as
dotted along the Skull Coast and the wastelands north of the
Pirate Coast. There are also outposts on Khul, though they
are much less important to the Empire, being smaller and less
organized, and situated in rather desolate areas such as the
Scythera Desert and the jungles beyond Marad across the
Inland Sea.
For six years now, the combined forces of magic,
explosives, battering-rams and sheer weight of numbers
have been slamming against the walls of the ancient city
on the mouth of the Vymorn River. It was once an
important focus at the northern end of the Gulf of
Shamuz, with traders coming from as far away as
Salamonis in the far north. It used to have a population
approaching 100,000 people, but they have been reduced
to little more than a twentieth of that over the six years
that the siege has lasted. The king of Vymorna,
Alexandros II, died in a massive assault which breached
the penultimate wall last year, and the troops are now
led by his wife, Queen Perriel, who fights on the walls
with the troops. The people know Vymorna must fall,
but they fight on, hoping in their hearts that they will
buy time for the other cities to prepare their own
defences against the sieges to come.

Dark Elves — Servants of the
Night
You know, adventurer, of the great friendship which Elves
can give you on your travels around Titan. But not all Elves,
it must be said, are on the same side. We made slight reference
to the Dark Elves earlier; now we will examine them more
closely. Information on the Dark Elves is limited, for they are
a proud, secretive and above all very perilous race, and are
not prone to allowing sages and scholars to wander around
their underground domains, even for academic research!
What little we know of the ways of the Dark Elves has been
gleaned from human and Dwarf slaves who have escaped
from their subterranean prisons.
THE PARTING OF THE WAYS
Way, way back at the beginning of the first age of life on Titan,
after the First Battle, when the gods departed to take their
places in the heavens, the world was populated by several
major races. There were the short-lived, youthful humans,
the stout, inquisitive Dwarfs and the graceful, spiritual Elves.
As you learnt from our previous treatise on the good Elves,
the race grew in power and learning, bringing unity and lore
to many parts of Titan. Elves were the elders of the world, the
wise rulers and the advisers. They kept themselves pretty
much to themselves, living in their forest villages and palaces,
but occasionally ventured out into the world to give aid where
it was needed. Their numbers were never very great, for their
near-immortality is balanced by a lack of children, but their
race thrived far more than any other at that time.
Some Elves, however, became disenchanted by the neutral
attitude of the Elven peoples. They believed that since the
Elves were the wisest, the longest-lived, the most skilled and
the strongest of all races, they were natural candidates for
being the lords and masters of all the other races. In the
unceasing conflicts with Orcs, Goblins and other servants of
Chaos, they felt that they should be the leaders, the generals
and commanders of an army which could then be organized
to cleanse the vileness from the face of the land. The Elven
Council did not agree to such demands, however, and
persisted in upholding the non-committal stance taken by all
Elves since long before the rise of Orcs and their ilk.
The leader of one of the Elven clans, Prince Viridel Kerithrion,
was the most vociferous of all those arguing for greater power
and strength. A brave and noble warrior, he had proved
himself a hero in many engagements against the Forces of
Evil. As a result, he was respected by the majority of the
Council, though some feared his rather active nature; it is not
normally the way of Elves to get physically involved in the
petty struggles of lesser mortals, except by offering advice
and some token assistance. Elves know that they will still be
walking the world when all wars have been forgotten, and it
makes them wary of offering physical aid in the manner
adopted by Prince Kerithrion.
Unknown to Elves outside his own clan, however, Viridel
was an acolyte of Slangg, god of malice, who was known to
the Elves as Ar Anwar Gerithan, 'Grey Whisperer of
Shadows'. The god had been worshipped since the Time of
Legends by Elves who wished to learn more about the
transient ways of humans and other short-lived races. Ar
Anwar Gerithan was considered, by those Elves who studied
him, to be the embodiment of the human spirit –malicious,
petty, vengeful and violent. As an acolyte of Ar Anwar
Gerithan, it is not surprising that Prince Kerithrion had as
much interest in the affairs of humans as in those of the Elves.
Finally the Elven prince could no longer stand back and
condone the non-committal stance taken by the Elves.
Gathering together all the warriors of his clan, and of the other
clans who thought much the same as he did, Kerithrion
marched on the Elven Council, which at the time was based
in a large citadel on the edge of what is now the Flatlands,
and after slaughtering over two dozen other clan leaders he
and his rebels seized power over the Elven nations.
94    TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD


Unluckily, he had missed the Council's leaders, including
King Glorien Thelemas and his sons, and most of the stronger
clan princes too. Thelemas's queen, Ariel Aurlindol, had the
power of divining the future, and in a dream the night before,
she had seen Kerithrion's forces marching on the Council.
There was no time to warn the rest, but she persuaded the
king and his family to be absent on that fateful day.
Reaction to Kerithrion's take-over was not long in coming,
and within three days a massive Elven army was camped
around the palace of the Council. For nineteen days they
fought with the rebels, pounding the walls to dust with
catapults and powerful sorcery, but on the twentieth a trio of
Viridel's captains marched out of the ruins waving the green
banners of truce, and asking to talk terms. They were accepted,
and were brought before King Thelemas. While the peace
talks were continuing in the king's tent, however, the rest of
the rebel forces slipped away through tunnels they had been
building for the last seventeen days (for they had quickly
realized they could not hope to win against the united Elven
armies, regardless of how long they held on to their well-
defended position). The parleying captains dragged out the
talks until after sunset, before agreeing to return to their own
side and deliver Thelemas's orders for the surrender and then
lead out all the rebels. The captains returned to the palace,
their way picked out by hundreds of blazing torches which
the defenders appeared to have lit for them. The king's forces
waited until dawn, but neither the captains nor Kerithrion
and the rest of the rebels appeared. Attacks recommenced,
but it was soon obvious that the rebels had fled.
THE FORCES OF EVIL AND CHAOS    95


They retreated only as far as Kerithrion's native lands,
however, where they attempted to declare an independent
nation. In an unusually swift move for an Elf, Thelemas
ordered his armies into Kerithrion's lands. Many battles and
skirmishes followed, before the rebel Elves retreated into the
mountains (in a western area of the highlands now known as
the Moonstone Hills), and from there underground, taking
over an all-but-abandoned Dwarf city which Kerithrion had
earmarked as a final bolt-hole in case all his plans came to
naught. The rebel Elves sealed the way behind them, and the
king gave up the chase. The Council palace was pulled down
stone by stone, and a new one constructed many leagues
distant. The rebels passed quickly from the memories of the
Elves, their actions were never recorded in the histories, and
with the start of the first of the Orc Wars soon after, the Elven
nations were far too occupied in defending their precious
forests.
THE UNDERGROUND CITIES
In the darkness underground, the rebels thrived far better
than anyone could have known. They explored every inch of
their lightless domain, and began to adapt to life without
sunlight. Necessity made them learn quickly: they discovered
how to grow fungus and moss for food, and how to breed
lizards and giant insects. They learnt how to work rock, and
expanded westward until they chanced upon a series of
natural caverns deep under Darkwood Forest in what is now
north-western Allansia. Over the centuries they grew strong
again, but they changed too, slowly turning in their isolation
into true creatures of darkness. Their worship of Ar Anwar
Gerithan grew stronger still, but they also picked up other
deities – perilous beings such as the Demon Prince Myurr,
and many others. They changed from creatures of light and
truth and beauty into a sickeningly decadent race of ghoulish
Demon-worshippers – the Dark Elves.
Now they dwell under Darkwood, and there are small
underground colonies in other parts of Allansia as well.
Recent rumours tell of a Dark Elf scouting party being seen
in north-eastern Khul, though what they were doing there,
so far from home, is anyone's guess. The Wood Elves know
of them again now, for the Darkside Elves continue to send
small raiding parties against their surface-dwelling brethren,
whom they hate with every fibre of their being. To the Wood
Elves, they are no better than Orcs or other trash, and they
give no quarter to any they encounter.
Their city is called Darkside, known as Tiranduil Kelthas to
its inhabitants, and it is a wondrous place. It is built in an
enormous natural cavern, lit only by the dim glow of
phosphorescent plants and fungus and glimmering lanterns.
When the Dark Elves first started to construct it, they began
by using traditional Elven architecture, but gradually the
styles changed, and it is now a bizarre, twisted place, with
towers and walls jutting out at many different levels, and
decorated everywhere with insane carvings of the city's
adopted demonic patrons. Linked to the outside world by a
succession of maze-like passages, each blocked by gigantic
carved stone doors and guarded by many Dark Elves of the
sinister Clan Camcarneyar, it is a fascinating and terrible
place, a city of shadows and Demons, of slaves and dark
magic. Alleys twist and wind between the weirdly shaped
houses; squares may be surrounded by walls so that no one
can enter them; nightmarish parks and gardens glimmer in
the light of caged fireflies, while giant beetles scuttle in the
mossy undergrowth. At the very centre of Tiranduil Kelthas
there is the Palace of Kerithrion, the Aiti Linclále Kerithrion,
named after the city's founder, and after the clan which still
rules over the city. Built out of black crystal, it towers over
the city like the Grim Reaper, as if watching its citizens like a
vulture waiting for a dying creature to breathe its last.
Life in Darkside is very different from that of the Wood Elves
in the forests above ground. In their subterranean city the
Dark Elves have developed their own, highly intricate society,
based on the original rebel clans, which are now led by
sorcerer-kings and witch-queens rather than by warrior-
princes. All Dark Elves belong to a particular clan, which acts
as an extended family. Each clan has its own name, symbols,
badges of office, headquarters, and area of the city, where its
rules are law, and where members of other clans require
specific permission to walk. Many have their own special
languages and signs, which allow members to recognize one
another without the need for symbols; all worship their own
special demonic patrons. Clan rivalries are great, and there
are always intrigues afoot at the highest levels of Dark Elf
society as each clan tries to wrest some small fraction of power
from the others. Rivalries between the clans regularly lead to
assassinations, arson and in some cases full-scale slaughter,
which usually only stops when the terrifying Clan
Camcarneyar step in. They are never allied to anyone, for all
fear them; they are ultimately loyal only to the continuation
of the Dark Elf race, and the city of Tiranduil Kelthas.
A RACE OF PRINCES
While there are some paupers among the citizens of Tiranduil
Kelthas, as there are in all cities, most Dark Elves live very
comfortable lives. The great wealth extracted from the earth
by the slaves in the silver and copper mines has meant that
money means little to Dark Elves, and all but the very poorest
of them are weighed down with masses of silver – around
their necks, wrists and ankles, wound into their hair, woven
into their clothes, engraved into their weapons, painted in
traceries on their skin and so on. Every Elf in Darkside is
related to the nobility in some way, and all Dark Elves have
a regal air, especially the women. Dark Elf women have an
unearthly beauty, far greater than that of any human, with
their velvet black skin, white or silver hair and totally green
eyes; and their beauty is greatly enhanced by the bizarre
fashions in clothing and decoration which have developed
over centuries in complete isolation from those of the outside
world. The whole atmosphere of Darkside and its citizens is
simultaneously similar and dissimilar to the world above
ground, with the result that it is faintly disorientating and
disturbing, to anyone who is not a Dark Elf.
Elven noble society is very competitive, with the fairest
witch-queens of Darkside competing against
96    TITAN - THE FIGHTING FANTASY WORLD


one another at every opportunity. Lavish banquets of rare
fungus and potent moss-wines are common, with everyone
present attempting to score points off one another with acts
of disdain, bitchiness and even violence. Despite their terribly
regal bearing, all Dark Elves have a streak of pure evil
running through their characters, which on occasion makes
them very nasty.
TRADE AND SLAVERY
The merchants of Darkside have more power than their
counterparts in surface towns, for the procurement of food,
energy, slaves and precious metals requires careful planning
and organization in the artificial environment of the
underground city. While Dark Elves are feared by all races
(for they will make a slave of just about anyone, if they can),
they do trade with some Orc and Hill Troll tribes, giving silver
and gems in exchange for human and Dwarf slaves, new giant
insects and manufactured items. Dark Elf merchants meet
with Orcs once every month or so, bringing their goods on
the backs of tamed Giant Lizards and massive spiders to
neutral caverns near the surface, where all exchanges are
made.
Slaves are also very important to the running of the cities, for
the Dark Elves are continually expanding their caverns and
mining for more precious metals and gems. Slaves are usually
taken in raids on the surface, though some are exchanged
during trade with other evil races. Humans are most common,
for they are the easiest to obtain, but Dwarfs are the most
popular, because of their hardy nature (which can take all the
regular beatings the Dark Elves inflict upon their captives)
and because they know how to work rock and find the best
seams of metal. Orcs, Trolls and Goblins are sometimes used
for the most menial tasks, but they are weak, spiritless
creatures, and the Dark Elves often kill them before their time
out of frustration.
Elves are never kept as slaves. Those who do not die in the
initial encounter (since Dark Elves inspire Wood Elves to
amazing acts of suicidal fury) or who are not slaughtered
immediately after, are commandeered by the sorcerers and
witches for eventual sacrifice in one of their horrific rites,
though most will be tortured interminably until this happens.
Despite their mutilations and deprivations, Wood Elves have
never been known to utter a single word to their Dark Elf
captors, nor even to cry out in pain, and the Dark Elves have
never learnt anything from their Elven captives.
RAIDING THE SURFACE WORLD
Slaves are exchanged for silver and gems with the Orcs and
Hill Trolls, and captured in raids on the surface. Such raids
are usually carried out by members of the Clan Camcarneyar,
who creep about the darkened forests at night in raiding
parties of not more than eight, hidden by black cloaks and
clothing, and by protective magic which shields them even
from the heightened senses of animals. They usually pick
upon isolated farmsteads or small hamlets, where they know
they will not be opposed by more than a dozen humans or
Dwarfs, and always wait until the moon has set before
attacking.
They first spread out around the target, and then cast a
blanket of spells to stop them being detected by farm animals,
who might wake the inhabitants. Flaming arrows on to the
roof launch the attack, and are followed by a full-scale assault
on all sides as the Dark Elves break in through windows and
doors, dispose of any resistance with their long, jagged
knives, and drag their captives off into the night. The raiders
of the Clan Camcarneyar prowl the surface world most
nights, ranging further and further afield in their search for
victims.
