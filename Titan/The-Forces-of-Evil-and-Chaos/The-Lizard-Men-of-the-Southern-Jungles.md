many slaves were kept when not being put to work
elsewhere. Although they are not always good designers,
their skills at working rock are nearly a match for those of
Dwarfs or Skorn.
At the top of the mesa, the Caarth scraped away a smooth
expanse of rock, to form a wide avenue, which is lined on
either side with disconcerting statues of warriors, priests and
Demons, and ends in a small stepped platform on which
many sacrifices are made. Behind the platform is the main
temple to Sith, a monstrous, pyramid-shaped place of
shadows where the whole floor perpetually slithers with
snakes of all types and sizes. Indeed, much of the citadel is
infested with the scaly reptilian creatures, who are regarded
as pure and sacred by all Snake People. The snakes
occasionally bite slaves and one another, but never attack a
Caarth or Justrali.
FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
Casting their shadows down over the top of the mesa are the
tallest of the towers of S'turrak, which house the high priests
and the mystic library and observatory of the Caarth
sorcerers. The Snake People have not been on Titan as long
as some races, but they have collected a great deal of
knowledge from every source they can. Prisoners are
thoroughly questioned, and hypnotism or mind-loosening
potions are used to extract every last scrap of knowledge from
their frightened minds before they are turned over to the
slave-masters. Caarth sorcerers apparently excavate ancient
desert cities, in their constant search for new learning. In their
libraries they keep records of all their knowledge, written in
their indecipherable script on thin slivers of metal and stone,
which will not suffer the ravages of time as badly as
parchment.
In their observatories, Caarth use telescopes of prodigious
size, with lenses and mirrors made, by obscure magical
techniques, from massive discs of highly polished quartz;
with these they observe the stars and gradually map out the
universe. It is widely believed that the Caarth have discovered
other planets near to Titan, something which human scholars
have long suspected but have never been able to prove.
The Snake People know much of other topics too. Their
knowledge of poisons and venoms is unequalled. They have
poisons, extracted from snakes, spiders and desert scorpions,
for all purposes — to make an enemy sleep or die, to turn him
insane or make his body break out in reptilian scales in
preparation for another ghastly Caarth experiment. Most
Caarth and Justrali weapons are coated with poison of one
sort or another, which invariably makes them fatal, even if
they only graze an opponent.

THE CITIES OF THE SNAKE PEOPLE
This map is based upon one drawn from memory by the merchant Voloidon Carsak, and is only approximate,
but it is the best anyone has ever been able to manage.


The knowledge Caarth sorcerers have of mutations and
interbreeding is also vast, for they have been creating new
species for many centuries in unholy attempts to continue the
work of their snake forefathers by creating the most powerful
combination of humans and snakes possible. This is how the
Justrali were created, along with many other less successful
mutations which lurk in the desert, abandoned by their
creators. The priests of S'turrak also attempt to resurrect their
forefathers by reshaping slaves' bodies into vehicles for their
souls to return to life, but these experiments have been
notoriously unsuccessful, as the case of the nearly legendary
Serpent Queen of Port Blacksand shows.
SITH'S REPRESENTATIVES ON THE
EARTHLY PLANE
The Snake People are ruled over by their high priests, who
act both as commanders of their armies, and as the direct
representatives of their beloved Sith on the Earthly Plane. The
high priest of S'turrak at the time when Carsak was there was
known as H'kchktaress (which means, according to Carsak,
'Venom Drips Like Honey from His Blade' in the language of
the Caarth), and he was a pure embodiment of evil. His duties
included the ritual sacrificing of slaves to Sith, and the
conjuring of Sith's demonic servants in the mesa-top temple
for consultations.
He was also the head of the city's Caarth and Justrali warriors,
and one of the trio of leaders of the Caarth nation. The power
of the Snake People has been on the wane in recent years, for
they have been penned into the desert regions by the colder
climates of the northern and southern lands, and they have
had little new territory to overwhelm. They are also using up
their supply of slaves from the subhumans who live on the
fringes of the Desert of Skulls, and cannot roam further afield
for them. Sith has not been able to concentrate on their
problems, as she has been distracted by another civil war with
her fellow Demon Princes. In the meantime, in Allansia,
Ishtra's Lizard Men have been creeping ever closer to the edge
of the temperate wastes known as the Snakelands, which
divide the Desert of Skulls from Vymorna on the edge of the
southern jungles. The Lizard Men may have been held at the
Siege of Vymorna for a short while, but it can only be a matter
of time before they push towards the territory of the Snake
People. When this time comes the fighting will be fierce and
bloody, as the whole of the southern lands will be plunged
into war.
The Lizard Men of the Southern
Jungles
The gruesome Snake People are common to both Allansia and
Khul, though it is in the former that they are really powerful.
This is also true for the Lizard Men, though their successes
far overshadow those of the Caarth. It is looking increasingly
likely, to sages and scholars who know of such things, that
the main threat to humanity on Allansia will soon be the
Lizard Man Empire, which already covers an area larger than
all the settled parts of Allansia put together. Until fairly
recently, however, few learned men were able to glean much
information about the Lizard Men, for they would try to kill
any human they came across,

whether he was a heavily armed warrior or a poor defenceless
sage. But only four years ago, the great mystic Ar-Kalagon of
Kaynlesh-Ma managed to capture a Lizard Man warrior, and
subject his mind to a form of magical interrogation. He cast
several hypnotic enchantments on the gross, leathery being,
and then magically read the contents of his mind in a scrying
pool. Ar-Kalagon learnt much about the Lizard Man culture
.. .
IN THE BEGINNING
During the Godtime, there were many lesser deities,
including gods of all the animals. Among these was a very
sly and ambitious god, who is known to those on the Earthly
Plane as Suthis Cha. When the greater gods began fashioning
human-shaped creatures to people the world, Suthis Cha
became very jealous of them, for he considered his own lizard
form to be the most beautiful of all shapes (he was arrogant
and conceited, as well as sly and ambitious). So whenever the
gods were working on their creations, Suthis Cha ensured
that he was close at hand, quietly watching and remembering
how creatures were shaped, in preparation for the time when
he would create his own beings, to bring his image to the face
of the world.
The First Battle began, with the evil powers fighting to
overcome the Forces of Good and wrest control of the
universe from them. All the gods and lesser deities were
drawn into the conflict – all, that is, save Suthis Cha. Being
blessed with some slight powers of divination, the scaly god
had foreseen the coming battle, and seized his chance to slip
away unnoticed. So when the battle was at its height, Suthis
Cha was on the Earthly Plane, carving and moulding the first
Lizard Men from swamp mud and lizard skins. He hid his
creations away in the swamplands of Titan, knowing they
would be safe there, out of sight of the other gods and their
own creations, and returned to the Outer Planes. Upon
returning he encountered the tiny mouse god, Karreep,
cowering with fright in a quiet corner of the Halls of the Gods.
There was no one else around, so Suthis Cha gave in to
temptation and did something he had been desperately
wanting to do for many a long aeon – he ate Karreep. The
mouse god was, however, a god, and fought back with all his
might. Suthis Cha choked to death (in so far as a god can die
– he transmuted), as the small furry thing grew and stuck in
his throat, before hopping out as the scaly deity crashed to
the marble floor of the Halls of the Gods.
The Lizard Men thrived in the swamplands, and quickly
became even more cunning than their four-legged relations.
Without a god, however, they were disorganized and
unambitious, preferring simply to swim about their marshy
domains, hunt smaller beings, climb trees, sun themselves
and generally have a lazy time of it. As the Dark Lords
recovered from their exile in the aftermath of the First Battle,
however, one noticed the scaly little things which ran around
in the swamps and jungles of Titan, and asked the Snake
Demon Ishtra to investigate. The crafty Demon Prince did
more than that – he appeared to the Lizard Men while they
were gathering for their regular midsummer's eve spawning,
as a gigantic Lizard Man, spitting fire and wielding a flaming
sword against the setting sun. The Lizard Men abased
themselves before him, and they have worshipped his unholy
form from that moment on. In time, various other gods and
deities were introduced into Lizard Man culture by their
powerful priests, including Myurr, another Demon Prince,
and numerous lesser Demons and reptilian gods. Ishtra also
brought the taint of Chaos to the race, initially to create the
powerful two-headed priests who would act as his focus for
ruling over the Lizard Man race – but this also brought the
curse of mutation to ordinary Lizard Men.
THE LIASH CHA
Not all two-headed Lizard Men are priests, but all Lizard Man
priests have two heads. They are an elite class among the
Lizard Men, known properly as the Liash Cha, and they have
the power to do almost anything they wish. They dress in
particular ways (they are the only Lizard Men allowed to
wear the sacred colour red, for example), have their own
language and are the only Lizard Men able to write. The
centre for the priesthood is the Temple to Ishtra, in the centre
of the Silur Cha swamplands, about fifteen leagues away from
the capital city, Silur Cha. Part monastery and part
astronomical observatory, it is home to several thousand
two-headed priests and their servants, who spend all their
time in performing rituals, sacrifices, prayers and other
unholy duties. The priests have collected a great store of
knowledge over the centuries, much of it unknown to
civilized man, for they have peculiarly logical, unemotional
minds which seem able to grasp some philosophical questions
much better than men or Elves can. Their observatories are
sophisticated to a degree unheard of in civilized lands, and
they have learnt much about the universe and its workings.

On the other hand, their cold, calculating, unemotional
natures make them cruel and violent, for they have no feelings
for other creatures, or even other members of their own race.
The Liash Cha believe, above all things, in the purity of their
race, which they have been taught (by Ishtra) to consider the
high point of all of Nature's creations. They despise the
mutant Lizard Men as a result, and sacrifice many to the gods
to appease them, and to try to persuade them to stop the curse
of Chaos. Living sacrifices are common, and many of their
captives suffer this fate.
THE LIZARD KINGS
Although the priests run the religious side of the Lizard Men's
life, the politics are cared for by the Lizard Kings. Each tribe
is ruled over by a Lizard King, and they in turn pay fealty to
the Council of Thirteen, who sit in Silur Cha, the Lizard Men's
capital in the southern swamplands of Allansia. The Lizard
Kings may once have belonged to the same species, but now
they are a distinct race, being much larger and stronger, and
with greater mental powers – though they will never match
those of the Liash Cha. It is believed that they are telepathic,
able to keep in touch with all other members of their race by
thought alone, though the extent of this communication is not
known. Lizard Kings also seem to have some form of
empathic hold over their people, for when a Lizard King is
killed on the field of battle, his troops immediately become
confused and disorientated, as if they were suddenly being
released from hypnosis in a strange, unfamiliar place.
Whatever the truth of this, the Lizard Kings do hold the
ordinary Lizard Men in their scaly grip, and have the power
of life and death over the entire Lizard Man Empire.
The Council of Thirteen is led by the High King, the Luk Ten
Cha, who is widely believed to be a physical embodiment of
their gods, sent to the Earthly Plane to watch over the Lizard
Men. When he dies (Lizard Kings live to around 130 years,
almost twice the span of normal Lizard Men), it is believed
that he is reborn that same instant, as his life-force passes into
a newborn Lizard Man freshly hatched in the egg chambers
of the palace. When the new child reaches thirteen years old,
he is brought before the Liash Cha, who perform the Ritual
of Remembering, during the course of which the Luk Ten Cha
slowly begins to remember all his past lives, and all his past
knowledge, and is then ready to take his place as ruler of the
Lizard Man Empire once more. In the intervening thirteen
years, each member of the Council in turn rules the land for
a year.

LIZARD MAN LANGUAGE
Lizard Men use a very strange language, where every slight inflection of the voice, wave of a hand, or position of a tail means something
completely different. The word 'Cha', for example, can mean 'us', 'we', 'him', 'I', 'Lizard Men', 'religious', 'good', 'beautiful', 'swampy',
'delicious' and 'to give orders'. Owing to their swampland habitat, Lizard Men have over a hundred names for different conditions of
the swamp, and they can recognize a great many different types of grass and tree which all look identical to us humans.
The Liash Cha have their own language, which deals almost exclusively with high-powered religious and philosophical arguments.
They are almost unable to carry on a normal conversation in it, though they rarely indulge in everyday small talk anyway.


SILUR CHA, THE LIZARD MAN CITY
The High King, the Luk Ten Cha, dwells in a gigantic
towering palace at the very centre of the bizarre city of Silur
Cha, which itself is right at the centre of the Lizard Man
Empire, in the southern swamplands of Allansia. Silur Cha
has been built out over the swamps, and much of it rests upon
wooden platforms, with only the most important buildings
having stone foundations (usually created by magically
transmuting the mud of the quagmire into solid rock, a
process which requires a great many spells and innumerable
sacrifices). The Lizard Men have other fortifications and other
cities dotted around their Empire, but Silur Cha is the
crowning glory of all of them. It has taken several thousand
years to reach its present form, and it is being added to all the
time, as the Lizard Men's power grows ever stronger.
Silur Cha is a maze of temples, dwellings, open wooden
walkways (both on the surface and way up in the sky), towers,
barracks, wide squares, pools and streams, all cut out of the
swampland itself. Everywhere is decorated with carvings of
Lizard Men, their gods, history and battles. Silur Cha is
situated on a great U-shaped curve in the nameless river
which waters the swamplands. The Lizard Men are not used
to being sailors, but their strangely proportioned and
bizarrely decorated boats regularly ply up and down the
jungle and swampland rivers which they control, and can
occasionally be seen out at sea, ferrying supplies to one of
their outlying colonies. On a few occasions, way back before
the War of the Wizards, the Lizard Men actually fought
sea-battles against other nations, though there are now few
nations with fleets strong enough to fight such battles.
LIZARD MAN SOCIETY
At the top of Lizard Man society, we know there are the
Lizard Kings and the Liash Cha, the two-headed priests. But
what of the regular Lizard Men? Most dwell in tribes, which
are subdivided into families. Each tribe has its own area, as
well as its own peculiarities of dress, language, weapons and
so on. Lizard Men often paint their bodies with markings
which distinguish them from other tribes, and they also use
scars and cuts on their bodies for the same purpose. The tribes
are each ruled by a Lizard King, who usually lives in some
splendour at the heart of the tribal territory, taking tributes
in the form of servants, food and goods from his people.
A typical Lizard Man family is made up of between ten and
thirty creatures, who all dwell in the same area of the swamp.
Their houses come in many different shapes and
constructions. In the heart of the swamps, they may be
wooden cabins perched on legs sunk deep into the sludge, or
tree-houses with carefully woven rope bridges linking
wooden platforms. On more solid land, Lizard Men are likely
to live in huts, which are made of mud and branches, and are
huddled against one another to create a low, sprawling
building with lots of small rooms.
Many Lizard Men (especially females and adolescents) spend
their days hunting for food in the swamplands, using snares,
spears and even their teeth and brute strength to catch food
for the family. Some pursue crafts, such as vine-weaving,
carpentry or weapon-making, while others teach the younger
members of the tribe the rudiments of hunting and other
skills. In the cities and towns, and especially in Silur Cha,
there are traders, slave-masters, metal-workers and other
craftsmen, just as in a human city, though there are
differences. Lizard Men have little need for fire – they live in
very warm climates, eat all their food without cooking it, and
can see in the dark – and it is only really used for smelting
metal and at ceremonial occasions. The priests, however,
delight in using fire, for they know the effect it has on others.
Many Lizard Men are enlisted into the armies of the Lizard
Man Empire, serving their kings for the greater glory of the
Lizard Man race in many parts of the southern lands. Indeed,
for mutated Lizard Men, the army is the only choice open for
them, for they are not allowed to join tribes and are never
allowed into a city like Silur Cha without special permission
or as part of a serving battalion. They are outcasts from the
whole of society, and are 'encouraged' to serve in the army,
where good use is made of their prodigious strength.
