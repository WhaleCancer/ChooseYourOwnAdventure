OGRES AND THE TAINT OF CHAOS
Orc shamans tell the following story about the creation of
Ogres; it is not known where it originated, but it has been
around for many centuries.
At the end of the Godtime, when Death and his fellow Dark
Lords had been banished into the Void for releasing Time into
the world, there were still many places on Titan where the
power of Chaos was strong. In one such area, now thankfully
sunk beneath the sea after the continents shifted, Hashak, the
creator of the Orcs, placed some of his new-born Orcs. It was
a dark place, like all the others in which Hashak had left his
creations to grow, and Hashak did not look into it too
carefully. He had a great many of his Orcs to hide before the
sun rose again, and he was in a hurry to finish his task.
In the darkness, the new-born Orcs grew quickly, but they
grew with the taint of Chaos in their flesh, not knowing it was
changing them. By the time they were strong enough to set
foot outside in the light, they had been warped by it, and they
were different from the other Orcs – they were now Ogres,
the Warped Ones. Since that time, long, long ago, the other
races aligned with Evil have become touched with the taint
of Chaos, and mutations are common, but no other race has
Chaos at its core. There are still many Orcs who are normal
in shape and mind, but no two Ogres are ever the same.
During the War of the Wizards, when Chaos returned to the
world in great strength, Ogres formed a large part of the evil
armies. They would lead mutating troops into battle,
marching ahead of nameless beings which writhed and
formed new shapes even as they wriggled and crawled
towards the enemy! The armies of Chaos were ultimately
defeated, however, and the few remaining Ogres were
scattered across the face of the world again.
Many Ogres live pitiful lives away from civilization, which
spurns them as it would any other mutant, though most Ogres
look almost normal on the outside. They lurk in caves in the
wasteland, and live by hunting whatever they can catch. They
have little or no tribal organization, no leaders and no
shamans. However, in the mountains south of Lendleland
known as the Anvils of the Gods, there is talk of 'the Three',
a trio of Ogres who have somehow learnt the ways of
sorcerers and shamans, and who practise magic! While it is
conceivable that a Chaotic creature could be spawned with
some innate magical powers, it is quite ludicrous to suggest
that three such creatures could have the powers of master
sorcerers simply by chance. Until we know more about 'the
Three' we cannot give any more accurate details, though it
certainly seems to most learned people that some great
sorcerer or unearthly being must have been involved in
granting such powers to three Ogres. However, from the
rumours we have heard, their powers are very great, which
makes them incredibly dangerous. They seem to provide yet
more evidence of the resurgence of Chaos in the forgotten
corners of our world.
Some Ogres are beginning to find service in the armies of
insane servants of Evil such as the necromancer Razaak,
where they are proving themselves strong and reliable. These
days, their Chaotic nature more often than not results in
nothing more than some small mutation, such as scaly skin,
boils, horns or a third eye. They are proving to be very
valuable troops, if given sufficient training to cope with such
incredibly complicated weapons as bows and slings! One very
famous Ogre was Naggamanteh, the brutal Master Torturer
to the evil Archmage of Mampang in Kakhabad. Grossly
deformed, with only one eye and a face that made milk turn
sour and even grown Trolls feel ill, Naggamanteh was very
successful at his job, and turned it almost into an art – though
a very sick, depraved one! Many of his specialities have
passed into the lore of other torturers, who swear by
'Naggamanteh' s rusting thumbscrews!' and 'the Ogre's
crushing clamps!' In fact, Naggamanteh even penned
Naggamanteh's Book of Tortures (he was not very good on
titles), which has long been recognized as a masterpiece by
torturers across Titan – and although the spelling is atrocious,
it shows just how successful an Ogre can become if given the
right outlets for his 'talents'.

The Snake People
The races we have discussed up to now have been crude,
barbaric and not too gifted with intelligence. But now we
come to three races which are far more sophisticated in their
service of Evil and Chaos. We shall shortly discuss the
accursed Lizard Men of the southern jungles and the demonic
Dark Elves of Tiranduil Kelthas, deep beneath the surface of
the world. But let us start in the baking deserts of Titan, with
the Snake People.
SOME LIKE IT HOT
The Snake People of Allansia and Khul dwell only in the very
hottest parts of the Desert of Skulls and the Scythera Desert,
for they are cold-blooded creatures who need warmth to
survive. It is this basic need which has kept them from
encroaching on more temperate lands and spreading their
cruel dominion to more populated areas of the world. As it
is, they control vast areas of the two continents, bringing their
own peculiar forms of death to many peoples.
The Caarth, who are the major race of all those known
collectively as the Snake People, have long been creatures of
legend, and subject to all kinds of myths and conceptions.
Many past writers of bestiaries and myths have described the
Caarth as bald, snake-tailed monstrosities, for they had to use
hearsay, in the absence of any first-hand accounts of meetings
with such creatures. In fact, however, they are more like
snake-headed humans, similar in form to the Lizard Men of
the southern jungles, and with a similar attitude to the other
races of Titan: they simply wish to kill every last member of
every last one!
From their stone cities deep in the desert wastelands, they
send forth their warriors to conquer and enslave all lands
around them. During one such raid, about thirty years ago,
a band of Caarth warriors captured a travelling merchant,
Voloidon Carsak by name. Fearing for his life, the man fainted
clean away when the serpent warriors came over the ridge in
front of his caravan, but woke to find himself strapped upside
down across the back of a Giant Lizard, just behind its
scaly-skinned rider. He was taken as a slave to a small
encampment by a desert oasis, before being moved on to a
massive stone citadel on the edge of some low, rocky foothills.
Here he was put into service, first as a litter-bearer for a
high-ranking Caarth priest, and later as a trusted slave to a
captain of the serpent warriors' armies. Eventually, after
twelve years, he worked himself into such a position that he
was left alone for a good part of the day, and Carsak gradually
secreted away enough food and water to attempt to escape
from his captors, though he knew that if he was caught he
would be skinned alive and his body offered to the desert
scorpions.
He chose his moment well. His master, along with many other
Caarth warriors, was called away to the southern frontier in
the Snakelands, where a Lizard Man expeditionary force was
scouting for suitable settlement sites. Carsak had memorized
the exact position of the citadel from maps he had seen while
in the service of the Caarth priest, and his extensive
knowledge of the trade-routes helped the rest of the way.
Eventually, painfully thin and dehydrated but still alive,
Voloidon Carsak staggered into the camp of a trader from
Warpstone, who was bound for Salamonis in the southern
part of settled Allansia. Carsak reached Salamonis and
revealed the previously unknown world of the Snake People.

Carsak's own recollections of his life among the Snake People;
although it is more than fifteen years old, much of it still
applies, and we have managed to add more recent details by
the careful use of divinatory magic.
SITH'S REVENGE
When the Dark Lords of Chaos were banished from the
Earthly Plane and imprisoned in the Void, their generals, the
Demon Princes, fled into the darkest corners of what became
known as the Demonic Planes, where they quietly rebuilt their
strengths. The most dominant of all Princes was the Snake
Demon Sith, who quickly established herself as the most
worthy servant of the Dark Lords with the grossest acts
against her fellow Demons, and later against earthly beings.
Sith's great love is for snakes (the title given to her by scholars
on the Earthly Plane, Snake Demon, stems from this), and she
wanted to find some way of increasing their power on Titan,
to carry out her revenge on the Forces of Good which had
banished her masters and caused her to hide away in fear in
the outer reaches of the multiverse for so long.
Inspired by the Orcs and the other inhuman races, which were
by now teeming everywhere across the surface of Titan, she
gathered together several fine human specimens, and several
of the finest snakes, and blended them in a vast spawning vat.
After a great many horrific mistakes, on which it is better not
to dwell, Sith created the creature known to the Caarth as
S'hghkull, which means 'Sacred Father of All' – the first of the
Snake People.
S'hghkull was eight feet tall, with four arms and the head of
a cobra, but little in the way of human intelligence. But Sith
was not deterred, and she soon spawned him a mate, known
to the Caarth as H'ssghkull ('Sacred Mother of All'). She was
smaller, with only two arms and the head of a viper, but much
cleverer, with both the natural cunning of a snake and the
reasoning powers of a human. Between them, S'hghkull and
H'ssghkull quickly produced several dozen offspring, and
the Caarth as a race were born. Sith transported the offspring
to the Earthly Plane, secreted them away in the hottest parts
of what were later to be called the Desert of Skulls and the
Scythera Desert, and left them to thrive.
THE CITIES OF THE SNAKE PEOPLE
More than a millennium later now, the Caarth have
constructed their own citadels, carved from the solid stone of
desert rock-formations, and established their dominance over
a wide area of the surface world. Indeed, there are not just
Caarth any more either. They have been joined by the
fearsome Justrali, the snake-tailed serpent guard, who patrol
the very edges of their domain, bringing slow, painful death
to any who dare trespass on the land of the Snake People.
In Allansia, the Snake People (a generic term for Caarth,
Justrali and other assorted snake-mutations) dwell for the
most part in large stone citadels, though every oasis in the
heart of the desert has its own small settlement of Caarth,
who usually dwell under canvas in a manner learnt from the
human nomads who dwell on the fringes of the Snake
People's territory. In Khul, all Caarth live in this way, for their
power on that continent is very small. It is their cities,
however, which most interest those who study the Snake
People.
Their main settlements are the citadels of K'rrstal ('Heart of
Glimmering Stone'), S'turrak ('Cool Providence of Shadows')
and the Caarth capital, S'hchtiss ('Jewelled Oasis of Sighing
Worship'). There are also about a dozen small fortifications
in a wide ellipse around these three citadels, each of which
houses a garrison of Caarth and Justrali warriors and little
else. The merchant Voloidon Carsak lived in the citadel of
S'turrak, but believed that the other two were much the same.
S'turrak is built into the side of a large mesa, a massive block
of stone several leagues across which rises several hundred
metres above the level of the desert. From its highest towers
it was said that one could see those of S'hchtiss glimmering
in the sunlight, many, many leagues away. Indeed, the Caarth
used to communicate with heliographs, mirrors which they
would flash in the sunlight according to specific codes,
relaying messages via the watchtowers and oases between
the cities.
The citadel of S'turrak is a bizarrely designed place, with
dozens of towers and walls, around which run many
spiralling staircases and ramps. At its base, on the desert floor,
its inhuman builders constructed a series of walls and gates
thick enough to withstand the assaults of the most determined
enemy – though none has ever attacked it. The Caarth
builders had previously bored deep into the rock behind the
citadel, to create a warren of large, cool chambers in which
their young were able to hatch in complete safety, and where
