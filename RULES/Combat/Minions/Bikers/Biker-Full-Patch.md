### Road Warrior

Biker Full Patches are skilled at operating motorcycles in combat situations. They receive +1 to SKILL when making attacks from or while operating a motorcycle.

### Intimidation

Biker Full Patches use their reputation and presence to intimidate opponents. When a full patch attempts to intimidate, they may add +1 to their SKILL for the purpose of intimidation tests or social interactions where fear is a factor.
