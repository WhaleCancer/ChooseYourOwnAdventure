# Biker Prospect

**Type:** Outlaw motorcycle club probationary member / Minion  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Biker Prospects** are probationary members trying to earn their full patch and become patched members of the club. Inspired by the eager, dangerous prospects of 1980s action movies, these bikers are willing to do anything to prove themselves, making them unpredictable and often more dangerous than full members. They're constantly trying to impress the patched members and may take unnecessary risks to demonstrate their loyalty and toughness.

## Abilities

### Eager to Prove

Biker Prospects are desperate to prove themselves. When fighting alongside patched members, they gain +1 to SKILL and +1 to damage, representing their willingness to take risks to impress.

### Reckless Abandon

Biker Prospects may take extreme risks. When reduced to half STAMINA or less, they gain +2 to damage but suffer -1 to SKILL (representing reckless aggression), as they're willing to sacrifice themselves to prove their worth.

### No Surrender

Biker Prospects will never surrender when patched members are present, as it would mean losing their chance at a patch. They fight to the death when observed by full members.

### Follow Orders

Biker Prospects must follow orders from patched members. If a patched member gives an order, the prospect will follow it even if it's dangerous or suicidal.

## In Play

Biker Prospects serve as:

- **Cannon fodder** - Sent into dangerous situations first
- **Combat encounters** - Aggressive and unpredictable opponents
- **Information sources** - May be more willing to talk if separated from patched members
- **Tactical elements** - Their eagerness can be exploited or used against them
- **Character development** - May provide opportunities for negotiation or manipulation

### Game Considerations

- Prospects are dangerous due to their eagerness to prove themselves
- They may be more willing to negotiate if separated from patched members
- Their reckless behavior makes them unpredictable
- They often appear in groups with patched members
- Their desperation can be exploited tactically
- They may provide information if they think it will help them earn their patch
