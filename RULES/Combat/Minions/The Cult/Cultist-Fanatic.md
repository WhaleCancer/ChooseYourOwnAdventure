# Cultist Fanatic

**Type:** Cult member / Minion

## Overview

**Cultist Fanatics** are the most dangerous and devoted members of dark cults, willing to sacrifice everything in service of their cause. Inspired by the most aggressive cultists of retro horror shooters, these fanatics charge into combat with reckless abandon, using melee weapons, close-range firearms, and thrown dynamite to overwhelm opponents. They are completely unafraid of death, seeing it as either a gateway to their reward or a necessary sacrifice for their cause.

## Equipment

- **Melee weapons** - Ritual knives, axes, machetes, or improvised weapons (chains, tire irons, etc.)
- **Shotguns** - [Double-barrel shotguns](../../Weapons/Canada 198X/_Ranged/Shotguns/Double-Barrel Shotgun.md) or sawed-off variants for close-range combat
- **Handguns** - Various handguns, often used at point-blank range
- **Ritual items** - Symbols, fetishes, or artifacts related to their beliefs
- **Minimal protection** - May wear ritual clothing but little actual armor, relying on fanaticism

## Abilities

### Reckless Charge

Cultist Fanatics charge into melee combat without hesitation. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +2 to damage on the first melee attack, but suffer -1 to SKILL for the purpose of defending against attacks that round.

### Death Before Dishonor

Cultist Fanatics will never surrender and fight until death. They gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying.

### Pain Immunity

Through fanaticism, drugs, or ritual preparation, Cultist Fanatics ignore pain and injury. They do not suffer penalties to SKILL when reduced to half STAMINA or less, and may push through injuries that would incapacitate normal humans.

### Suicidal Tactics

Cultist Fanatics may use themselves as weapons. When reduced to 2 STAMINA or less, they may attempt to grapple opponents and detonate dynamite (if available), or use other suicidal tactics. This attack automatically hits but kills the fanatic.

### Reckless Dynamite Throwing

Cultist Fanatics throw dynamite with reckless abandon, not caring about proper fuse timing or their own safety. They may throw dynamite as their primary attack action. When throwing dynamite, roll 1d6: on a 1-2, the fuse is too short and may explode prematurely (GM's discretion - may damage the thrower or nearby cultists); on a 5-6, the fuse is properly timed. Fanatics gain +1 to SKILL when throwing dynamite due to their complete lack of concern for safety.

## In Play

Cultist Fanatics serve as:

- **Shock troops** - Leading charges and overwhelming opponents through aggression
- **Close combat specialists** - Excelling in melee combat and close-range engagements
- **Explosive threats** - Using dynamite to destroy structures and eliminate opponents
- **Terror weapons** - Their willingness to die creates fear and uncertainty
- **Ritual sacrifices** - May be used as sacrifices in dark ceremonies
- **Elite threats** - More dangerous than regular cultists, appearing in smaller but more effective groups

### Game Considerations

- Cultist Fanatics are extremely dangerous in close combat
- Their dynamite makes them a serious threat at range as well
- Their suicidal tactics make them unpredictable and terrifying
- Their reckless dynamite throwing may harm themselves or other cultists
- They may be under the influence of drugs or supernatural forces
- Their complete lack of fear makes them difficult to intimidate or negotiate with
- They often appear during important rituals or when the cult is threatened
- Their willingness to die makes them particularly dangerous opponents
