# Harvested

**Type:** Cult victim / Minion  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**The Harvested** are unfortunate victims of the Cult's activities, captured by Harvesters to be sacrificed and experimented on. They are often found hung upside down, covered from head to toe in burlap sacks. If approached, they will unwind themselves and lurch towards potential rescuers in a delusional attempt to free themselves. However, unbeknownst to them, the Harvester has strapped explosives onto them, making them explode in proximity to others, causing devastating damage in a shower of gore and bone fragments.

## Statistics

**SKILL:** 5  
**STAMINA:** 8  
**HABITAT:** Cult compounds, abandoned buildings, secret facilities, ritual sites  
**NUMBER ENCOUNTERED:** 2-6 (1d4+1)  
**TYPE:** Human (victim)  
**REACTION:** Confused/Hostile  
**INTELLIGENCE:** Low (delusional, traumatized)

## Equipment

The Harvested carry:

- **Explosive rigging** - Dynamite or other explosives strapped to their body by Harvesters, typically 3-5 sticks, with proximity or remote detonation
- **Burlap sack** - Covers them from head to toe, initially hung upside down
- **No weapons** - They are victims, not combatants

## Abilities

### Unwitting Suicide Bomber

The Harvested do not know they are rigged to explode. They will lurch towards anyone who approaches, believing they are being rescued. When a Harvested comes within Short range of any living being (including other Harvested), roll 1d6: on a 1-3, the explosives detonate immediately. On a 4-6, they continue moving but will detonate on the next proximity check.

### Proximity Detonation

When the Harvested explodes, it deals 5-9 damage (GM's choice or roll 1d5+4) to all targets within Short range. The Harvested is automatically killed in a shower of gore and bone fragments. The explosion can destroy cover, damage vehicles, and breach structures.

### Chain Reaction

If multiple Harvested are grouped together (within Short range of each other), killing or detonating one may cause a chain reaction. When a Harvested explodes, roll 1d6 for each other Harvested within Short range: on a 1-2, that Harvested also detonates immediately, potentially creating a devastating chain reaction.

### Delusional Behavior

The Harvested are traumatized and delusional. They do not recognize threats and will move towards any living being, believing they are being rescued. They cannot be reasoned with or warned about the explosives. They gain +1 to SKILL for the purpose of moving towards targets (representing their desperate lurching), but suffer -2 to SKILL for any defensive actions.

### Traumatized State

The Harvested have been subjected to horrific experiments and trauma. They do not fight back with weapons - they only move towards others, believing they are being saved. They may make desperate, uncoordinated attacks if grappled or restrained, but these are weak and ineffective (treat as unarmed combat with -3 to damage).

## In Play

The Harvested serve as tragic, horrifying proximity-based explosive threats. They are unwitting suicide bombers who don't know they're rigged to explode. They should be fought at range using precision weapons with abundant ammunition, as close-range combat is extremely dangerous. Their chain reaction potential makes them particularly deadly when encountered in groups.
