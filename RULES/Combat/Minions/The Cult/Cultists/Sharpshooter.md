# Sharpshooter

**Type:** Cult member / Minion (Elite)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Sharpshooters** are the snipers of the Cult, professionally trained marksmen identifiable by their green combat fatigues. These elite enemies are dangerous due to their primary weapon, the Lee-Enfield rifle, being able to hit opponents from across the map with deadly accuracy. At close range, they swap out with a handgun sidearm that is no less deadly in the hands of a sniper.

Fortunately, they are always found on watchtowers and rarely move, making counter-sniper tactics relatively easy against them. Moreover, their sniper rifles reflect a noticeable glint from their scope, making them even more identifiable.

- **Rifle scope** - High-powered scope that reflects noticeable glint, making them identifiable

- **Green combat fatigues** - Military-style clothing that makes them identifiable

## Abilities

### Long-Range Precision

Sharpshooters are deadly accurate at extreme distances. When using their sniper rifle, they gain +3 to SKILL for ranged attacks at Medium or Long range. They can hit opponents from across the map with accuracy, making them extremely dangerous at long range. The sniper rifle deals high damage and can eliminate opponents with a single well-placed shot.

### Scope Glint

Sharpshooters' sniper rifles reflect a noticeable glint from their scope, making them easily identifiable. Opponents who are actively searching for snipers may spot the glint with a successful Perception or Awareness test, even at long range. This makes counter-sniper tactics easier, as the Sharpshooter's position is revealed.

### Stationary Position

Sharpshooters are always found on watchtowers and rarely move. This makes them predictable targets for counter-sniper operations. However, their elevated position provides them with:

- **Superior field of view** - Can see opponents at long range
- **Cover advantage** - Watchtower provides protection
- **Height advantage** - +1 to SKILL for ranged attacks due to elevation

The Sharpshooter will only move if forced to (e.g., watchtower is destroyed, they are directly attacked at close range).

### Weapon Swap

At close range, Sharpshooters swap out their sniper rifle for a handgun sidearm. When within Short range, they automatically switch to their handgun. The handgun is no less deadly in the hands of a sniper - they gain +2 to SKILL when using handguns due to their professional training and precision.

### Professional Training

Sharpshooters are professionally trained marksmen. They gain +1 to SKILL for all ranged attacks and understand ballistics, windage, and elevation. They can make precision shots that would be impossible for untrained shooters.

### Watchtower Defense

Sharpshooters positioned on watchtowers are difficult to approach. The watchtower provides:

- **Elevated position** - Harder to hit from below
- **Cover** - Watchtower structure provides protection
- **Early warning** - Can spot approaching opponents at long range

Opponents attacking from below suffer -1 to SKILL when attacking the Sharpshooter in the watchtower.

### Fanatical Devotion

Sharpshooters are completely devoted to their cause. They fight to the death and will never surrender. They gain +1 to SKILL when fighting in defense of cult leaders or important ritual sites.

### Regular Health

Despite their elite status, Sharpshooters have the same health as regular Cultists (STAMINA: 9). They gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, but are not as resilient as other elite enemies. This makes them vulnerable to counter-sniper operations.

## In Play

Sharpshooters serve as:

- **Long-range threats** - Deadly accurate at extreme distances
- **Overwatch** - Providing covering fire from elevated positions
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their threat level
- **Counter-sniper opportunities** - Their stationary position makes them predictable targets

### Game Considerations

- Sharpshooters are extremely dangerous at long range - avoid open areas when they are present
- Their scope glint makes them identifiable - use this to locate them
- They are always found on watchtowers and rarely move - use this to plan counter-sniper operations
- Long-ranged precision weapons (lever-action rifle, FG-42, bolt-action rifle) are excellent against them
- They possess the same health as regular Cultists - precision shots can eliminate them quickly
- While not the most practical, you can sneak up to their watchtowers and eliminate them at close range
- At close range, shotguns or SASG should be more than enough
- Their handgun sidearm is no less deadly - don't underestimate them at close range
- They often appear in very small numbers (1-2) but represent a significant threat
- They may be protecting important cult leaders or ritual sites
- Their green combat fatigues make them easily identifiable
- They drop 3 sniper rounds upon death
