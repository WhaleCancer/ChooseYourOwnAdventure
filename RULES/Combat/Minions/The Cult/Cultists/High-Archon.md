# High Archon

**Type:** Cult leader / Boss  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**The High Archon** is the final boss in Chapter Two - the highest ranked member of the Cult in Chapter Two, even more so than the Conjurer. The High Archon sits in a position equivalent of the Cult's executive class. As a human, he wears an elaborate light blue gilded robe and only appears in cutscenes. He is arrogant, smug, and megalomaniacal and treats opponents with disdain.

However, this changes once he fuses with the "Heart", which transforms and ascends him to demonhood. Now possessing godlike powers, he would then challenge opponents on a one-on-one duel. He is largely a close-combat monster, hitting fast and hard, making him a formidable foe to fight against, especially when he does his grab attacks. Even when trying to fight him at range, be aware that he will shoot out a demonic beam to hit opponents. To make matters worse, he covers himself in an energy barrier as 'armor', which requires opponents to bring it down before actually harming him.

## Abilities

### Godlike Powers

The High Archon possesses godlike powers after fusing with the "Heart" and ascending to demonhood. He gains +3 to SKILL for all actions and +5 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when he falls unconscious. He may continue fighting for three additional rounds after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying, representing his godlike resilience.

### Energy Barrier Armor

The High Archon covers himself in an energy barrier as 'armor', which requires opponents to bring it down before actually harming him. The energy barrier:

- **Provides protection** - The High Archon gains +6 to STAMINA against all attacks while the barrier is active
- **Must be brought down** - Opponents must deal damage to the barrier before harming the High Archon himself
- **Rapid-fire vulnerability** - Rapid-firing weapons (STEN, Handgun, Maxim Gun) are more effective at bringing down the barrier
- **Regenerates** - The barrier may regenerate if not constantly damaged (GM's discretion)

The barrier has its own STAMINA pool (typically 15-20 points) that must be depleted before the High Archon can be harmed.

### Close-Combat Monster

The High Archon is largely a close-combat monster, hitting fast and hard. When attacking in melee, he gains +3 to damage and may make an additional attack every other round, representing his speed and power. His attacks are fast and difficult to avoid - opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when defending against melee attacks.

### Grab Attacks

The High Archon's grab attacks are particularly dangerous. When he successfully hits with a melee attack, roll 1d6: on a 4-6, he grabs the opponent. While grabbed:

- **Crushing damage** - The opponent suffers 3-5 damage per round
- **Immobilization** - The opponent cannot move or take most actions
- **Break free** - The opponent must make a SKILL or PHYSICAL test (GM's choice) to break free
- **High damage** - The grab deals significant damage, making him a formidable foe

### Demonic Beam

Even when trying to fight the High Archon at range, be aware that he will shoot out a demonic beam to hit opponents. This is a ranged attack with Medium/Long range that deals 5-8 damage. The demonic beam is fast and difficult to dodge - opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when attempting to dodge. The High Archon may use this ability once per round.

### Fast and Hard Hitting

The High Archon hits fast and hard. He gains +2 to SKILL for the purpose of movement and closing distance. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, he gains +4 to damage on the first attack, representing his speed and power.

### One-on-One Duel

The High Archon challenges opponents to one-on-one duels. He will focus on a single opponent and fight them directly. This makes him extremely dangerous, as he can concentrate all his power on a single target.

### Ascended Demon

The High Archon has fused with the "Heart" and transformed to demonhood. He is immune to fear effects, cannot be intimidated or negotiated with, and possesses supernatural resilience. He may have access to additional demonic abilities at the GM's discretion.

### Boss Status

The High Archon is a boss and should be treated as such. He has access to multiple combat options and represents the ultimate challenge. He will use his energy barrier, grab attacks, and demonic beam to overwhelm opponents.

## In Play

The High Archon serves as:

- **Final boss** - The ultimate challenge of Chapter Two
- **One-on-one duelist** - Challenges opponents to direct combat
- **Close-combat threat** - Extremely dangerous in melee
- **Range threat** - Can attack at range with demonic beams
- **Protected enemy** - Energy barrier must be brought down first

### Game Considerations

- The High Archon is the final boss - fight him with extreme caution
- Due to his multitude of close-combat attacks, it is advised to fight him with hard-hitting long-range precision weapons
- The Revolver, Lever-Action Rifle, FG-42, and Bolt Action Rifle are suitable for this
- If he has his 'shields' up (energy barrier), then rapid-firing weapons like the STEN, Handgun, and Maxim Gun would be more appropriate
- At medium-range, explosives like the Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, TNT Bundle, and Molotov Cocktail would be preferable
- In the unfortunate case of him closing up on opponents, swap out to Shotgun, SASG, and Incinerator to deal high damage and offer some knockback
- His energy barrier must be brought down before actually harming him - focus fire on the barrier first
- His grab attacks are particularly dangerous - avoid getting caught in melee if possible
- His demonic beam makes him dangerous at range - maintain distance but be prepared to dodge
- He is largely a close-combat monster - keep your distance when possible
- He challenges opponents to one-on-one duels - be prepared for a direct confrontation
- He possesses godlike powers - don't underestimate his abilities
- He often appears alone but represents a catastrophic threat
- He may be protecting the "Heart" or other important cult artifacts
- His ascended demon form makes him easily identifiable
- He is the highest ranked member of the Cult in Chapter Two - defeating him is a major victory
