## Abilities

### Fanatical Devotion

Dynamite Cultists fight to the death and will not surrender. They gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious.

Dynamite Cultists throw dynamite with reckless abandon. When throwing dynamite, roll 1d6: on a 1-2, the fuse is too short and may explode prematurely (GM's discretion); on a 5-6, the fuse is properly timed.

## In Play

Dynamite Cultists serve as explosive threats, using dynamite to destroy structures and eliminate opponents. They're dangerous and unpredictable, often appearing in smaller numbers due to the risk of their weapons.
