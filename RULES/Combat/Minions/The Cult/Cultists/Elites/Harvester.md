# Harvester

**Type:** Cult member / Miniboss  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Harvesters** are elite minibosses responsible for kidnapping multiple innocent people to be Harvested. They are serial killers created or recruited by the Cult, large, imposing figures that can take multiple TNT bundles to the face and keep on charging. Incredibly aggressive, their primary weapon is a chainsaw that can deal significant damage to both health and armor. They are not helpless at range either, for they can throw a meat hook to drag opponents closer into their chainsaw, lay bear traps to immobilize opponents so they can rush up towards them, or throw fragmentation grenades to flush opponents out of cover. Harvesters should be treated with extreme caution - even one of them is a proven challenge.

Harvesters wear butcher attire and favor chainsaws, a clear reference to Leatherface, while their skull-like mask is a homage to Jason Voorhees. They are the most common type of miniboss found in cult operations.

While most Harvesters are created or recruited by the Cult, there is also the possibility of independent Harvesters - serial killers who operate on their own, inspired by slasher movie villains like those from Friday the 13th, Halloween, and similar horror franchises. These independent Harvesters may have their own motivations and methods, but share the same brutal efficiency and terrifying presence as their Cult-created counterparts.

## Abilities

### Chainsaw Mastery

Harvesters are masters of the chainsaw, using it to devastating effect. When attacking with the chainsaw, they gain +2 to damage and the chainsaw deals damage to both health (STAMINA) and armor. The chainsaw can destroy armor, reducing an opponent's protection. At close range, the chainsaw is extremely dangerous - opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when defending against chainsaw attacks.

### Incredible Resilience

Harvesters can take enormous amounts of punishment. They gain +5 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for two additional rounds after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They can survive multiple TNT bundles, headshots from lever-action rifles, and other attacks that would instantly kill normal enemies (treat as normal damage instead).

### Aggressive Charge

Harvesters charge into combat with incredible aggression. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +3 to damage on the first chainsaw attack, but suffer -1 to SKILL for the purpose of defending against attacks that round. Their charge is intimidating - opponents must make a Willpower test or suffer -1 to SKILL for the first round of combat when facing a Harvester.

### Meat Hook Throw

Harvesters can throw a meat hook to drag opponents closer. This is a ranged attack with Short/Medium range. If the attack hits, the opponent is pulled into melee range and suffers 2-4 damage. The opponent must make a SKILL test to avoid being pulled, or they are dragged into chainsaw range. The Harvester may use this ability once per round.

### Bear Trap Placement

Harvesters can lay bear traps to immobilize opponents. The Harvester may place a bear trap as an action. If an opponent steps on the bear trap, they must make a LUCK test or be immobilized (cannot move) and suffer 2-3 damage per round until freed. The bear trap can be disarmed with a Trap Knowledge skill test or destroyed with an attack. The Harvester may carry 2-3 bear traps.

### Fragmentation Grenade Throw

Harvesters can throw fragmentation grenades to flush opponents out of cover. This is a ranged attack with Short/Medium range. The grenade deals 4-7 damage (area of effect) to all targets within Short range of the impact point. The Harvester may use this ability once every other round. The grenade can destroy cover and flush opponents out of hiding.

### Butcher's Armor

Harvesters wear butcher attire that provides protection. They gain +3 to STAMINA against all attacks, representing their thick protective clothing and physical resilience. The armor is vulnerable to fire damage, which bypasses some of the protection.

### Miniboss Status

Harvesters are minibosses and should be treated as such. They have access to multiple combat options and can adapt their tactics based on the situation. They will use their ranged weapons to control the battlefield before closing in with the chainsaw.

### Serial Killer Origins

Harvesters are serial killers created or recruited by the Cult. They may have been:

- **Created by the Cult** - Transformed or enhanced through dark magic or rituals
- **Recruited by the Cult** - Existing serial killers who have been brought into the Cult's service
- **Independent operators** - Serial killers who operate on their own, inspired by slasher movie villains (Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc.)

Independent Harvesters may have their own motivations and methods, but share the same brutal efficiency and terrifying presence as their Cult-created counterparts. They may be drawn to the Cult's activities or operate in parallel, creating their own mayhem while the Cult conducts its rituals.

## In Play

Harvesters serve as:

- **Miniboss encounters** - Significant challenges that require careful tactics
- **Kidnappers** - Responsible for capturing victims to be Harvested
- **Close-range threats** - Extremely dangerous with the chainsaw
- **Battlefield controllers** - Use bear traps and grenades to control positioning
- **High-priority targets** - Must be eliminated to stop kidnapping operations

### Game Considerations

- Harvesters are minibosses and should be fought with extreme caution
- Their chainsaw is devastating at close range - avoid melee combat if possible
- Long-range, precision, or explosive weapons are ideal tools to bring them down
- Headshots from lever-action rifles, revolvers, bolt-action rifles, or grenade launchers are effective
- TNT bundles are effective but may require multiple hits
- Shorter-ranged weapons should be avoided unless in emergencies
- Constantly strafe around them and dodge their attacks, especially the meat hook
- Bear traps should be shot at or avoided - they can immobilize opponents
- Fragmentation grenades should be avoided - they can flush opponents out of cover
- Their incredible resilience means they can take enormous punishment
- They often appear alone but represent a catastrophic threat
- They may be protecting kidnapping operations or important cult sites
- Their skull mask and butcher attire make them easily identifiable
