# Immolator

**Type:** Cult member / Minion (Elite)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Immolators** (also called Incinerators) are among the most dangerous Cultist variants, carrying the much-feared Incinerator flamethrowers and clad in bullet-proof and flame-proof dark brown jackets with gas masks. The high damage from their flamethrowers combined with their high health ensures that Immolators are a threat that can rival even minibosses on their own right. They are uncommon elite enemies that represent a significant challenge.

Upon death, Immolators have a chance to drop napalm tanks, which can be used as explosive weapons.

## Abilities

### Flamethrower Mastery

Immolators are masters of the flamethrower, using it to devastating effect. They have three modes of attack:

**Traditional Fire Arc:** The Immolator shoots flames in an arc, causing immense fire damage (5-8 damage) to whatever it hits. This is their primary attack mode, effective at Short/Medium range. The fire continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round until extinguished.

**Beam Fire:** The Immolator shoots flames over several lines like a beam. Whilst not as damaging (3-5 damage), it is far more difficult to avoid. Opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when attempting to dodge beam fire attacks. The beam can hit multiple targets in a line.

**Grenade Launcher (Alt-Fire):** The Immolator uses the Incinerator's alt-fire as a grenade launcher, flushing opponents out of cover. This attack deals 4-6 damage (area of effect) to all targets within Short range of the impact point. The Immolator may use this ability once every other round.

### Flame-Proof Protection

Immolators wear flame-proof dark brown jackets that make them completely immune to fire damage. They take no damage from Incinerators, Molotov cocktails, flare guns, or any other fire-based attacks. This makes them extremely difficult to fight with fire weapons.

### Bullet-Proof Armor

Immolators wear bullet-proof jackets that provide significant protection. They gain +3 to STAMINA against ranged attacks, and the armor may stop low-damage attacks entirely (GM's discretion). The armor is vulnerable to precision shots targeting their weak spot (napalm tanks).

### High Health

Immolators have high health that rivals minibosses. They gain +4 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They can survive attacks that would kill normal cultists.

### Napalm Tank Weak Spot

Immolators have a giant weak spot: their napalm tanks. Using a precision weapon (handgun, revolver, lever-action rifle, FG-42, bolt-action rifle) to hit the tanks can ignite them, causing a massive explosion. If the tanks are hit with a precision shot (aimed attack targeting the tanks), roll 1d6: on a 4-6, the tanks explode, dealing 8-12 damage (area of effect) to the Immolator and all targets within Short range. The Immolator is automatically killed by the explosion. This is the easiest way to kill an Immolator, but it requires precision and puts the attacker at risk of the explosion.

### Fanatical Devotion

Immolators are completely devoted to their cause. They fight to the death and will never surrender. They gain +1 to SKILL when fighting in defense of cult leaders or important ritual sites.

### Gas Mask Protection

Immolators wear gas masks that protect against chemical agents and obscure their identity. They are immune to gas attacks and chemical weapons.

## In Play

Immolators serve as:

- **Elite fire threats** - The cult's most dangerous fire-based combatants
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their threat level
- **Miniboss-level threats** - Can rival minibosses in danger
- **Cover-flushing specialists** - Use grenade launcher to force opponents out of hiding
- **Area denial** - Their flamethrowers can control large areas

### Game Considerations

- Immolators are extremely dangerous and should be fought with extreme caution
- They are completely immune to fire damage - Incinerators and Molotov cocktails are useless against them
- Shotguns and SASG are too risky due to flamethrower range
- Precision weapons (handgun, revolver, lever-action rifle, FG-42, bolt-action rifle) targeting their napalm tanks are the ideal way to kill them
- Hitting the napalm tanks causes a massive explosion that kills the Immolator and anyone nearby
- Their flamethrower has three attack modes - traditional arc (high damage), beam (hard to dodge), and grenade launcher (flushes out of cover)
- Their high health means they can take significant punishment
- They often appear in very small numbers (1-2) but represent a catastrophic threat
- They may be protecting important cult leaders or ritual sites
- Their dark brown jackets and gas masks make them easily identifiable
- Upon death, they may drop napalm tanks that can be used as explosive weapons
