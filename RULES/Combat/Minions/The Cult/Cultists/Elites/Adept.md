- **German MP40** - [[../../Weapons/Canada 198X/_Ranged/SMGs/Heavy SMG|German MP40 submachine gun]] in the other hand

- **Backup weapons** - Handguns or melee weapons as secondary options

## Abilities

### Dual-Wielding Mastery

Cultist Adepts can fire both MP40s effectively, unleashing devastating close to medium-range firepower. When dual-wielding, they gain +2 to damage at Short range and +1 to damage at Medium range, but suffer -1 to SKILL when using both weapons in the same round (representing the difficulty of managing two weapons). The dual MP40s provide overwhelming firepower that can suppress and eliminate opponents quickly.

### Tactical Positioning

Cultist Adepts can go prone, making them harder to hit. When prone, opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when attacking them at Medium or Long range, but the Adept suffers -1 to SKILL for the purpose of attacking while prone.

### Explosive Evasion

Cultist Adepts can dive to avoid explosives. When an explosive (dynamite, grenade, etc.) is thrown or detonated near them, they may make a LUCK test. On success, they dive to safety, taking only half damage from the explosion. This ability can only be used once per combat encounter.

### Elite Resilience

Cultist Adepts are incredibly tough and can survive attacks that would kill normal cultists. They gain +3 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They can survive headshots from lever-action rifles or shotguns that would normally be instantly fatal (treat as normal damage instead).

### Armored Protection

Cultist Adepts wear bulletproof armor that provides significant protection. They gain +2 to STAMINA against ranged attacks, and the armor may stop low-damage attacks entirely (GM's discretion). The armor is vulnerable to fire damage, which bypasses some of the protection.

### Fanatical Devotion

Despite their elite status, Cultist Adepts are still completely devoted to their cause. They fight to the death and will never surrender. They gain +1 to SKILL when fighting in defense of cult leaders or important ritual sites.

### Fire Vulnerability

While their armor protects against bullets, it is vulnerable to fire. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), the Adept takes full damage and the fire continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round until extinguished. The fire also weakens the armor's protection.

## In Play

Cultist Adepts serve as:

- **Elite combatants** - The cult's most dangerous fighters
- **Tactical threats** - Using advanced combat techniques
- **Dual-weapon specialists** - Combining overwhelming firepower with tactical skill
- **Resilient opponents** - Surviving attacks that would kill normal cultists
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their threat level

### Game Considerations

- Cultist Adepts are extremely dangerous and should be fought with high-damage weapons
- Aiming for headshots with lever-action rifles or shotguns is effective but won't instantly kill them
- Fire damage is particularly effective against them, bypassing their armor
- Their dual MP40s make them extremely dangerous at both medium and close range, unleashing overwhelming firepower
- Their ability to go prone makes them harder to hit at range
- They often appear in small numbers but represent a significant threat
- They may be protecting important cult leaders or ritual sites
- Their gas masks make them immune to chemical agents and obscure their identity
