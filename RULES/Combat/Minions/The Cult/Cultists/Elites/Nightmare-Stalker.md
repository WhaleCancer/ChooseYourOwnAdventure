# Nightmare Stalker

**Type:** Cult member / Independent / Minion (Elite, Psionic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Nightmare Stalkers** are psionic predators who have transcended normal human limitations through dark magic, trauma, or forbidden knowledge. Inspired by the legendary figure of Freddy Krueger, these terrifying entities can invade dreams and manipulate nightmares, making them extremely dangerous opponents. 

Nightmare Stalkers may be cult-affiliated, having awakened their powers through the Cult's dark rituals, or they may be independent entities who gained their abilities through other means - perhaps through extreme trauma, near-death experiences, or encounters with otherworldly forces. Regardless of their origin, they are all united by their ability to enter dreams and their burning hatred for the living.

## Abilities

### Dream Invasion

Nightmare Stalkers can enter the dreams and nightmares of sleeping victims. When a victim is asleep within Medium range of a Nightmare Stalker, the Stalker may attempt to enter their dream. The victim must make a Willpower test. On failure, the Stalker enters the dream and gains +3 to SKILL and +2 to damage against the victim while in the dream. In dreams, the Stalker is nearly invincible - they can only be truly harmed if the victim realizes they are dreaming and gains control, or if the victim is woken by external means.

### Reality Blur

Nightmare Stalkers can blur the line between dreams and reality. When active, they may cause opponents to experience dream-like effects even while awake. Opponents must make a Willpower test or suffer -2 to SKILL, as reality becomes unstable and dream-like. The Stalker may use this ability once per round, affecting all opponents within Short range.

### Razor Glove Mastery

Nightmare Stalkers wield a distinctive clawed glove with razors or blades. When attacking with the razor glove, they gain +3 to damage and may cause severe bleeding. When a Stalker hits with the razor glove, roll 1d6: on a 4-6, the opponent suffers 2 points of additional damage per round from bleeding until treated. The razor glove can tear through flesh and even reality itself in dreams.

### Psychological Terror

Nightmare Stalkers use fear and psychological terror as weapons. When an opponent first encounters a Nightmare Stalker, they must make a Willpower test. On failure, they suffer -2 to SKILL for the first three rounds of combat, as the Stalker's horrifying appearance and dark presence overwhelms them. The Stalker may taunt opponents with dark humor, making them even more unnerving.

### Dark Humor and Taunting

Nightmare Stalkers taunt their victims with cruel wit and dark humor. They may make taunting remarks that can distract and unnerve opponents. Opponents must make a Willpower test or suffer -1 to SKILL when the Stalker taunts them, as their psychological warfare takes effect.

### Psionic Mastery

Nightmare Stalkers have awakened their psychic powers through dark magic, trauma, or forbidden knowledge. They are immune to normal fear effects and may use their psionic abilities even when reduced to low STAMINA. They gain +2 to SKILL when using psionic abilities.

### Ascended Resilience

Nightmare Stalkers have transcended normal human limitations. They gain +3 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for two additional rounds after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. Their psionic nature and undead-like state make them resistant to normal physical attacks.

### Fire Vulnerability

Despite their burned appearance, Nightmare Stalkers are extremely vulnerable to fire. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), they take triple damage and suffer -3 to SKILL for all abilities for the next round, as the fire triggers traumatic memories of their death. Fire is the most effective weapon against them, representing their greatest weakness.

### Dream-Enhanced Power

In dreams or when reality is blurred, Nightmare Stalkers are significantly more powerful. They gain +4 to SKILL, +3 to damage, and +5 to STAMINA when operating in dream space or when their Reality Blur ability is active. This makes them nearly invincible in dreams, where they can only be defeated by victims who realize they are dreaming or by being woken.

### Independent or Cult-Affiliated

Nightmare Stalkers may be cult-affiliated, having awakened their powers through the Cult's dark rituals, or they may be independent entities who gained their abilities through other means. Independent Stalkers may have their own motivations and methods, but share the same terrifying abilities and appearance. They may be drawn to the Cult's activities or operate in parallel, creating their own mayhem while the Cult conducts its rituals.
