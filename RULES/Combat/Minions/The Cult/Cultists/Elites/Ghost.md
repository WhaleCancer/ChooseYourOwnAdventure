# Cultist Ghost

**Type:** Cult member / Minion (Elite, Psionic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Cultist Ghosts** are ascended members of the Cult who have awakened their psychic powers through dark magic. These elite cultists use their minds to hurt and kill opponents, making them unconventional but extremely dangerous enemies. Identifiable by the fact that they levitate and wear a drape of white cloth over themselves, Ghosts are psionic threats that must be taken out immediately. They represent the pinnacle of the Cult's dark rituals, having transcended normal human limitations through forbidden knowledge.

## Characteristics

Cultist Ghosts are:

- **Ascended cultists** - Have transcended normal human limitations through dark magic
- **Psionic** - Possess awakened psychic powers
- **Levitating** - Float above the ground, making them difficult to target
- **Mysterious** - Wrapped in white cloth, their true form obscured
- **Dangerous** - Use their minds as weapons
- **Elite** - Represent the pinnacle of the Cult's power

## Equipment

Cultist Ghosts typically carry:

- **White cloth drape** - Covers them from head to toe, obscuring their identity
- **No physical weapons** - They rely entirely on their psionic abilities
- **Ritual items** - Symbols, fetishes, or artifacts related to their dark magic
- **Minimal protection** - The white cloth provides no real armor, but their levitation makes them harder to hit

## Abilities

### Levitation

Cultist Ghosts float above the ground, making them difficult to target. Opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when attacking them with melee weapons, and -1 to SKILL when attacking them with ranged weapons. The Ghost's levitation also allows them to move over obstacles and difficult terrain without penalty.

### Telekinesis Attack

Cultist Ghosts can grab random objects with their mind and throw them at opponents with sufficient velocity. This is their primary attack method. The Ghost may target any object within Medium range (debris, furniture, tools, etc.) and hurl it at an opponent. This attack deals 3-6 damage (GM's choice or roll 1d4+2) and has a range of Short/Medium. The Ghost gains +1 to SKILL when using telekinesis attacks due to their mastery of the ability.

### Psychokinesis Attack

Cultist Ghosts can use a more esoteric psychokinesis attack that saps an opponent's strength. When an opponent looks directly at the Ghost, they must make a Willpower test. On failure, the opponent suffers -2 to SKILL and -1 to STAMINA (temporary, representing drained strength) for the duration of the combat encounter. This effect can stack if the opponent fails multiple Willpower tests. The Ghost may use this ability once per round as an action, and it affects all opponents who can see the Ghost.

### Psionic Mastery

Cultist Ghosts have awakened their psychic powers through dark magic. They are immune to normal fear effects and may use their psionic abilities even when reduced to low STAMINA. They gain +2 to SKILL when using psionic abilities.

### Ascended Resilience

Cultist Ghosts have transcended normal human limitations. They gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. Their psionic nature makes them resistant to normal physical attacks.

### Dark Magic Protection

Cultist Ghosts are protected by the dark magic that awakened their powers. They gain +1 to STAMINA against all attacks, representing their supernatural resilience. However, they are vulnerable to fire damage, which disrupts their psionic connection.

### Fire Vulnerability

While Cultist Ghosts are resistant to normal attacks, fire disrupts their psionic connection. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), the Ghost takes full damage and suffers -2 to SKILL for all psionic abilities for the next round, as the fire disrupts their concentration.

## In Play

Cultist Ghosts serve as:

- **Elite psionic threats** - The Cult's most dangerous psionic enemies
- **Unconventional opponents** - Using their minds as weapons rather than physical arms
- **High-priority targets** - Must be eliminated immediately due to their threat level
- **Mysterious enemies** - Their true nature obscured by white cloth and levitation
- **Ascended cultists** - Representing the pinnacle of the Cult's dark power

### Game Considerations

- Cultist Ghosts are extremely dangerous and should be prioritized as targets
- Their levitation makes them difficult to hit, especially in melee
- Their telekinesis attacks can use any object in the environment as a weapon
- Their psychokinesis attack can weaken opponents, making them vulnerable to other enemies
- Fire damage is particularly effective against them, disrupting their psionic abilities
- They often appear in very small numbers (1-2) but represent a catastrophic threat
- They may be protecting important cult leaders or ritual sites
- Their white cloth drape makes them easily identifiable but obscures their true form
- They should be fought at range when possible, as their levitation makes melee combat difficult
