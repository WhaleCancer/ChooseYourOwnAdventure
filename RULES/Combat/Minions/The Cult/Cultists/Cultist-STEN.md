# STEN Cultist

**Type:** Cult member / Minion  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**STEN Cultists** are cult members who favor the Sten SMG for its availability from surplus sources and lower cost compared to other heavy submachine guns. These acolytes use the Sten as their primary weapon, drawn to its distinctive side-mounted magazine and historical association with Commonwealth military forces. While the Thompson is particularly favored by cultists for its "ritual significance," the Sten is more commonly encountered among rank-and-file cultists who lack access to the more expensive Thompson.
