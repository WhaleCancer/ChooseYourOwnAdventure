# Conjurer

**Type:** Cult leader / NPC (Non-combatant)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**The Conjurer** is a very rare elite enemy in CULTIC - only one is encountered in the game and is treated more like a character. Nothing more than an old man in blue robes, the Conjurer, whilst a non-combatant, is responsible for constructing the mass sacrifice ritual to summon the Abomination. You only encounter him in The Excavation Site, where he just states "It is done...", before being ripped apart by the Abomination.

The Conjurer is the only enemy that cannot be fought, as he is a 'cutscene' exclusive character who is there to conjure the black magic needed to summon the real boss of Chapter 1, the Abomination. It is presumed he is responsible for most of the mayhem of Chapter 1. As he is in charge of the Abomination ritual, he is assumed to be one of the highest ranked members of the Cult's theocracy.
