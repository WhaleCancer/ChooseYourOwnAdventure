# Shield Cultist (Hatchet)

**Type:** Cult member / Minion (Basic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Shield Cultists** are basic enemies in CULTIC that act as the living bulwark of the Cult. These cultists carry protective wall shields that make ranged weapons ineffective from the front, forcing opponents to find creative ways to eliminate them. Shield Cultists are much slower than their non-shielded brethren and are always the first in the frontlines, using their shields to protect other cultists behind them.

**Hatchet Shield Cultists** are Shield Cultists armed with hatchets for close-range combat. When their shield is up, they cannot be damaged by ranged weapons from the front, however, they can still be damaged normally from the sides and behind. Well-placed headshots ignore their shields. Their shields have limited HP and can be destroyed, at which point they become identical to regular Hatchet Cultists.

## Characteristics

Shield Cultists (Hatchet) are:

- **Basic enemies** - Common cult members, not elite
- **Living bulwarks** - Act as frontline protection for other cultists
- **Slower** - Much slower than non-shielded cultists
- **Shield-protected** - Cannot be damaged by ranged weapons from the front
- **Hatchet-wielding** - Armed with hatchets for close-range combat
- **Vulnerable from sides/behind** - Can be damaged normally from angles
- **Headshot vulnerable** - Well-placed headshots ignore shields

## Equipment

Shield Cultists (Hatchet) typically carry:

- **Wall shield** - Large protective shield that blocks ranged attacks from the front
- **Hatchet** - [[../../Weapons/Canada 198X/_Melee/axes/hatchet|Hatchet]] for close-range combat
- **Ritual items** - Symbols, fetishes, or artifacts related to their beliefs
- **Minimal protection** - Basic clothing, relying on shield for protection

## Abilities

### Wall Shield Protection

Shield Cultists carry large wall shields that provide protection from the front. When the shield is raised:

- **Frontal immunity** - Cannot be damaged by ranged weapons from the front
- **Side vulnerability** - Can be damaged normally from the sides
- **Rear vulnerability** - Can be damaged normally from behind
- **Headshot bypass** - Well-placed headshots ignore the shield entirely
- **Limited HP** - The shield has its own STAMINA pool (typically 8-12 points) that must be depleted before the shield is destroyed

Once the shield is destroyed, the Shield Cultist becomes identical to a regular Hatchet Cultist.

### Slower Movement

Shield Cultists are much slower than their non-shielded brethren due to the weight and bulk of their shields. They suffer -2 to SKILL for the purpose of movement and closing distance. This makes them easier to outmaneuver, but they compensate by always being first in the frontlines.

### Frontline Position

Shield Cultists are always the first in the frontlines, using their shields to protect other cultists behind them. They gain +1 to SKILL when defending against attacks that would hit cultists behind them, representing their role as living bulwarks.

### Hatchet Combat

Shield Cultists (Hatchet) are armed with hatchets for close-range combat. When attacking with the hatchet, they gain +1 to damage at Short range. They are dangerous in melee, but their slow movement makes it difficult for them to close distance.

### Shield Destruction

The shield has limited HP and can be destroyed. When the shield's STAMINA is reduced to 0, it is destroyed and the Shield Cultist becomes identical to a regular Hatchet Cultist. The shield can be destroyed by:

- **Sustained fire** - Multiple hits will eventually destroy the shield
- **Explosives** - Area-of-effect weapons bypass the shield entirely
- **Fire** - Fire damage bypasses the shield entirely
- **Point-blank shotgun blasts** - One or two point-blank shotgun blasts can destroy the shield (extremely risky tactic)

### Area-of-Effect Vulnerability

Shield Cultists are extremely vulnerable to area-of-effect weapons, which completely bypass their shields. Fire weapons (Molotov Cocktails, Incinerators) and explosive weapons (TNT Bundles, Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers) ignore the shield entirely, making them die just as easily as any other cultist when hit by these weapons.

### Precision Headshot Vulnerability

Well-placed headshots ignore the shield entirely. Precision weapons like the Lever-Action Rifle, FG-42, and Bolt Action Rifle can headshot Shield Cultists despite their shields, though this is tricky due to the small hitbox of their partially covered heads. The Revolver is particularly effective, as it can punch through shields and pop off their heads.

### Fanatical Devotion

Shield Cultists fight to the death and will not surrender. They gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, representing their willingness to push beyond normal limits.

## In Play

Shield Cultists (Hatchet) serve as:

- **Frontline protection** - Living bulwarks that protect other cultists
- **Ranged weapon counters** - Force opponents to use alternative tactics
- **Close-range threats** - Dangerous with hatchets in melee
- **Tactical obstacles** - Require creative solutions to eliminate

### Game Considerations

- Shield Cultists are basic enemies but require special tactics to eliminate
- Their shields make ranged weapons ineffective from the front - use area-of-effect weapons or flank them
- Fire weapons (Molotov Cocktails, Incinerators) completely bypass shields - extremely effective
- Explosive weapons (TNT Bundles, Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers) completely bypass shields - extremely effective
- Precision weapons (Lever-Action Rifle, FG-42, Bolt Action Rifle) can headshot them despite shields - tricky but effective
- The Revolver is particularly effective - can punch through shields and headshot them
- Point-blank shotgun blasts can destroy shields - extremely risky, only for last resort
- Flanking them from the sides or behind allows normal damage
- Their slow movement makes them easier to outmaneuver
- They often appear in small groups (2-4) as frontline protection
- They may be protecting more dangerous cultists behind them
- Once their shields are destroyed, they become regular Hatchet Cultists
- Their shields have limited HP - sustained fire will eventually destroy them
