- **Ritual items** - Symbols, fetishes, or artifacts related to their beliefs

## Abilities

### Fanatical Devotion

Cultist Martyrs fight to the death and will never surrender. They gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying.

### Suicide Charge

Cultist Martyrs charge into melee range with the intent to detonate. When moving into melee range and detonating in the same round, they gain +2 to SKILL for the purpose of reaching their target, but suffer -2 to SKILL for defending against attacks that round.

### Self-Detonation

Cultist Martyrs can detonate their explosive vest at any time. This is an automatic action that cannot be prevented once initiated. The explosion deals 6-10 damage (GM's choice or roll 1d5+5) to all targets within Short range, including the martyr. The martyr is automatically killed. The explosion can destroy cover, damage vehicles, and breach structures.

### Pain Immunity

Through fanaticism, drugs, or ritual preparation, Cultist Martyrs ignore pain and injury. They do not suffer penalties to SKILL when reduced to half STAMINA or less, and may push through injuries that would incapacitate normal humans.

### Ritual Preparation

At the start of combat, roll 1d6: on a 4-6, the martyr gains +1 to SKILL for the first three rounds of combat, representing ritual enhancement or chemical assistance.

## In Play

Cultist Martyrs serve as extreme suicide bomber threats, using themselves as weapons to eliminate opponents. They're the most dangerous cultists, appearing in very small numbers but representing a catastrophic threat. They will charge into combat and detonate without hesitation, making them particularly dangerous in close-quarters situations.
