# Afflicted

**Type:** Cult abomination / Minion  

## Overview

**Afflicted** are common genetic abominations created by the Greys and given to the Cult as fast assault biological weapons. These creatures are the result of Grey genetic experimentation, combining human DNA with alien biology and engineered for speed and aggression. Afflicted appear as gaunt, wiry humanoid figures with pale, almost greyish skin that seems to stretch taut over their frames. Their most disturbing feature is their arms - rather than hands, their forearms have been genetically modified into two large, organic spiked-mace clubs, the bone and muscle restructured into bludgeoning weapons. The transformation appears to be a living process, with the spiked clubs twitching and pulsing as if still growing. They live in never-ending pain from their genetic modifications, which drives their extreme aggression. Their biggest danger is their speed - Afflicted run as fast or faster than opponents, making avoiding them difficult in practice. Combine this with their fast, damaging attacks and it would be unwise to corner oneself when several Afflicted are coming your way.

## Characteristics

Afflicted are:

- **Genetic abominations** - Created by the Greys through genetic experimentation
- **Half-alien hybrids** - Combining human DNA with alien biology
- **Grey biological weapons** - Given to the Cult as fast assault units
- **Alien appearance** - Gaunt, wiry humanoids with pale greyish skin, genetically modified arms transformed into organic spiked-mace clubs
- **Fast** - Run as fast or faster than opponents (engineered for speed)
- **Aggressive** - Fast, damaging attacks (genetically programmed)
- **Pain-driven** - Living in never-ending pain from genetic modifications
- **Close-combat specialists** - Transformed arms into spiked-mace clubs (Grey-designed feature)
- **Group fighters** - Come in groups of several or above
- **Living transformation** - The spiked clubs appear to be a living, growing process

## Equipment

Afflicted typically carry:

- **Spiked-mace clubs** - Their forearms have been genetically modified into two large, organic spiked-mace clubs used for bludgeoning (Grey-engineered transformation)
- **No other weapons** - Their transformed arms are their only weapons
- **Living transformation** - The spiked clubs twitch and pulse as if still growing

## Abilities

### Incredible Speed

Afflicted run as fast or faster than opponents, making avoiding them difficult in practice. They gain +3 to SKILL for the purpose of movement and closing distance. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +2 to damage on the first attack, representing their speed and aggression.

### Fast, Damaging Attacks

Afflicted have fast, damaging attacks with their spiked-mace clubs. When attacking with their transformed arms, they gain +1 to damage and may make an additional attack every other round, representing their speed and aggression. Their attacks are fast and difficult to avoid - opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when defending against Afflicted attacks.

### Spiked-Mace Clubs

Afflicted's forearms have been genetically modified by the Greys into two large, organic spiked-mace clubs. The transformation appears to be a living process, with the bone and muscle restructured into bludgeoning weapons that twitch and pulse. These weapons deal 3-6 damage and can bludgeon opponents to death. The spiked clubs can penetrate light armor and cause bleeding. When an Afflicted hits with a spiked-mace club, roll 1d6: on a 5-6, the opponent suffers 1 point of additional damage per round from bleeding until treated.

### Group Tactics - Conga Line

Afflicted often group together in a conga line formation. When four or more Afflicted are present, they form a conga line, making them vulnerable to armor-penetrating weapons. The Lever-Action Rifle's armor penetration capabilities can pop heads off entire groups of them when they're in this formation. Opponents gain +1 to SKILL when attacking Afflicted in a conga line with armor-penetrating weapons.

### Never-Ending Pain

Afflicted are living in never-ending pain from their genetic modifications. The Grey-engineered transformation of their arms into spiked-mace clubs causes constant agony, which drives their extreme aggression and makes them relentless. They gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, representing their ability to push through pain. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Grey Genetic Creation

Afflicted are genetic abominations created by the Greys through advanced genetic experimentation. They are half-alien, half-human hybrids engineered specifically as fast assault biological weapons. The Greys have given these creatures to the Cult to aid their operations, creating a disturbing alliance between alien technology and dark cult practices. Afflicted are programmed (or genetically conditioned) to attack any non-Cult members on sight and cannot be reasoned with. Their speed and aggression are intentional design features, making them effective shock troops despite their simple tactics.

### Cornering Danger

It would be unwise to corner oneself when several Afflicted are coming your way. Their speed and fast, damaging attacks make them extremely dangerous in enclosed spaces. Opponents who are cornered suffer -2 to SKILL when defending against Afflicted attacks, as they cannot effectively dodge or retreat.

### Aggressive Charge

Afflicted charge into combat with incredible aggression. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +2 to damage on the first attack, but suffer -1 to SKILL for the purpose of defending against attacks that round. Their charge is intimidating - opponents must make a Willpower test or suffer -1 to SKILL for the first round of combat when facing multiple Afflicted.

## In Play

Afflicted serve as:

- **Fast melee threats** - Charging into close combat with incredible speed
- **Group combatants** - Attacking in coordinated groups
- **Genetic abominations** - Created by the Greys and given to the Cult
- **Pain-driven enemies** - Relentless due to never-ending pain
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their speed and aggression

### Game Considerations

- Afflicted are fast and aggressive - don't let them corner you
- Their speed makes avoiding them difficult - maintain distance when possible
- Close-range weapons (Shotgun, SASG, Incinerator) are excellent against them
- The STEN and Maxim Gun are also decent choices given their large ammo pool versus the number of Afflicted present
- Ironically, the best weapon against them is the Lever-Action Rifle
- Afflicted often group together in a conga line - this makes an entire group vulnerable to having their heads popped off by the armor penetration capabilities of the Lever-Action Rifle
- Their fast, damaging attacks make them dangerous in close combat
- Their spiked-mace clubs can cause bleeding - be prepared to treat wounds
- They come in groups of several or above - be prepared for swarms
- Their never-ending pain makes them relentless - they won't stop until eliminated
- They are under Grey genetic programming - cannot be reasoned with
- Their genetic modifications are a living process - the horror of Grey experimentation
- They may be protecting important cult sites, Grey genetic facilities, or areas where alien experiments are conducted
- Their presence indicates a connection between the Cult and the Greys - investigating their origin may reveal alien involvement
- Their alien appearance (gaunt form, pale greyish skin, transformed arms) makes them easily identifiable
- Don't corner yourself when several Afflicted are coming your way
