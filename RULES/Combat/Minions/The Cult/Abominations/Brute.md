# Brute

**Type:** Cult abomination

## Overview

**Brutes** are genetic abominations created by the Greys and given to the Cult as heavy assault biological weapons. These massive creatures are the result of Grey genetic experimentation, combining human DNA with alien biology and engineered for raw physical power. Brutes appear as hulking, eight-foot-tall humanoid figures with mottled grey-green skin that appears almost chitinous in places, suggesting both insectoid and reptilian alien DNA. Their limbs are massively overdeveloped, with arms that hang nearly to their knees and hands that have been modified into powerful, claw-like appendages capable of tearing through earth and flesh with equal ease. Their faces are disturbingly featureless - no eyes, nose, or mouth visible - just a smooth, expressionless surface that makes their aggressive behavior all the more unnerving. These abominations are seldom encountered but extremely aggressive and violent. Brutes, like their namesake, have very simple attack patterns, which are effectively bumrushing opponents to crush them or hurling slabs of earth they tear from the ground before throwing at them.

## Characteristics

Brutes are:

- **Minibosses** - Elite abominations that represent significant challenges
- **Genetic abominations** - Created by the Greys through genetic experimentation
- **Half-alien hybrids** - Combining human DNA with alien biology (insectoid/reptilian)
- **Grey biological weapons** - Given to the Cult as heavy assault units
- **Alien appearance** - Hulking eight-foot-tall humanoids with mottled grey-green chitinous skin, overdeveloped limbs, featureless faces
- **Extremely aggressive** - Violent and relentless (genetically programmed)
- **Dimwitted** - Very simple attack patterns (intentional design limitation)
- **Incredibly tough** - Can take enormous amounts of punishment
- **Strong** - Possess incredible strength (engineered by the Greys)
- **Seldom encountered** - Rare miniboss enemies

## Equipment

Brutes typically carry:

- **No weapons** - They use their massive strength and earth slabs
- **Torn earth slabs** - Slabs of earth they tear from the ground to hurl at opponents
- **Massive body** - Their alien-engineered form provides natural armor (chitinous skin, overdeveloped musculature)
- **Claw-like appendages** - Modified hands capable of tearing through earth and flesh

## Abilities

### Incredible Toughness

Brutes are incredibly tough minibosses. They gain +7 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for two additional rounds after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They can survive multiple TNT bundles, headshots from precision rifles, and other attacks that would instantly kill normal enemies (treat as normal damage instead).

### Massive Strength

Brutes possess incredible strength engineered by the Greys through genetic modification. Their overdeveloped limbs and alien-enhanced musculature grant them +3 to damage on all melee attacks and allow them to tear slabs of earth from the ground with ease. Their strength makes them extremely dangerous in close combat.

### Bumrush Attack

Brutes bumrush opponents to crush them. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +4 to damage on the first attack, representing their aggressive charge and crushing power. Opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when defending against bumrush attacks, as the Brute's massive size and speed make them difficult to avoid.

### Earth Slab Hurling

Brutes can tear slabs of earth from the ground and hurl them at opponents. This is a ranged attack with Short/Medium range. The earth slab deals 5-8 damage (area of effect) to all targets within Short range of the impact point. The Brute may use this ability once every other round. The earth slab can destroy cover and create difficult terrain.

### Simple Attack Patterns

Brutes have very simple attack patterns - they either bumrush to crush or hurl earth slabs. They can be easily kited due to their dimwitted nature and simple tactics. Opponents who maintain distance can avoid their attacks more easily.

### Dimwitted

Brutes are dimwitted with Very Low intelligence. They cannot use complex tactics and rely on their simple attack patterns. They can be easily outmaneuvered by intelligent opponents who understand their patterns.

### Aggressive Movements

Brutes have aggressive movements and a habit of closing in. They gain +2 to SKILL for the purpose of moving toward opponents, making it difficult to maintain distance. Their aggressive nature makes precision headshots situational, as they are constantly moving and closing in.

### Alien-Engineered Form

Brutes are genetic abominations created by the Greys, combining human DNA with alien biology. Their massive, alien-engineered form provides natural armor through chitinous skin patches and overdeveloped musculature. They gain +3 to STAMINA against all attacks, representing their thick alien hide and engineered resilience.

### Grey Genetic Creation

Brutes are genetic abominations created by the Greys through advanced genetic experimentation. They are half-alien, half-human hybrids engineered specifically as heavy assault biological weapons. The Greys have given these creatures to the Cult to aid their operations, creating a disturbing alliance between alien technology and dark cult practices. Brutes are programmed (or genetically conditioned) to attack any non-Cult members on sight and cannot be reasoned with. Their simple attack patterns are an intentional design limitation, making them predictable but extremely dangerous.

### Miniboss Status

Brutes are minibosses and should be treated as such. They have access to multiple combat options and represent a significant challenge. They will use their simple but effective attack patterns to overwhelm opponents.

## In Play

Brutes serve as:

- **Miniboss encounters** - Significant challenges that require careful tactics
- **Elite abominations** - Representing Grey genetic engineering and the Cult's alliance with aliens
- **Close-range threats** - Extremely dangerous with their crushing attacks
- **Ranged threats** - Can hurl earth slabs to attack at distance
- **High-priority targets** - Must be eliminated to progress

### Game Considerations

- Brutes are minibosses and should be fought with extreme caution
- They are incredibly tough - can take enormous amounts of punishment
- Fighting at close-quarters is ill-advised - their crushing attacks are devastating
- Long-range explosive weaponry (Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, TNT Bundles) are effective counters
- They can be hurt by powerful precision weapons (FG-42, Bolt Action Rifle) via headshot, but their aggressive movements and habit of closing-in makes this very situational
- They have very simple attack patterns and can be easily kited
- Maintain distance when possible - their earth slab attacks are dangerous but predictable
- Their bumrush attack is devastating - avoid getting caught in melee range
- They are dimwitted - use their simple patterns against them
- They often appear alone but represent a catastrophic threat
- They may be protecting important cult sites, Grey genetic facilities, or areas where alien experiments are conducted
- Their presence indicates a connection between the Cult and the Greys - investigating their origin may reveal alien involvement
- Their alien appearance (hulking form, chitinous skin, featureless face) makes them easily identifiable
- They are seldom encountered - rare but dangerous miniboss enemies
