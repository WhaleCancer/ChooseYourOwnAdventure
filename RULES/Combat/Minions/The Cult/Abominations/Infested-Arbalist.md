# Infested Arbalist

**Type:** Cult abomination / Minion  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Infested Arbalists** are uncommon abominations in Chapter Two - effectively the range version of the Infested Armor. Infested Arbalists run on the same principle as their sword-wielding brethren. They are a suit of armor animated by something and will attack opponents on sight.

Armed with a crossbow, the bolts they shoot are incendiary and being hit by a bolt causes the opponent's health and armor to drain over a period of time, like they are on fire. While their bolts are slow and easy to dodge, in enclosed linear spaces, they become a problem to deal with.

## Equipment

Infested Arbalists typically carry:

- **Crossbow** - Armed with a crossbow for ranged attacks
- **Incendiary bolts** - Bolts that are incendiary and cause fire-like effects
- **Animated armor** - Suit of armor that is animated by something (unknown force)

## Abilities

### Animated Armor

Infested Arbalists are a suit of armor animated by something. They will attack opponents on sight and cannot be reasoned with. The animation may be due to possession, dark magic, or some other supernatural force. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated.

### Crossbow Mastery

Infested Arbalists are masters of the crossbow. When using their crossbow, they gain +1 to SKILL for ranged attacks. The crossbow has Medium/Long range and deals 3-5 damage per bolt.

### Incendiary Bolts

The bolts Infested Arbalists shoot are incendiary. When an opponent is hit by a bolt, they suffer the initial damage (3-5) and then begin to burn. The incendiary effect causes:

- **Health drain** - The opponent suffers 1 point of STAMINA damage per round for 3-4 rounds
- **Armor drain** - The opponent's armor protection is reduced by 1 point per round for 3-4 rounds (representing the fire damaging the armor)
- **Fire-like effect** - Like they are on fire, the incendiary effect continues until extinguished or the duration expires

The incendiary effect can be extinguished by rolling on the ground, using water, or other fire-extinguishing methods (GM's discretion).

### Slow Projectiles

The bolts Infested Arbalists shoot are slow and easy to dodge. Opponents gain +2 to SKILL when attempting to dodge crossbow bolts, representing their slow speed and visibility. However, in enclosed linear spaces, this advantage is reduced, and opponents only gain +1 to SKILL when dodging.

### Linear Space Advantage

In enclosed linear spaces, Infested Arbalists become a problem to deal with. Their slow bolts are harder to dodge in tight spaces, and opponents have less room to maneuver. When fighting in enclosed linear spaces (corridors, narrow passages, etc.), opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when dodging crossbow bolts, and the Infested Arbalist gains +1 to SKILL for ranged attacks.

### Animated Resilience

As animated armor, Infested Arbalists gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before the animation fails and the armor collapses. They are immune to pain, fear, and most psychological effects.

### Armor Protection

Infested Arbalists' animated armor provides protection. They gain +2 to STAMINA against ranged attacks, and the armor may stop low-damage attacks entirely (GM's discretion). The armor is vulnerable to fire damage, which can damage the animation or the armor itself.

### Range Specialist

Infested Arbalists are range specialists, effectively the range version of Infested Armor. They prefer to fight at distance and will maintain range when possible. They gain +1 to SKILL when fighting at Medium or Long range.

## In Play

Infested Arbalists serve as:

- **Range threats** - Dangerous at medium to long range
- **Incendiary specialists** - Causing fire-like effects with their bolts
- **Linear space controllers** - Problematic in enclosed spaces
- **Animated abominations** - Suits of armor brought to life
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their incendiary attacks

### Game Considerations

- Infested Arbalists are range specialists - maintain distance when possible
- Precision weapons (Handgun, Revolver, Lever-Action Rifle, FG-42, Bolt Action Rifle) are good at dealing with them at a safe distance
- If you are in a position to flank them, closer-range weapons should also be decent against them
- Their bolts are slow and easy to dodge - use this to your advantage
- In enclosed linear spaces, they become a problem - avoid fighting them in tight spaces
- Their incendiary bolts cause health and armor to drain over time - be prepared to extinguish the fire
- Their animated armor provides protection - use high-damage or armor-penetrating weapons
- They often appear in small numbers (1-2) but represent a significant threat
- They may be protecting important cult sites or animation facilities
- Their animated armor makes them easily identifiable
- They are effectively the range version of Infested Armor - similar principles but different tactics
