## Abilities

### Disguise

Infested Armor disguise themselves as regular suits of armor until opponents walk too close to them. Opponents who first encounter Infested Armor must make a Perception or Awareness test to notice something is wrong before getting too close. If the test fails and opponents get within Short range, the Infested Armor unveils its disguise and immediately starts to attack, gaining +2 to SKILL for the first attack due to surprise.

### Animated Armor

Infested Armor are a suit of armor brought to 'life' by the dark magics of the Cult. They are controlled by something - it isn't clear what is controlling them, but they will attack opponents on sight once their disguise is unveiled. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Fast and Agile

Infested Armor are fast and agile despite being armor. They gain +2 to SKILL for the purpose of movement and closing distance. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +1 to damage on the first attack, representing their speed and aggression.

### Broadsword Mastery

Infested Armor are masters of the broadsword. The wide swings from their broadsword are not to be scoffed at. When attacking with the broadsword, they gain +2 to damage and the wide swings make them difficult to avoid. Opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when defending against broadsword attacks, as the wide swings cover a large area. The broadsword deals 4-7 damage per hit.

### Caltrop Throwing

If opponents are far enough away, Infested Armor will throw caltrops at them. This is a ranged attack with Short/Medium range. The caltrops create an area of effect (Short range) that:

- **Slows movement** - Opponents moving through the area suffer -2 to SKILL for movement
- **Causes damage** - Opponents stepping on caltrops suffer 1-2 damage
- **Creates hazards** - The caltrops remain on the ground until cleared
- **Area denial** - Makes it difficult to approach the Infested Armor

The Infested Armor may use this ability once every other round to control the battlefield and prevent opponents from closing in.

### Deceptively Dangerous

Infested Armor are deceptively dangerous. They appear as regular suits of armor but are fast, agile, and deadly. Opponents who underestimate them may be caught off guard. They gain +1 to SKILL for the first three rounds of combat after unveiling their disguise, representing their deceptive nature and surprise.

### Animated Resilience

As animated armor, Infested Armor gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before the animation fails and the armor collapses. They are immune to pain, fear, and most psychological effects.

### Armor Protection

Infested Armor's animated armor provides protection. They gain +3 to STAMINA against all attacks, and the armor may stop low-damage attacks entirely (GM's discretion). The armor is vulnerable to fire damage, which can damage the animation or the armor itself.

### Cramped Room Specialists

Infested Armor are located in cramped rooms, necessitating close-ranged weapons. In cramped spaces, their wide broadsword swings become even more dangerous, as opponents have less room to dodge. Opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when defending against broadsword attacks in cramped spaces.

### Knightly Duel

Dealing with Infested Armor is akin to - appropriately enough - a knightly duel, where opponents are required to dodge and strafe around their attacks for an opening. The Infested Armor will use its broadsword for wide swings and caltrops to control positioning, creating a tactical melee encounter.
