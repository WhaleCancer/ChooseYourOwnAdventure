# Possessed Doll

**Type:** Cult product / Minion (Elite, Possessed)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Possessed Dolls** are cult-manufactured products that the Cult creates and sells to unsuspecting buyers. These dolls appear to be innocent children's toys, but they contain evil spirits or dark magic that can activate and cause them to kill people. Not all Possessed Dolls activate - some remain dormant for years, making them unpredictable and dangerous. When they do activate, they become cunning, knife-wielding killers that use their small size and innocent appearance to their advantage.

The Cult manufactures these dolls through dark rituals, binding malevolent spirits or dark magic into the doll's form. They are then sold through various channels - toy stores, flea markets, online catalogs, or directly to unsuspecting buyers. The dolls appear completely normal until they activate, at which point they reveal their true nature as possessed killing machines.

## Abilities

### Small Size Advantage

Possessed Dolls are doll-sized, making them extremely difficult to hit. Opponents suffer -3 to SKILL when attacking them with ranged weapons and -2 to SKILL when attacking them with melee weapons, as their small size makes them hard to target. They can hide in small spaces, under furniture, in closets, or other concealed locations that normal-sized enemies cannot access.

### Stealth and Surprise Attacks

Possessed Dolls can hide easily and ambush victims. When hiding, opponents must make a Perception or Awareness test to notice them before they attack. If the test fails, the Doll gains +3 to SKILL for the first attack due to surprise. They can remain motionless, appearing as an innocent toy, until they strike.

### Knife Mastery

Possessed Dolls are skilled with their knives despite their small size. When attacking with a knife, they gain +2 to damage and may cause bleeding. When a Doll hits with a knife attack, roll 1d6: on a 4-6, the opponent suffers 1 point of additional damage per round from bleeding until treated. Their small size allows them to target vulnerable areas like the ankles, wrists, or throat.

### Possessed Resilience

Despite their small size and doll-like appearance, Possessed Dolls are harder to kill than normal dolls. They gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. The dark magic or spirit that animates them makes them more resilient than their physical form would suggest.

### Cult Manufacturing

Possessed Dolls are manufactured by the Cult through dark rituals. They can be sold to unsuspecting buyers through various channels - toy stores, flea markets, online catalogs, or directly. The dolls appear completely normal until they activate, making them dangerous wild cards. Not all dolls activate - some remain dormant for years, making them unpredictable.

### High Intelligence

Despite their small size and doll-like appearance, Possessed Dolls possess High intelligence. They can use cunning tactics, manipulate situations, and plan ambushes. They can understand human behavior and use it to their advantage, making them more dangerous than their appearance suggests.

### Innocent Appearance

Possessed Dolls appear as normal children's toys until they activate. This allows them to:
- Be sold to unsuspecting buyers
- Hide in plain sight
- Ambush victims who don't realize they're a threat
- Move through areas without raising suspicion (until they attack)

Opponents must make a Perception or Awareness test to realize a doll is possessed before it attacks, or they may dismiss it as harmless.

### Activation

Possessed Dolls may activate immediately after being sold, or they may remain dormant for days, weeks, or even years. When they do activate, they reveal their true nature and begin hunting. The GM determines when activation occurs - it may be triggered by:
- A specific event or condition
- The presence of a particular person
- A certain time or date
- Random chance
- Cult command (if the Cult wants to eliminate someone)

### Fire Vulnerability

Despite their possessed nature, Possessed Dolls are vulnerable to fire. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), they take double damage and the fire continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round until extinguished. Fire can destroy the doll's physical form and disrupt the dark magic binding the spirit.

### Small Size Vulnerability

While their small size makes them hard to hit, it also makes them vulnerable. They have low STAMINA (6) and can be easily destroyed if hit. Explosive weapons can eliminate them instantly, and area-of-effect attacks are particularly effective. However, their small size and stealth abilities make them difficult to target.

## In Play

Possessed Dolls serve as:

- **Elite stealth threats** - Cunning killers that use their small size to advantage
- **Cult products** - Manufactured and sold by the Cult
- **Unpredictable enemies** - Not all activate, making them dangerous wild cards
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their threat level
- **Psychological threats** - Their innocent appearance makes them unnerving

### Game Considerations

- Possessed Dolls are extremely dangerous despite their small size
- Their small size makes them hard to hit - use area-of-effect weapons or explosives
- Fire weapons (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators) are effective - they take double damage from fire
- Explosive weapons (grenade launcher, TNT bundles) can eliminate them instantly
- Shotguns are effective at close range due to spread
- Their stealth makes them dangerous - be alert for ambushes
- They often appear alone or in pairs but represent a significant threat
- They may be protecting important cult sites or ritual locations
- Their innocent appearance makes them difficult to identify as threats
- They should be fought at close range when possible, as their knife attacks are dangerous
- Their high intelligence makes them cunning opponents - don't underestimate them
- Not all dolls activate - some may remain dormant, creating uncertainty
- The Cult manufactures and sells these - investigating their origins may lead to the Cult
- Their small size allows them to hide in places normal enemies cannot - check small spaces
- They can ambush from hiding - maintain awareness of your surroundings
