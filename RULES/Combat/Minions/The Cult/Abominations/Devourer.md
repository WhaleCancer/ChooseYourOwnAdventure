# Devourer

**Type:** Cult abomination / Minion  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Devourers** are grotesque genetic abominations created by the Greys and given to the Cult as biological weapons. These half-alien, half-human hybrids are the result of Grey genetic experimentation, combining human DNA with alien biology to create terrifying killing machines. Devourers appear as tall, gaunt humanoid figures with unnaturally pale, almost translucent skin that reveals dark, pulsing alien organs beneath. Their limbs are elongated and jointed in ways that suggest both human and insectoid anatomy. Most disturbingly, they completely lack a head - their neck simply ends in a smooth, featureless stump. The moment they notice opponents, their entire torso splits open vertically from sternum to pelvis, revealing a massive maw lined with rows of razor-sharp fangs and a writhing, alien digestive tract - a feature engineered by the Greys for maximum terror and lethality.

They have two attacks. At a distance, they will vomit a stream of acidic stomach acid at medium-range - the acid itself contains alien biological components that burn with an unnatural greenish glow. When close enough, they will then charge directly at opponents before attempting to take a bite out of them with their torso-mouth.

## Abilities

### Alien Appearance

Devourers appear as tall, gaunt humanoid figures with unnaturally pale, almost translucent skin that reveals dark, pulsing alien organs beneath. Their elongated limbs and insectoid-like jointing make them immediately recognizable as non-human, but their humanoid shape can still catch opponents off guard. Opponents who first encounter a Devourer must make a Perception or Awareness test to recognize the full extent of their alien nature before the Devourer reveals its torso-mouth. If the test fails, the Devourer gains +2 to SKILL for the first attack due to surprise.

### Torso-Mouth

The moment Devourers notice opponents, their entire torso splits open, revealing rows of enlarged fangs. This is a horrifying sight that can cause fear. Opponents must make a Willpower test or suffer -1 to SKILL for the first round of combat when the Devourer's torso splits open. The torso-mouth is the Devourer's primary weapon for close-range attacks.

### Acidic Vomit Attack

At a distance, Devourers will vomit a stream of acidic stomach acid at medium-range. The acid contains alien biological components that burn with an unnatural greenish glow, making it easily identifiable. This is a ranged attack with Medium range that deals 3-6 damage. The alien acid continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round for 2-3 rounds unless treated. The acid can destroy light cover and cause environmental hazards. The Devourer may use this ability once per round.

### Charge and Bite

When close enough, Devourers will charge directly at opponents before attempting to take a bite out of them. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +3 to damage on the bite attack, representing their aggressive charge. The bite deals 4-7 damage and can cause severe wounds. Opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when defending against charge and bite attacks.

### Enlarged Fangs

Devourers' rows of enlarged fangs are their primary melee weapon. When biting, they gain +1 to damage and may cause bleeding. When a Devourer hits with a bite attack, roll 1d6: on a 5-6, the opponent suffers 1 point of additional damage per round from bleeding until treated.

### Laughably Weak Against Fire

Despite their imposing appearance, Devourers are laughably weak against fire. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), they take triple damage and are automatically eliminated if the fire damage would reduce them to 0 STAMINA or below. Fire weapons can one-shot them without any difficulty. This extreme vulnerability makes fire the most effective weapon against them.

### Moderate Toughness

While Devourers are weak against fire, they have moderate toughness otherwise. They gain +2 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They can survive attacks that would kill normal enemies, but their fire vulnerability makes them easier to eliminate than their toughness would suggest.

### Headless

Devourers lack a head entirely. This makes them immune to headshots and decapitation. However, their torso-mouth serves as their primary attack method, making them dangerous despite lacking a head.

### Grey Genetic Creation

Devourers are genetic abominations created by the Greys through advanced genetic experimentation. They are half-alien, half-human hybrids engineered specifically as biological weapons. The Greys have given these creatures to the Cult to aid their operations, creating a disturbing alliance between alien technology and dark cult practices. Devourers are programmed (or genetically conditioned) to attack any non-Cult members on sight and cannot be reasoned with. They may be under Grey mind control, genetic programming, or some other form of alien control mechanism.

### Alien Biological Components

The acidic vomit and biological systems of Devourers may contain alien components engineered by the Greys. The acid may have unusual properties beyond normal stomach acid, potentially causing additional effects (GM's discretion). Their genetic structure combines human and alien DNA in ways that create their unique abilities and vulnerabilities.

## In Play

Devourers serve as:

- **Grotesque threats** - Horrifying abominations that reveal their true nature
- **Dual-range threats** - Dangerous at both medium and close range
- **Fire-vulnerable enemies** - Extremely weak against fire weapons
- **Genetic abominations** - Created by the Greys and given to the Cult
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their threat level

### Game Considerations

- Devourers are laughably weak against fire - Molotov Cocktails, Flare Guns, and Incinerators can one-shot them without any difficulty
- If you lack fire weapons, then explosives (Grenade Launchers, TNT Bundles) are good alternatives
- Shotguns and SASG are also good alternatives when dealing with these monsters
- Their alien appearance can catch opponents off guard - be alert for their non-human nature and torso-mouth
- Their torso-mouth is horrifying - be prepared for fear effects
- Their acidic vomit is dangerous at medium range - maintain distance or close in quickly
- Their charge and bite is devastating at close range - avoid getting caught in melee
- They lack a head, making them immune to headshots
- They often appear in small numbers (1-3) but represent a significant threat
- They may be protecting important cult sites, Grey genetic facilities, or areas where alien experiments are conducted
- Their presence indicates a connection between the Cult and the Greys - investigating their origin may reveal alien involvement
- Their alien appearance (translucent skin, elongated limbs, headless form) makes them easily identifiable even before their torso splits open
- Fire is by far the most effective weapon against them - use it if available
