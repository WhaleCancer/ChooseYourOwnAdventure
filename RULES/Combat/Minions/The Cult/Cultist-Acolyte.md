## Overview

## Abilities

### Fanatical Devotion

Cultist Acolytes fight to the death and will not surrender. They gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, representing their willingness to push beyond normal limits.

### Ritual Preparation

Cultist Acolytes may have been prepared for combat through rituals or drugs. At the start of combat, roll 1d6: on a 5-6, the acolyte gains +1 to SKILL for the first three rounds of combat, representing ritual enhancement or chemical assistance.

### Unsettling Presence

Cultist Acolytes' fanaticism and strange behavior can be unnerving. Opponents must make a Willpower or LUCK test (GM's choice) or suffer -1 to SKILL for the first round of combat when facing cultists for the first time.

### Strength in Numbers

When four or more Cultist Acolytes are present, each gains +1 to damage rolls, representing their ability to coordinate attacks and overwhelm opponents through sheer fanaticism.

## In Play

Cultist Acolytes serve as:

- **Ideological antagonists** - Opposing investigations that threaten their beliefs or operations

- **Mystery elements** - May have knowledge of paranormal phenomena or strange events
- **Ritual threats** - May be performing dangerous rituals or ceremonies
- **Conspiracy elements** - Often connected to larger supernatural or alien conspiracies

### Game Considerations

- They may have access to knowledge or abilities beyond normal criminals
- Their connection to cult leaders or supernatural forces adds mystery
- The willingness to fight to the death makes them particularly dangerous
- They may be under mind control or supernatural influence, creating moral dilemmas
