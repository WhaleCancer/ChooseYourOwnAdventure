# Peacekeeper

**Type:** Cult member / Minion (Elite, Undead)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Peacekeepers** are elite enemies that are essentially "supped-up" Corrupted Officers in riot gear. They are Chapter Two's version of the Adept, representing the pinnacle of corrupted law enforcement. Best identified by their riot gear, Peacekeepers are one of the toughest enemies you fight in the game short of bosses or minibosses. Their bullet-proof armor makes them incredibly resilient to damage, often taking several TNT bundles to the face, and their weapons make them formidable opponents. They attempt to flush opponents out of cover with red tear gas before blasting them with their SASG (semi-automatic shotgun).

- **Red tear gas** - [[../../Weapons/Less-Lethal/Tear-Gas|Tear gas canisters]] (red variant) to flush opponents out of cover

## Abilities

### Incredible Resilience

Peacekeepers are incredibly resilient, often taking several TNT bundles to the face. They gain +6 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may continue fighting for two additional rounds after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They can survive multiple TNT bundles, headshots from lever-action rifles, and other attacks that would instantly kill normal enemies (treat as normal damage instead).

### Bullet-Proof Armor

Peacekeepers wear bullet-proof armor that provides exceptional protection. They gain +4 to STAMINA against ranged attacks, and the armor may stop low-damage attacks entirely (GM's discretion). The armor is vulnerable to fire damage, which bypasses some of the protection.

### Riot Gear Protection

Peacekeepers wear full riot gear that provides additional protection. They gain +2 to STAMINA against melee attacks and thrown objects. The riot helmet protects their head, making headshots more difficult (-1 to SKILL for opponents attempting headshots).

### Tear Gas Flush

Peacekeepers use red tear gas to flush opponents out of cover. They can throw tear gas canisters at opponents hiding behind cover. The tear gas creates an area of effect (Short range) that:

- **Forces opponents out of cover** - Opponents must leave cover or suffer penalties
- **Causes vision impairment** - Opponents suffer -2 to SKILL for ranged attacks while in the gas cloud
- **Causes breathing difficulties** - Opponents must make a PHYSICAL test or suffer -1 to STAMINA per round while in the gas
- **Lingers** - The gas cloud persists for 2-3 rounds

The Peacekeeper may use this ability once every other round to flush opponents out of cover before closing in with the SASG.

### SASG Mastery

Peacekeepers are masters of the SASG (semi-automatic shotgun). When attacking with the SASG, they gain +2 to damage at Short range. The SASG's high rate of fire makes it devastating in close combat. Opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when defending against SASG attacks at Short range due to the weapon's spread and power.

### Tactical Fire Control

Peacekeepers retain the tactical fire control of Corrupted Officers. They can hold their fire when opponents hide out of their line of sight, resume firing when opponents are revealed, and seek alternate angles if opponents remain hidden. This makes them more dangerous than typical cultists.

### Crouching Fire

Peacekeepers can crouch while firing, an ability only they and Adepts can use. When crouching, opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when attacking them at Medium or Long range, but the Peacekeeper suffers no penalty to SKILL when firing while crouched.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures reanimated through dark magic, Peacekeepers gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Police Training

Peacekeepers retain their law enforcement training. They gain +1 to SKILL for tactical positioning and may use cover effectively. They understand police tactics and can anticipate opponent movements.

### Fire Vulnerability

While their armor protects against bullets, it is vulnerable to fire. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), the Peacekeeper takes full damage and the fire continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round until extinguished. The fire also weakens the armor's protection, reducing the +4 STAMINA bonus to +2 for the next round.

## In Play

Peacekeepers serve as:

- **Elite combatants** - Among the toughest enemies short of bosses/minibosses
- **Tactical threats** - Using tear gas to flush opponents out of cover
- **Close-range specialists** - Devastating with SASG shotguns
- **Resilient opponents** - Can take enormous amounts of punishment
- **High-priority targets** - Should be eliminated quickly due to their threat level

### Game Considerations

- Peacekeepers are extremely dangerous and should be fought with extreme caution
- Their incredible resilience means they can take several TNT bundles to the face
- Fighting at close range is risky due to their SASG - maintain distance when possible
- The safest option is maintaining distance and using explosive weapons or high-precision weapons
- Precision weapons (revolver, lever-action rifle, FG-42, bolt-action rifle) are effective
- Headshots are preferable but won't instantly kill them due to their riot helmet
- Taking cover or constant strafing is a must to avoid their shotgun blasts
- Incendiary weapons (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators) are effective in bypassing their armor
- Their tear gas can flush opponents out of cover - be prepared to move
- They often appear in small numbers (1-3) but represent a catastrophic threat
- They may be protecting important cult leaders or police-controlled locations
- Their riot gear makes them easily identifiable
- They drop shotgun shells upon death
- They represent the pinnacle of corrupted law enforcement
