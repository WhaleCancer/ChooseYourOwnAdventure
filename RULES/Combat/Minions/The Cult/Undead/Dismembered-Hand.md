# Dismembered Hand

**Type:** Cult minion / Undead (Basic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Dismembered Hands** are the smallest enemies in the game - dismembered rotting hands that came to life thanks to the dark magic of the Cult. They are found infesting every nook and cranny, ambushing opponents when they least expect (like inside ammo crates). Although they will be one-shotted by anything, their incredibly small hitbox, nimble speed, and suffocation attacks on opponents make them an annoying enemy to fight against, forcing opponents to be alert for their surroundings.

Like most of the content of the "I'll Be Home for Cultmas" bonus map, the Dismembered Hand is directly based on the Hands from the 1997 game Blood. And, like in Blood, the hands behave like Ash's dismembered hand from Evil Dead 2.

## Abilities

### Incredibly Small Hitbox

Dismembered Hands are the smallest enemies in the game. Their incredibly small hitbox makes them difficult to hit. Opponents suffer -2 to SKILL when attacking Dismembered Hands with ranged weapons, and -1 to SKILL when attacking with melee weapons, representing the difficulty of hitting such a small target.

### Nimble Speed

Dismembered Hands are incredibly nimble and fast despite being just a hand. They can move quickly and are difficult to track. They gain +2 to SKILL for the purpose of moving and dodging attacks, making them hard to hit even when spotted.

### Suffocation Attack

Dismembered Hands can grab opponents and attempt to suffocate them. When a Dismembered Hand successfully hits with a melee attack, roll 1d6: on a 4-6, the hand grabs the opponent (typically around the neck or face). While grabbed:

- **Suffocation** - The opponent suffers 1 point of STAMINA damage per round
- **Vision impairment** - The opponent suffers -2 to SKILL for all actions
- **Immobilization** - The opponent cannot take most actions while struggling
- **Shake off** - The opponent must make a SKILL or PHYSICAL test (GM's choice) to break free
- **Frantically remove** - The opponent must frantically remove the hand, requiring a successful test each round

This suffocation attack makes them annoying to fight against, forcing opponents to be alert for their surroundings.

### Ambush Specialist

Dismembered Hands are found infesting every nook and cranny, ambushing opponents when they least expect. They can hide in:

- **Ammo crates** - Inside containers and crates
- **Hidden spaces** - Nooks, crannies, and tight spaces
- **Unexpected locations** - Anywhere they can fit

When encountered, roll 1d6: on a 1-4, the Dismembered Hand(s) ambush from an unexpected location (ammo crate, container, hidden space), appearing within Short range of opponents and gaining +2 to SKILL for the first attack due to surprise.

### One-Shottable

Dismembered Hands will be one-shotted by almost anything. They have STAMINA: 2, making them extremely vulnerable. Almost any attack will eliminate them, but their small hitbox and nimble speed make them difficult to hit.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures, Dismembered Hands gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. However, with only 2 STAMINA, this rarely matters - they are almost always eliminated in a single hit.

### Very Low Intelligence

Dismembered Hands are mindless undead. They have Very Low intelligence and cannot use tactics beyond basic ambush and grab. They simply attack the nearest living target.

### Infesting Presence

Dismembered Hands are found infesting every nook and cranny. They can appear in large numbers throughout an area, making them a persistent nuisance. Their ability to hide in unexpected places makes them particularly annoying.

## In Play

Dismembered Hands serve as:

- **Annoyance enemies** - More of a nuisance than a serious threat individually
- **Ambush threats** - Hiding in unexpected places and ambushing opponents
- **Suffocation specialists** - Can grab and suffocate opponents
- **Environmental hazards** - Found infesting areas and forcing alertness

### Game Considerations

- Dismembered Hands are the smallest enemies in the game - difficult to hit due to small hitbox
- They will be one-shotted by almost anything, but their nimble speed and small size make them hard to hit
- Close-ranged weapons like the Shotgun are the most cost-effective ways to deal with them
- Great firepower like the Thompson SMG works well due to high rate of fire
- Individually, a Pitchfork or other melee weapon should be more than enough
- Their suffocation attack can be annoying - be prepared to break free
- They ambush from unexpected places (ammo crates, containers, hidden spaces) - be alert
- They force opponents to be alert for their surroundings
- They often appear in small groups (1-4) but can infest entire areas
- They are more of a nuisance than a serious threat, but can be dangerous if they grab and suffocate
- Their incredibly small hitbox makes ranged attacks difficult (-2 to SKILL)
- Their nimble speed makes them hard to track and hit
- They are based on the Hands from Blood (1997) and Ash's dismembered hand from Evil Dead 2
