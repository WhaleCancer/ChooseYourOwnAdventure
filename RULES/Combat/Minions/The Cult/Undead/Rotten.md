# Rotten

**Type:** Cult minion / Undead (Basic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Rottens** are Chapter Two's version of Corpses and, somehow, even more grotesque in appearance. These decomposing zombies only appear in swamps and wetlands and emerge from the ground when opponents are nearby. Like Corpses, Rottens are decomposing zombies that rely on overwhelming numbers to be a threat. Unlike Corpses, Rottens are even slower and more sluggish than the deceptively agile Corpses, but this disadvantage is traded off with their special - and annoying - ability to grab opponents and slowly drain their health while they are held, requiring opponents to frantically shake them off to free themselves. This can become dangerous as Rottens come in groups of over a dozen.

## Statistics

**SKILL:** 4  
**STAMINA:** 6  
**HABITAT:** Swamps, wetlands, marshy areas, areas where black magic has been performed near water  
**NUMBER ENCOUNTERED:** 8-15 (1d8+7)  
**TYPE:** Undead  
**REACTION:** Hostile  
**INTELLIGENCE:** Very Low

## Characteristics

Rottens are:

- **Swamp zombies** - Chapter Two's version of Corpses, even more grotesque
- **Slower and more sluggish** - Even slower than Corpses
- **Overwhelming numbers** - Rely on swarming tactics in large groups
- **Grabbers** - Can grab and drain health from opponents
- **Emerging** - Rise from the ground in swamps and wetlands
- **Basic enemies** - More of a hassle than a serious threat individually

## Equipment

Rottens typically carry:

- **No weapons** - They attack with their bare hands and teeth
- **Tattered, waterlogged clothing** - Remnants of whatever they were buried in, now soaked and rotting
- **Rotting, waterlogged flesh** - Their undead bodies are in various states of decay, made worse by swamp conditions

## Abilities

### Overwhelming Numbers

Rottens rely on overwhelming numbers to threaten opponents. When eight or more Rottens are present, each gains +1 to damage rolls, representing their ability to swarm and overwhelm opponents. They attack in very large groups (over a dozen), making them dangerous despite their individual weakness and slowness.

### Slower and More Sluggish

Unlike Corpses, Rottens are even slower and more sluggish. They have lower SKILL (4) than Corpses (5), making them easier to hit and less accurate. However, their slowness gives opponents crucial time to reload weapons like shotguns and SASGs, something that was not present when facing the faster Corpses.

### Grab and Drain

Rottens have a special - and annoying - ability to grab opponents and slowly drain their health while they are held. When a Rotten successfully hits with a melee attack, roll 1d6: on a 4-6, the Rotten grabs the opponent. While grabbed:

- **Health drain** - The opponent suffers 1 point of STAMINA damage per round
- **Immobilization** - The opponent cannot move or take most actions
- **Shake off** - The opponent must make a SKILL or PHYSICAL test (GM's choice) to break free
- **Frantically shake** - The opponent must frantically shake the Rotten off, requiring a successful test each round

This can become dangerous as Rottens come in groups of over a dozen, and multiple Rottens can grab the same opponent, making it harder to break free.

### Emerging from Swamp Ground

Rottens only appear in swamps and wetlands and emerge from the ground when opponents are nearby. When encountered, roll 1d6: on a 1-4, the Rottens emerge from the swampy ground at the start of combat, appearing within Short range of opponents. This can catch opponents off guard, as the Rottens appear suddenly from below the swampy terrain.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures, Rottens gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Very Low Intelligence

Rottens are dumb and weak. They have Very Low intelligence and cannot use tactics beyond basic swarming. They cannot use weapons, tools, or complex strategies. They simply attack the nearest living target.

### Weak Individual Threat

Individually, Rottens are weak and pose little threat. They have low SKILL (4) and low STAMINA (6), making them easy to eliminate one-on-one. However, their overwhelming numbers and grab ability make them dangerous in groups.

### Fire Vulnerability

Rottens are vulnerable to fire damage. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), they take double damage and the fire continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round until extinguished. Fire is extremely effective against them.

### Explosive Vulnerability

Rottens are vulnerable to explosive damage. When hit by explosives (grenades, TNT bundles, etc.), they take full area-of-effect damage. Explosives can eliminate entire groups of Rottens at once.

### Swamp Dwellers

Rottens only appear in swamps and wetlands. They are adapted to these environments and may gain advantages in swampy terrain, such as being able to move through waterlogged ground without penalty.

## In Play

Rottens serve as:

- **Swarm enemies** - Overwhelming opponents through numbers
- **Hassle encounters** - More annoying than individually threatening
- **Swamp encounters** - Found only in swamps and wetlands
- **Undead threats** - Reanimated through black magic
- **Grab specialists** - Can immobilize and drain health from opponents

### Game Considerations

- Rottens are basic enemies - individually weak but dangerous in very large groups
- Their low health makes them vulnerable to rapid-fire weapons
- Explosive weapons (grenade launcher, TNT bundles) can delete entire hordes
- Fire weapons (incinerator, Molotov cocktails) are extremely effective - they melt Rottens
- Rapid-fire weapons (STEN, Maxim gun) are excellent for dealing with swarms
- Shotguns (double-barreled, semi-automatic) and SASGs are more useful against Rottens than Corpses because:
  - Rottens are slower, giving crucial time to reload
  - This advantage was not present when facing the faster Corpses
- Their grab ability can immobilize and drain health - be prepared to break free
- Multiple Rottens can grab the same opponent, making it harder to break free
- They often emerge from swampy ground - watch for ambushes in wetlands
- They attack in very large groups (8-15, over a dozen) - be prepared for swarms
- They are slower than Corpses, making them easier to hit but still dangerous in numbers
- Their swampy, waterlogged appearance makes them even more grotesque than Corpses
- They are more of a hassle than a serious threat individually, but their grab ability and numbers make them dangerous
