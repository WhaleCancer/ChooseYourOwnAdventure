- **Persistent** - Latch onto targets and cause continuous damage
- **Nuisance enemies** - Individually weak but dangerous if not removed
- **Undead** - Reanimated through black magic

## Abilities

### Strangulation Attack

Choking Hands leap onto victims and attempt to strangle them. When a Choking Hand successfully attaches to a target (requires a melee attack that hits), it begins strangling. The target suffers 2-3 damage per round and cannot speak or use abilities that require breathing. The target must make a PHYSICAL test each round to remove the Choking Hand, or continue suffering damage.

### Small and Stealthy

Choking Hands are small and stealthy, making them hard to detect. Opponents must make a Perception or Awareness test to notice Choking Hands before they attack. If the test fails, the Choking Hand gains +2 to SKILL for the first attack due to surprise. They can hide in dark corners, under objects, or in other concealed locations.

### Persistent Attachment

Once a Choking Hand attaches to a target, it is persistent and difficult to remove. The target must make a PHYSICAL test each round to remove it. If the test fails, the Choking Hand continues strangling, dealing 2-3 damage per round. Multiple Choking Hands can attach to the same target, increasing the damage.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures, Choking Hands gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Very Low Intelligence

Choking Hands have Very Low intelligence and cannot use complex tactics. They simply seek out victims to strangle and attack the nearest living target. They cannot be reasoned with or intimidated.

### Fire Vulnerability

Choking Hands are vulnerable to fire damage. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), they take double damage and are automatically eliminated if the fire damage would reduce them to 0 STAMINA or below. Fire is extremely effective against them.

### Explosive Vulnerability

Choking Hands are vulnerable to explosive damage. When hit by explosives (grenades, TNT bundles, etc.), they take full area-of-effect damage. Explosives can eliminate multiple Choking Hands at once.

### Low Individual Threat

Individually, Choking Hands are weak and pose little threat. They have low SKILL (5) and very low STAMINA (3), making them easy to eliminate one-on-one. However, their ability to attach and cause continuous damage makes them dangerous if not removed quickly.

## In Play

Choking Hands serve as:

- **Nuisance enemies** - Harassing and strangling opponents
- **Stealth threats** - Ambushing unsuspecting targets
- **Swarm enemies** - Dangerous in numbers due to persistent attachment
- **Undead threats** - Reanimated through black magic
- **Low-priority targets** - Individually weak but dangerous if not removed

### Game Considerations

- Choking Hands are small and stealthy - difficult to detect before they attack
- Fire weapons (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators) are extremely effective - they can eliminate multiple Choking Hands at once
- Explosive weapons (grenade launcher, TNT bundles) can delete entire groups
- Rapid-fire weapons (STEN, handguns) are good for dealing with swarms
- Shotguns are effective at close range due to spread
- Their strangulation attack is dangerous - remove them quickly if attached
- Multiple Choking Hands can attach to the same target - increasing the threat
- They often appear in small groups (2-8) - be prepared for ambushes
- They may be protecting important cult sites or ritual locations
- Their small size makes them difficult to eliminate quickly
- They are nuisance enemies - individually weak but dangerous if not removed
- Their stealth makes them effective at ambushing unsuspecting targets
- They can latch onto targets and cause continuous damage - remove them immediately if attached
