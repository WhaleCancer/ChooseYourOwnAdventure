# Corpse

**Type:** Cult minion / Undead (Basic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Corpses** are straight-up zombies, reanimated dead brought back to life via black magic. They are often encountered in the wild and are more of a hassle to deal with than a threat. Given that they are zombies, they are dumb and weak, relying on overwhelming numbers to threaten opponents. However, unlike conventional zombies, they are deceptively fast, capable of pouncing opponents at close-range. They often emerge from the ground in large groups of up to a dozen.

## Statistics

**SKILL:** 5  
**STAMINA:** 6  
**HABITAT:** Wild areas, graveyards, abandoned locations, areas where black magic has been performed  
**NUMBER ENCOUNTERED:** 6-12 (1d6+5)  
**TYPE:** Undead  
**REACTION:** Hostile  
**INTELLIGENCE:** Very Low

## Characteristics

Corpses are:

- **Zombies** - Reanimated dead brought back via black magic
- **Dumb and weak** - Low intelligence and individual threat
- **Overwhelming numbers** - Rely on swarming tactics
- **Deceptively fast** - Can pounce at close range despite being zombies
- **Emerging** - Often rise from the ground in large groups
- **Basic enemies** - More of a hassle than a serious threat individually

## Equipment

Corpses typically carry:

- **No weapons** - They attack with their bare hands and teeth
- **Tattered clothing** - Remnants of whatever they were buried in
- **Rotting flesh** - Their undead bodies are in various states of decay

## Abilities

### Overwhelming Numbers

Corpses rely on overwhelming numbers to threaten opponents. When six or more Corpses are present, each gains +1 to damage rolls, representing their ability to swarm and overwhelm opponents. They attack in large groups, making them dangerous despite their individual weakness.

### Deceptive Speed

Unlike conventional zombies, Corpses are deceptively fast. They can move quickly and pounce at close range. When moving into melee range and attacking in the same round, they gain +2 to SKILL for the pounce attack, representing their surprising speed. This makes them more dangerous than typical slow zombies.

### Pounce Attack

Corpses can pounce opponents at close range. When within Short range, they may make a pounce attack that deals 2-4 damage. The pounce is fast and difficult to avoid - opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when defending against pounce attacks.

### Emerging from Ground

Corpses often emerge from the ground in large groups. When encountered, roll 1d6: on a 1-3, the Corpses emerge from the ground at the start of combat, appearing within Short range of opponents. This can catch opponents off guard, as the Corpses appear suddenly from below.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures, Corpses gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Low Intelligence

Corpses are dumb and weak. They have Very Low intelligence and cannot use tactics beyond basic swarming. They cannot use weapons, tools, or complex strategies. They simply attack the nearest living target.

### Weak Individual Threat

Individually, Corpses are weak and pose little threat. They have low SKILL (5) and low STAMINA (6), making them easy to eliminate one-on-one. However, their overwhelming numbers make them dangerous in groups.

### Fire Vulnerability

Corpses are vulnerable to fire damage. When hit by fire damage (Molotov cocktails, flare guns, incinerators, etc.), they take double damage and the fire continues to burn, dealing 1 point of damage per round until extinguished. Fire is extremely effective against them.

### Explosive Vulnerability

Corpses are vulnerable to explosive damage. When hit by explosives (grenades, TNT bundles, etc.), they take full area-of-effect damage. Explosives can eliminate entire groups of Corpses at once.

## In Play

Corpses serve as:

- **Swarm enemies** - Overwhelming opponents through numbers
- **Hassle encounters** - More annoying than individually threatening
- **Wild encounters** - Often found in remote or abandoned areas
- **Undead threats** - Reanimated through black magic
- **Cannon fodder** - Weak individually but dangerous in groups

### Game Considerations

- Corpses are basic enemies - individually weak but dangerous in large groups
- Their low health makes them vulnerable to rapid-fire weapons
- Explosive weapons (grenade launcher, TNT bundles) can delete entire hordes
- Fire weapons (incinerator, Molotov cocktails) are extremely effective - they melt Corpses
- Rapid-fire weapons (STEN, Maxim gun) are excellent for dealing with swarms
- Shotguns (double-barreled, semi-automatic) are poor weapons against them due to:
  - Low rate of fire
  - Small ammo pool
  - Slow reload time
  - Being a hindrance against overwhelming numbers
- Their deceptive speed makes them more dangerous than typical slow zombies
- They can pounce at close range - be prepared for sudden attacks
- They often emerge from the ground - watch for ambushes
- They attack in large groups (6-12) - be prepared for swarms
- They are dumb and weak individually - focus fire can eliminate them quickly
- Their overwhelming numbers make them dangerous despite individual weakness
- They are more of a hassle than a serious threat, but can be dangerous if not handled properly
- Their swampier and uncommon counterpart are the Rotten (a variant found in swampy areas)
