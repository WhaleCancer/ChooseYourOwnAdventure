# Skeleton (Hatchet)

**Type:** Cult minion / Undead (Basic)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Hatchet Skeletons** are the reanimated remains of Cultists imbued with the Will whilst alive. Introduced in C1M5: the Crypt, these skeletons are the undead version of Hatchet Cultists. Compared to Corpses, they still retain their sentience and are, therefore, much more dangerous and smarter than the former. As they are still sentient, they can use weapons just fine and are very similar to Hatchet Cultists but possess less HP.

## Statistics

**SKILL:** 7  
**STAMINA:** 6  
**HABITAT:** Crypts, graveyards, abandoned locations, areas where black magic has been performed  
**NUMBER ENCOUNTERED:** 3-8 (1d6+2)  
**TYPE:** Undead  
**REACTION:** Hostile  
**INTELLIGENCE:** Average-Low

## Characteristics

Hatchet Skeletons are:

- **Sentient undead** - Retain their sentience unlike Corpses
- **Weapon users** - Can use weapons just fine
- **Smarter** - Much more dangerous and smarter than Corpses
- **Reanimated Cultists** - Were Cultists imbued with the Will whilst alive
- **Less HP** - Possess less health than their living counterparts
- **Overwhelming numbers** - Rely on numbers and firepower

## Equipment

Hatchet Skeletons typically carry:

- **Hatchets** - Ritual axes, hatchets, or other bladed melee weapons
- **Backup weapons** - Ritual knives or improvised weapons
- **Ritual items** - Symbols, fetishes, or artifacts related to their beliefs
- **Bone structure** - Their skeletal bodies provide some natural protection

## Abilities

### Sentient Undead

Unlike Corpses, Hatchet Skeletons retain their sentience. They can use weapons, understand tactics, and coordinate with other skeletons. They are much more dangerous and smarter than mindless zombies.

### Melee Specialist

Hatchet Skeletons excel at close combat. When making melee attacks, they gain +1 to damage with axes or bladed weapons, just like their living counterparts.

### Overwhelming Numbers

Hatchet Skeletons rely on overwhelming numbers and firepower to overwhelm opponents. When four or more Hatchet Skeletons are present, each gains +1 to damage rolls, representing their ability to coordinate attacks and swarm opponents.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures, Hatchet Skeletons gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Less HP

Hatchet Skeletons possess less HP than their living counterparts. They have STAMINA: 6 compared to Hatchet Cultists' STAMINA: 9, making them more vulnerable to damage.

### Fanatical Devotion

Hatchet Skeletons fight to the death and will not surrender. They retain the fanaticism they had in life, even in undeath.

### Bone Structure

Their skeletal bodies provide some natural protection. They gain +1 to STAMINA against melee attacks, representing their bony structure deflecting some blows.

## In Play

Hatchet Skeletons serve as:

- **Melee threats** - Charging into close combat with hatchets
- **Sentient undead** - More dangerous than mindless zombies
- **Group combatants** - Attacking in coordinated groups
- **Undead Cultists** - Retaining their cultist abilities in undeath

### Game Considerations

- Hatchet Skeletons are more dangerous than Corpses due to their sentience and weapon use
- Deal with them like you would their more fleshy and living brethren
- They are even more vulnerable than living cultists (less HP)
- They rely on sheer numbers and firepower to overwhelm opponents
- Close-range to fast-firing weapons (STEN, Shotgun, SASG, Maxim Gun, Incinerator) work well
- If in large groups, explosives or splash damage weapons (TNT Bundle, Molotov Cocktail, Grenade Launcher) should suffice
- They can use weapons and tactics, making them smarter than Corpses
- Their lower HP makes them easier to eliminate than living cultists
- They often appear in groups (3-8) - be prepared for swarms
- They retain their fanaticism even in undeath
