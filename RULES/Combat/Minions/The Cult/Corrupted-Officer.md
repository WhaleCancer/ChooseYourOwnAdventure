# Corrupted Officer

**Type:** Cult member / Minion (Undead)  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Corrupted Officers** are police officers who have been indoctrinated into the Cult by the Chief of Police and are considered a form of undead, having been murdered beforehand - probably an effect of imbuement. These cops wear police uniforms with unbuttoned shirts, revealing the mark of the Cult sliced upon their chests. They wield Magnum Revolvers and are the only enemies capable of holding their fire when opponents hide out of their line of sight, unlike other enemies who shoot regardless of cover blocking their shots. They are tactical, precise shooters who attack in groups and represent a sufficient threat.

## Abilities

### Tactical Fire Control

Corrupted Officers are the only enemies capable of holding their fire when opponents hide out of their line of sight. Unlike other enemies who shoot regardless of cover blocking their shots, Corrupted Officers will:

- **Hold fire** when opponents are behind cover and out of line of sight
- **Resume firing** immediately when opponents are revealed again
- **Seek alternate angles** if opponents remain hidden, trying to find another direction to shoot from

This makes them more dangerous than typical cultists, as they conserve ammunition and wait for clear shots.

### Crouching Fire

Corrupted Officers can crouch while firing, an ability only they and Adepts can use. When crouching, opponents suffer -1 to SKILL when attacking them at Medium or Long range, but the Officer suffers no penalty to SKILL when firing while crouched. This makes them harder to hit while maintaining their accuracy.

### Deadly Precision

Corrupted Officers are deadly accurate, especially when in large groups. When three or more Corrupted Officers are present, each gains +1 to SKILL for ranged attacks, representing their ability to coordinate fire and create crossfire situations. Their Magnum Revolvers pack a punch, making them dangerous even at medium range.

### Undead Resilience

As undead creatures reanimated through dark magic, Corrupted Officers gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious. They may continue fighting for one additional round after being reduced to 0 STAMINA before dying. They are immune to fear effects and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with.

### Police Training

Corrupted Officers retain their law enforcement training. They gain +1 to SKILL for tactical positioning and may use cover effectively. They understand police tactics and can anticipate opponent movements, making them more dangerous than typical cultists.

### Group Tactics

Corrupted Officers attack in groups and use coordinated tactics. When multiple Officers are present, they can:

- **Coordinate fire** - Focus fire on priority targets
- **Flank opponents** - Use their tactical fire control to find alternate angles
- **Create crossfire** - Position themselves to catch opponents in crossfire

### Cult Mark

The mark of the Cult sliced upon their chests is visible through their unbuttoned shirts. This mark is a clear indicator of their corruption and cannot be hidden. The mark may have supernatural significance, binding them to the Cult's will.

## In Play

Corrupted Officers serve as:

- **Tactical threats** - Using cover and fire control effectively
- **Precise shooters** - Deadly accurate, especially in groups
- **Group combatants** - Attacking in coordinated groups
- **Undead enemies** - Reanimated through dark magic
- **Corruption symbols** - Representing the Cult's infiltration of law enforcement

### Game Considerations

- Corrupted Officers are more dangerous than typical cultists due to their tactical behavior
- Their ability to hold fire makes them conserve ammunition and wait for clear shots
- They will seek alternate angles if opponents remain hidden
- Their Magnum Revolvers pack a punch - don't stand out in the open to tank damage
- Headshots are preferable - handguns, revolvers, lever-action rifles, and FG-42 are great options
- At close range, shotguns, STEN, and SASG are alternatives
- Shields are a great way to reach them and get a better shot
- They attack in groups, making them particularly dangerous
- Their crouching ability makes them harder to hit at range
- They are undead and cannot be intimidated or negotiated with
- They drop 3 magnum rounds when destroyed
- Their police uniforms and Cult marks make them easily identifiable
- They represent the corruption of law enforcement by the Cult
