# Street Gang Thug

**Type:** Urban street criminal / Minion  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

**Street Gang Thugs** are violent street-level criminals who operate in urban neighborhoods, preying on civilians and engaging in random acts of violence. Inspired by the brutal thugs of the Death Wish series, these criminals are opportunistic predators who use intimidation and violence to get what they want. They're less organized than full gang members but just as dangerous, operating in small groups to overwhelm victims.

## Characteristics

Street Gang Thugs are:

- **Violent** - Willing to use extreme violence for small gains
- **Opportunistic** - Prey on vulnerable targets
- **Cowardly** - Prefer overwhelming odds and easy targets
- **Impulsive** - Act without planning or consideration
- **Desperate** - Driven by immediate need for money or respect
- **Unpredictable** - May escalate violence unexpectedly

## Equipment

Street Gang Thugs typically carry:

- **Melee weapons** - Knives, baseball bats, chains, pipes, or improvised weapons
- **Handguns** - Cheap revolvers or stolen pistols (if available)
- **Improvised weapons** - Bottles, bricks, or anything available
- **Stolen items** - May carry items from recent robberies
- **Street clothes** - No distinctive gang colors, blending into urban environment

## Abilities

### Overwhelming Numbers

Street Gang Thugs prefer to attack in groups. When three or more thugs are present, each gains +1 to damage rolls as they coordinate to overwhelm their target.

### Coward's Advantage

Street Gang Thugs will flee if the fight turns against them. When reduced to 3 STAMINA or less, they must make a SKILL test or flee. However, if they outnumber their opponents 2-to-1 or more, they gain +1 to SKILL.

### Opportunistic Strike

Street Gang Thugs excel at ambushing vulnerable targets. When attacking from surprise or against an unaware target, they gain +2 to SKILL for the first attack.

### Intimidation

Street Gang Thugs use threats and violence to intimidate. Opponents must make a Willpower or LUCK test (GM's choice) or suffer -1 to SKILL for the first round when facing multiple thugs.

## In Play

Street Gang Thugs serve as:

- **Random encounters** - Opportunistic street crime
- **Combat encounters** - Violent but less skilled than organized criminals
- **Urban threats** - Creating danger in city environments
- **Moral dilemmas** - May be desperate rather than purely evil
- **Information sources** - May know about local criminal activity if intimidated

### Game Considerations

- Thugs are dangerous in groups but less effective individually
- They prefer easy targets and will flee if outmatched
- Their opportunistic nature makes them unpredictable
- They may provide information if properly intimidated
- They often operate in areas with little police presence
- Their violence is often random and senseless
