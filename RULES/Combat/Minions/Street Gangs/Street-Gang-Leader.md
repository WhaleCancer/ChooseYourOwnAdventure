### Leadership

Street Gang Leaders can command other gang members. When leading other gang members, the leader grants +1 to SKILL to all gang members in the encounter for coordination and combat actions.

Street Gang Leaders inspire fear and respect. Opponents must make a Willpower or LUCK test (GM's choice) or suffer -1 to SKILL for the first round of combat when facing a leader.

### Strategic Thinking

Street Gang Leaders are more tactical than regular members. They gain +1 to SKILL for awareness tests and may act first in surprise situations.

Street Gang Leaders have connections to larger criminal organizations. If a leader is eliminated, the gang may fragment, or larger organizations may investigate or retaliate.

### Survival Instinct

Street Gang Leaders have survived through years of violence. They gain +1 to STAMINA for the purpose of determining when they fall unconscious, and may attempt to flee if the situation becomes hopeless.
