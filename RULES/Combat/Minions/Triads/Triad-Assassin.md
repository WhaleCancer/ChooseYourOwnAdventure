## Abilities

### Stealth Mastery

Triad Assassins are masters of stealth. They gain +2 to SKILL for stealth-related actions, and may appear suddenly from concealment, gaining +3 to SKILL for the first attack if they successfully ambush opponents.

### Precision Elimination

Triad Assassins are skilled at targeting vital points. When making attacks against unaware or surprised targets, they gain +2 to damage and may attempt to eliminate targets with a single strike (GM's discretion).

### Patient Hunter

Triad Assassins will wait for the perfect opportunity. They can observe targets for extended periods, learning patterns and weaknesses, granting +1 to SKILL for all attacks against observed targets.

### Escape Artist

Triad Assassins are skilled at escaping after completing their mission. They gain +2 to SKILL for movement and evasion actions, and may use their knowledge of the area to escape.

### Ninja-Style Dodging

Like the Evil Ninjas of Shadow Warrior, Triad Assassins can dodge incoming attacks with acrobatic movements. When targeted by ranged attacks, they may make a SKILL test to dodge, avoiding the attack entirely on success. This ability can be used once per round.

### Multiple Methods

Triad Assassins are trained in multiple methods of elimination. They can use firearms, melee weapons, shurikens, or improvised methods, adapting to the situation as needed. Like the ninja enemies of Shadow Warrior, they are versatile and dangerous with any weapon.

### Shuriken Mastery

Triad Assassins can throw shurikens with deadly accuracy. When throwing shurikens, they gain +1 to SKILL and the shuriken deals 2-4 damage at Short/Medium range. Shurikens are silent and can be used for stealthy ranged attacks.

## In Play

Triad Assassins serve as:

- **Elite threats** - Most dangerous individual opponents
- **Elimination** - Sent to eliminate specific high-value targets
- **Stealth encounters** - Operating in the shadows
- **Boss encounters** - Often appear as major antagonists
- **Mystery elements** - Their presence indicates serious threats

### Game Considerations

- Assassins are extremely dangerous and should be treated as elite enemies
- They often operate alone and prefer stealth over direct confrontation
- Their precision makes them deadly even when outnumbered
- They may have knowledge of organization operations and targets
- Their stealth makes them difficult to detect or track
- They represent the highest level of organized crime violence
