## Abilities

### Police Training

RCMP Constables are trained in federal law enforcement procedures. They gain +1 to SKILL for awareness tests and detecting criminal activity, and may act first in surprise situations.

### Backup Request

RCMP Constables can call for backup. When in danger or facing threats, they can request assistance, potentially bringing additional officers to the scene within 1d6+2 rounds.

### Authority

RCMP Constables have federal legal authority. They can make arrests, issue commands, and use force when necessary. Opponents may be intimidated by their authority, suffering -1 to SKILL for the first round when facing RCMP.

### Independent Operations

RCMP Constables often operate independently in remote areas. They gain +1 to SKILL for operating alone or in small groups, representing their ability to handle diverse situations without immediate support.

## In Play

RCMP Constables serve as:

- **Law enforcement** - Enforcing federal laws and maintaining order
- **First responders** - Responding to calls in rural and urban areas
- **Combat encounters** - Well-trained but not specialized for combat
- **Information sources** - Knowledge of local crime and activities
- **Potential allies** - May assist legitimate investigations
- **Obstacles** - May interfere with illegal activities

### Game Considerations

- Constables are professional law enforcement, not criminals
- They will follow proper procedures and call for backup
- Their federal authority extends across jurisdictions
- They may be more willing to negotiate than specialized units
- They often work alone or in pairs, especially in rural areas
- Their presence indicates active federal law enforcement
