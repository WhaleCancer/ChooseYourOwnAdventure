# Melee Combat

When two enemies fight each other in hand-to-hand combat, the attacker makes an attack roll against a target number. The target number is modified by the defender's skill level.

## The Attacker

The attacker rolls **2D6** and adds their **PHYSICAL rating** plus an appropriate Skill (see Attacker Skills below).

### Attacker Skills

The attacker uses one of the following skills when making a melee attack:

- **[Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md)** - For unarmed combat, knives, or improvised weapons
- **[Melee Weapons](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md)** - For swords, axes, clubs, staves, polearms, and other traditional melee weapons
  - [Axes](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Axes.md)
  - [Clubs](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Clubs.md)
  - [Polearms](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Polearms.md)
  - [Staves](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Staves.md)
  - [Swords](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Swords.md)
- **[Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md)** - For unarmed combat using martial arts techniques

## The Target Number and Defender

The base target number is **14**. The defender adds their skill level to this target number. The defender typically uses their weapon skill (from the Attacker Skills list above), but may use alternative skills in certain situations.

### Defender Skills

The defender adds their skill level to the target number using one of the following options:

- **Weapon Skill** (default) - The defender adds their weapon skill level (from the Attacker Skills list above) to the target number. [Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) cannot be used as a defender skill against [Melee Weapons](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md) or [Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md), except when the attacker is using a melee weapon but has insufficient skill to wield it properly. In that case, the defender may use Brawling.
- **[Armor](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md)** - Used by defenders wielding a shield; the defender may add either their Armor skill level or their weapon skill level to the target number.
- **[Dodge](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md)** - Used by defenders who are not wearing armor; the defender may use their Dodge skill level instead of their weapon skill, adding it to the target number.

## Resolution

If the attacker's roll meets or exceeds the modified target number, they hit and inflict damage. If the roll is less than the target number, the attack misses. See [Critical Hits](Critical%20Hits.md) for special results on double 6, and [Fumbles](Fumbles.md) for special results on double 1.

The attacker will roll another D6 and compare the roll to their weapon damage table. The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS damage inflicted. The defender also rolls a D6 and compares the value to their [Armor](Armor-Rimworld.md) or [Dodge](Dodge.md) table (whichever they are using). The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the losing character.

If a character's STAMINA POINTS are reduced to 0 or lower, see [Death and Dying](Death%20and%20Dying.md) for the rules on unconsciousness, dying, and death.

Once all of this has been worked out for all combats taking place, the round is over and the next one will start.

## Leaving Melee Combat

Melee combat occurs when a character is adjacent to an enemy who is wielding a melee weapon. [Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md) counts as a melee weapon for this purpose. [Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) weapons such as brass knuckles or knives do not count as melee weapons for this purpose.

In order to escape from melee combat, a character must, at the start of the round, either make a successful [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) Skill roll (using PHYSICAL) or Test their LUCK. If this roll is failed, the character or monster must remain in melee combat that round and fight on, or else be automatically hit once by every enemy they are facing. They may of course re-attempt to leave on the following round.

If the [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) or LUCK test is successful, the combatant may leave the melee without incident and move away.
