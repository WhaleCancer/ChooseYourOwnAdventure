# Multiple Monsters

When creatures with multiple Attacks face fewer opponents than they have attacks available, they can focus their unused attacks into combat bonuses, making them more dangerous when outnumbered.

In a situation where melee attacks are being targeted all over the place, it is essential that the Director knows who is attacking whom. Every combatant should then calculate their combat total. Use the principle that if a one way attack total beats the defender, a hit is scored and damage is done, but if the attacker gets a lower total, the attack misses and nothing further happens.

A creature with more than one Attack can simultaneously attack multiple enemies, rolling separately for each. A creature is only outnumbered if the number of enemies they face is more than the number of Attacks they have.

## Multiple Attack System

Creatures with multiple Attacks can engage multiple opponents simultaneously. The system determines how many attacks can be made and what happens when a creature has more attacks than available targets.

## Standard Rules

A creature with more than one Attack can simultaneously attack multiple enemies:

- They roll separately for each attack.
- They are only outnumbered if the number of enemies they face is **more than** the number of Attacks they have.
- If a creature with three Attacks faces three Heroes, all three can be attacked.
- If the same creature faces a single Hero, only one attack may be made.

**Example**: A Giant with three Attacks fighting three Heroes can attack all three Heroes, rolling separately for each attack.

**Example**: If the same Giant faces only one Hero, they can only make one attack against that Hero.

## Alternative Rule: Unused Attack Bonuses

**Note:** This is an alternative rule. In EPIC, this rule is in full effect.

In standard Advanced Fighting Fantasy rules, a creature with more than one Attack can simultaneously attack multiple enemies, rolling separately for each. A creature is only outnumbered if the number of enemies they face is more than the number of Attacks they have.

The **Unused Attack Bonuses** rule makes creatures with multiple attacks more dangerous when they cannot use all of their attacks, as unused attacks translate into combat bonuses.

### Unused Attack Bonuses

Every Attack that a monster is not able to use (because they do not have enough opponents to attack) translates into a bonus of **+2 to an attack they do make**.

**Example**: A Giant with three Attacks fights two Heroes. The Giant has one "unused" attack and thus can apply a **+2 bonus** to one of the combat rolls they make.

**Example**: If the Giant defeats one of the Heroes and is now fighting only one, they would have two "unused" attacks and would have a bonus of **+4** against that final Hero.

### Restrictions

- The **+2 bonus may not be split** between multiple attacks.
- The bonus **must be assigned at the beginning of the round**.
- A monster **may not voluntarily keep attacks unused** if they have enough opponents.

**Example**: If a Giant with three Attacks is fighting three Heroes, they cannot choose to make only two attacks in order to get a +2 bonus from the unused attack. The Giant **MUST attack all three Heroes**.

## Using Multiple Monsters in Play

- When a creature with multiple Attacks faces fewer opponents than their Attack value, calculate unused attacks.
- Each unused attack provides a +2 bonus to one attack roll.
- The bonus must be assigned at the beginning of the combat round.
- The bonus cannot be split between multiple attacks.
- Creatures cannot voluntarily hold back attacks if they have enough opponents to use all attacks.

### Multiple Monsters in Combat

**Outnumbering:** A creature is only outnumbered if the number of enemies they face is **more than** the number of Attacks they have. A creature with three Attacks facing three Heroes is not outnumbered.

**Unused Attacks:** When a creature has more Attacks than opponents, unused Attacks become combat bonuses. A creature with three Attacks facing one Hero gets +4 to their single attack (two unused attacks × +2 each).

**Tactical Implications:** This rule makes powerful multi-attack creatures significantly more dangerous when facing fewer opponents, encouraging Heroes to work together and maintain numerical advantages in combat.

**Multiple Opponents:** When a creature faces multiple opponents equal to or less than their Attack value, they can attack all opponents, rolling separately for each attack.
