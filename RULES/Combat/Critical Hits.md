# Critical Hits

If a Character rolls a double 6 when making their combat roll, they will automatically hit their target even if their combat total would normally result in a miss. However, a Critical Hit only occurs if the attack would have hit normally (i.e., the combat total would have been successful). If the double 6 only serves to turn a miss into a hit, the attack inflicts normal damage only. When a Critical Hit does occur, it will normally inflict a lot of damage to the target, and may even kill them outright. The Critical Hit is resolved by rolling 2D6 and consulting the appropriate table below.

A Character may, before the Critical Hit is resolved, Test their LUCK if they suffer a critical themselves. If successful, the critical hit is reduced to a normal hit, inflicting only normal damage with no critical effects.
