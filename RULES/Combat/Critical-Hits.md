If a Character or other character rolls a double 6 when making their combat roll, they will automatically win that combat round (even if their total is lower than that of their enemy) and moreover will inflict a Critical Hit. This will normally inflict a lot of damage to the target, and may even kill them outright. The Critical Hit is resolved by rolling 2D6 and consulting the appropriate table below.

A Character may, before the Critical Hit is resolved, make a LUCK test if they suffer a critical themselves. If successful, the critical hit inflicts double the normal rolled damage (armour applies as normal) but no further effects.

Obviously, taking a Critical Hit can be brutal, and could incapacitate or kill a Character. Much of this damage can be repaired at a later date (depending on the setting) but a roll of double 6 against a Character can often change the direction of a game session.

If a combat roll is a double 6, that combatant will automatically win that combat round regardless of combat totals. In addition, the blow is a critical hit and will inflict more damage. The winner makes their damage roll as normal, but the amount of damage that results from the table is doubled. Armour then applies as normal. The loser of that round must also reduce their current SKILL score by 1 due to muscle and bone damage.

If both combatants roll a double 6, then both will inflict double damage on each other, as both inflict devastating blows.
