# Defense Resolution

## Defending

If the player's defense roll is under the modified value, they avoid the attack. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, they are hit.

If the player is hit, the attacker determines damage from their weapon's [damage track](../../Weapons/Canada%20198X/_Ranged/Rifles/Battle%20Rifle.md#damage-track). The player then rolls a D6 and compares the value to their [Armor](../Armor-Rimworld.md) or [Dodge](../Dodge.md) protection track (whichever they are using). The value from that track is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the player's current STAMINA POINTS.

If a character's STAMINA POINTS are reduced to 0 or lower, see [Death and Dying](../Death%20and%20Dying.md) for the rules on unconsciousness, dying, and death.

## Critical Hits and Fumbles when Defending

When rolling 2D6 for defense, certain dice combinations produce special results regardless of the roll total:

- **Double 6:** The attacker fumbles their attack and the Character automatically avoids the attack regardless of the roll result. See [Fumbles](../Fumbles.md) for details on what happens to the attacker.
- **Double 1:** The attacker scores a critical hit and the Character automatically fails to defend, being hit with a critical hit. See [Critical Hits](../Critical%20Hits.md) for details.
