# When a Player Attacks

The player rolls **2D6** and must roll **under** their **PHYSICAL rating** plus their appropriate Skill (see the skill lists below for each attack type), minus any [combat modifiers](../Combat%20Modifiers.md) that apply. The exact formula depends on whether the attack is melee or ranged.

## Melee Attacks

For melee attacks, the defender's skill level reduces the attacker's roll.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Character's PHYSICAL + Character's Skill - Opponent's Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The attacker uses one of the following skills when making a melee attack:

- **[Brawling](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md)** - For unarmed combat, knives, or improvised weapons
- **[Melee Weapons](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md)** - For [swords](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Swords.md), [axes](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Axes.md), [clubs](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Clubs.md), [staves](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Staves.md), [polearms](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Polearms.md), and other traditional melee weapons
- **[Martial Arts](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md)** - For unarmed combat using martial arts techniques

## Ranged Attacks

For ranged attacks, the defender's weapon skill does not reduce the attacker's roll. However, the defender may use Dodge or Armor (with shield) to defend, and the Director may provide other modifiers.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Character's PHYSICAL + Character's Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The attacker uses one of the following skills when making a ranged attack:

- **[Firearms-Light](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light.md)** - For [pistols](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/Pistols.md), [rifles](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/Rifles.md), [shotguns](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/Shotguns.md), [SMGs](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/SMGs.md), and other light firearms
- **[Firearms-Heavy](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy.md)** - For [heavy machine guns](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy/Heavy-Machine-Guns.md), [launchers](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy/Launchers.md), [energy throwers](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy/Energy-Throwers.md), and other heavy weapons
- **[Missile Weapons](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Missile-Weapons.md)** - For [bows](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Missile%20Weapons/Bows.md), [thrown weapons](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Missile%20Weapons/Thrown.md), and other missile weapons

> ### At the Table
>
> First, determine the target number. The Player provides their Character's PHYSICAL rating, their Character's skill level, and any applicable combat modifiers. The Director provides the opponent's skill level (if any) or any modifiers not accounted for (such as special abilities). Once the target number is determined, to speed up play, players can roll 4D6 at once for each attack: 2 white dice for the attack roll, 1 red D6 for damage, and 1 black D6 for the armor track.
