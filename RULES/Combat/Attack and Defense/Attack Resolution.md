# Attack Resolution

## Attacking

If the player's attack roll is under the modified value, they hit and inflict damage. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, the attack misses.

If the attack hits, the player rolls another D6 and compares the roll to their weapon's [damage track](../../Weapons/Canada%20198X/_Ranged/Rifles/Battle%20Rifle.md#damage-track). The value from that track is the amount of STAMINA POINTS damage inflicted. The defender then rolls a D6 and compares the value to their [Armor](../Armor-Rimworld.md) or [Dodge](../Dodge.md) protection track (whichever they are using). The value from that track is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the target.

## Critical Hits and Fumbles when Attacking

When rolling 2D6 for an attack, certain dice combinations produce special results regardless of the roll total:

- **Double 6:** The attack automatically hits and inflicts a critical hit. See [Critical Hits](../Critical%20Hits.md) for details.
- **Double 1:** The attack automatically misses and the Character fumbles. See [Fumbles](../Fumbles.md) for details.
