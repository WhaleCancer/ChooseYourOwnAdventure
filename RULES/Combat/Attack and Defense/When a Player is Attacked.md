# When a Player is Attacked

When a player is attacked, they roll **2D6** and must roll **under** the attacker's **PHYSICAL rating** plus the attacker's skill level, minus the player's appropriate Skill (see Defender Skills below), minus any [combat modifiers](../Combat%20Modifiers.md) that apply. If the player's defense roll is under this modified value, they avoid the attack. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, they are hit. The exact formula and available skills depend on whether the attack is melee or ranged.

## Defending Against Melee Attacks

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Opponent's PHYSICAL + Opponent's Skill - Character's Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The player uses one of the following skills when defending against a melee attack. The player's skill level is **subtracted** from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill), making it easier to defend:

- **Weapon Skill** (default) - The player subtracts their weapon skill level (from the Melee Attacker Skills list in [When a Player Attacks](When%20a%20Player%20Attacks.md)) from the opponent's ability. [Brawling](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) cannot be used as a defender skill against [Melee Weapons](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md) or [Martial Arts](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md), except when the attacker is using a melee weapon but has insufficient skill to wield it properly. In that case, the defender may use Brawling.
- **[Armor](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md)** - Used by defenders wielding a shield; the player may subtract either their Armor skill level or their weapon skill level from the opponent's ability.
- **[Dodge](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md)** - Used by defenders who are not wearing armor; the player may use their Dodge skill level instead of their weapon skill, subtracting it from the opponent's ability.

## Defending Against Ranged Attacks

**Weapon skills cannot be used to defend against ranged attacks** - only Dodge or Armor (with shield) may be used.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Opponent's PHYSICAL + Opponent's Skill - Character's Dodge/Armor Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The player uses one of the following skills when defending against a ranged attack. The player's skill level is **subtracted** from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill), making it easier to defend:

- **[Dodge](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md)** - The player may use their Dodge skill level, subtracting it from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill). This represents evasive movement and taking cover.
- **[Armor](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md)** - Used by defenders wielding a shield; the player may subtract their Armor skill level from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill).

> ### At the Table
>
> First, determine the target number. The Director provides the opponent's PHYSICAL rating and skill level (the base target number), while the Player provides the Character's skill level (or Dodge/Armor skill for ranged attacks) and any applicable combat modifiers to subtract from the target number. Once the target number is determined, to speed up play, players can roll 4D6 at once when defending: 2 white dice for the defense roll, 1 red D6 for damage (if hit), and 1 black D6 for the armor track.
