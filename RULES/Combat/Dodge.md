# Dodge

Any character with the **[Dodge](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md) special skill** may use it instead of armour to reduce damage from an attack. When hit, a character can reduce damage by getting out of the way, functioning similarly to armor but with damage reduction determined by their Dodge skill level.

## Rules

### Dodge Protection Track

When a character using Dodge is hit, roll 1D6 and consult the table below. The value shown is how many points of damage are **subtracted** from the incoming damage.

| Dodge Special Skill | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7+ |
|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| 1                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2  |
| 2                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2  |
| 3                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3  |
| 4                   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3  |
| 5                   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4  |
| 6                   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  |

A Character may receive bonuses to this dodge roll from Talents, Spells or Priestly powers, which may increase the result to a 7 or more.

### Additional Rules

- **Swashbuckler Bonus:** If a character has the [Swashbuckler](../../Talents/Swashbuckler.md) talent, they gain a **+1 bonus to Dodge protection rolls**, much as the [Armor Training](../../Talents/Armor-Training.md) talent does for actual armour.
- **Mutual Exclusion with Armor:** A character may choose at the start of each round whether to reduce damage with their armour or their Dodge. These protections **do not stack**.
- **Shield Stacking:** A shield **may stack with Dodge** as it does with armour. The protection provided by a shield is added to the Dodge protection roll.

## Using Dodge in Play

- When an attack hits, first roll the **weapon's damage track** to determine damage, then roll the **dodge protection track** and subtract the two.
- If the result is **zero or less**, the attack fails to harm the target (though it may still knock them down, tear clothing, or create narrative consequences).
- Dodge provides an alternative to armor for characters who prefer mobility and agility over heavy protection.
- Any character with Dodge skill can use it; the [Swashbuckler](../../Talents/Swashbuckler.md) talent provides a +1 bonus to Dodge rolls but is not required.
