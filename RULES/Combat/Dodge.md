# Dodge

## Standard Rules

In Advanced Fighting Fantasy, only a character with the **Swashbuckler talent** may use their Dodge special skill to avoid damage in combat, in the same way that armour reduces damage.

A Hero with the **Swashbuckler talent** and points in the **Dodge special skill** can reduce damage from a successful hit by getting out of the way. This functions similarly to armor, but the damage reduction is determined by the Hero's Dodge skill level.

### Standard Restrictions

- Dodging **cannot** be used if the Hero is wearing armor or actively using a Shield to block attacks.
- A Hero merely **carrying** a Shield (but not using it for blocking) can still make a Dodge roll but gains no additional benefit from the Shield itself for that roll.
- The Swashbuckler talent is required to use Dodge; without it, a Hero cannot dodge attacks regardless of Dodge skill level.

## Alternative Rule: Ubiquitous Dodging

**Note:** This is an alternative rule. If this rule is used, it replaces the standard Dodge restrictions above.

If this alternative rule is used, **any character with the Dodge special skill** may use that instead of armour to reduce damage from an attack, regardless of whether they have the Swashbuckler talent.

### Ubiquitous Dodging Rules

- **Swashbuckler Bonus:** If a character also has the Swashbuckler talent, this now applies a **+1 bonus to any "armour" rolls made using the Dodge special skill**, much as the "Armour Training" talent does for actual armour.
- **Mutual Exclusion with Armor:** A character may choose at the start of each round whether to reduce damage with their armour or their Dodge. These protections **do not stack**.
- **Shield Stacking:** A shield **may stack with Dodge** as it does with armour. The protection provided by a shield is added to the Dodge protection roll.

## Dodge Protection Track

When a character using Dodge (either with Swashbuckler talent under standard rules, or with any Dodge skill under Ubiquitous Dodging) is hit, roll 1D6 and consult the table below. The value shown is how many points of damage are **subtracted** from the incoming damage.

| Dodge Special Skill | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7+ |
|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| 1                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2  |
| 2                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2  |
| 3                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3  |
| 4                   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3  |
| 5                   | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4  |
| 6                   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  |

A Hero may receive bonuses to this dodge roll from Talents, Spells or Priestly powers, which may increase the result to a 7 or more.

## Using Dodge in Play

- When an attack hits, first roll the **weapon's damage track** to determine damage, then roll the **dodge protection track** and subtract the two.
- If the result is **zero or less**, the attack fails to harm the target (though it may still knock them down, tear clothing, or create narrative consequences).
- Dodge provides an alternative to armor for Heroes who prefer mobility and agility over heavy protection.
- **With Standard Rules:** The Swashbuckler talent is required to use Dodge; without it, a Hero cannot dodge attacks regardless of Dodge skill level.
- **With Ubiquitous Dodging:** Any character with Dodge skill can use it, and Swashbuckler provides a +1 bonus to Dodge rolls instead of being required.
