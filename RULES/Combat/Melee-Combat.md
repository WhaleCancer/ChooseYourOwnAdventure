# Melee Combat

When two enemies fight each other in hand-to-hand combat, both roll 2D6 and add the total to their PHYSICAL rating plus an appropriate Special Skill. The sum of all of these values is the "Combat Total" for that fighter. Whichever fighter has the greater Combat Total wins that round and inflicts damage on the loser. However, if a tie is achieved in hand-to-hand combat, neither opponent takes any damage on that round.

The winner will roll another D6 and compare the roll to their weapon damage table. The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS damage inflicted. The loser also rolls a D6 and compares the value to their Armor table. The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the losing character.

Once all of this has been worked out for all combats taking place, the round is over and the next one will start.

## Fighting Multiple Enemies

In a situation where melee attacks are being targeted all over the place, it is essential that the Director knows who is attacking whom. Every combatant should then calculate their combat total. Use the principle that if a one way attack total beats the defender, a hit is scored and damage is done, but if the attacker gets a lower total, the attack misses and nothing further happens.

## Leaving Combat

In order to escape from combat, a character must, at the start of the round, either make a successful Athletics Special Skill roll (using PHYSICAL) or Test their LUCK. If this roll is failed, the character or monster must remain in combat that round and fight on, or else be automatically hit once by every enemy they are facing. They may of course re-attempt to leave on the following round.

If the Athletics or LUCK test is successful, the combatant may leave the melee without incident and move a short distance away. What happens after that will very much be up to the Director and determined by the situation.
