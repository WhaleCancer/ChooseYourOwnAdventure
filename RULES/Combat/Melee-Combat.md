# Melee Combat

When two enemies fight each other in hand-to-hand combat, the attacker rolls 2D6 and adds their PHYSICAL rating plus an appropriate Skill (see Melee Combat Skills below). The target number to hit is **14**, modified by the defender's weapon skill level (from the Melee Combat Skills below), which is added to the target number.

## Melee Combat Skills

The attacker uses one of the following skills when making a melee attack:

- **[Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md)** - For unarmed combat, knives, or improvised weapons
- **[Melee Weapons](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md)** - For swords, axes, clubs, staves, polearms, and other traditional melee weapons
  - [Axes](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Axes.md)
  - [Clubs](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Clubs.md)
  - [Polearms](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Polearms.md)
  - [Staves](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Staves.md)
  - [Swords](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee Weapons/Swords.md)
- **[Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md)** - For unarmed combat using martial arts techniques

The defender typically uses their weapon skill (from the list above) to add to the target number. However, the following skills may also be used by the defender:

- **[Armor](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md)** - Used by defenders wielding a shield; the defender may add their Armor skill level OR their weapon skill level to the target number
- **[Dodge](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md)** - Used by defenders who are not wearing armor; the defender may use their Dodge skill level instead of their weapon skill, adding it to the target number

## Resolution

If the attacker's roll meets or exceeds the modified target number, they hit and inflict damage. If the roll is less than the target number, the attack misses. See [Critical Hits](Critical%20Hits.md) for special results on double 6, and [Fumbles](Fumbles.md) for special results on double 1.

The attacker will roll another D6 and compare the roll to their weapon damage table. The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS damage inflicted. The defender also rolls a D6 and compares the value to their [Armor](Armor-Rimworld.md) or [Dodge](Dodge.md) table (whichever they are using). The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the losing character.

Once all of this has been worked out for all combats taking place, the round is over and the next one will start.

## Leaving Melee Combat

Melee combat occurs when a character is adjacent to an enemy who is wielding a melee weapon. [Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md) counts as a melee weapon for this purpose. [Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) weapons such as brass knuckles or knives do not count as melee weapons for this purpose.

In order to escape from melee combat, a character must, at the start of the round, either make a successful [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) Skill roll (using PHYSICAL) or Test their LUCK. If this roll is failed, the character or monster must remain in melee combat that round and fight on, or else be automatically hit once by every enemy they are facing. They may of course re-attempt to leave on the following round.

If the [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) or LUCK test is successful, the combatant may leave the melee without incident and move away.
