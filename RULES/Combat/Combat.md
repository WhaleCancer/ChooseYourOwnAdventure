# Combat Rules

## Overview

Almost any sci-fi adventure will feature a combat at some point, even if it is not the main focus of the campaign.

The rules for combat are, in general, just as easy as those for any other situation.

As in most other RPG's, combat is split into rounds, each of which is about 10 seconds long. During this round, each character may take one main action, the most common being to attack an enemy.

## Combat Structure

- **[Order Of Actions](./Order-of-Actions.md)** - How actions are resolved in a round
- **[Attack and Defense](./Attack%20and%20Defense.md)** - Melee and ranged combat rules
- **[Critical Hits](./Critical-Hits.md)** - Extraordinary successes
- **[Fumbles](./Fumbles.md)** - Catastrophic failures
- **[Powerful Attacks](./#Powerful Attacks.md)** - Overwhelming strikes
- **[Death And Dying](./Death-and-Dying.md)** - What happens when STAMINA POINTS reach 0

## Order of Actions

See **[Order Of Actions](./Order-of-Actions.md)** for detailed rules on how actions are resolved in combat rounds, including delaying actions and early actions.

## Combat Resolution

See **[Attack and Defense](./Attack%20and%20Defense.md)** for detailed rules on melee and ranged combat, including attack and defense rolls, damage, and armor.

## Critical Hits

See **[Critical Hits](./Critical-Hits.md)** for detailed rules on critical hits, including automatic wins, damage, and LUCK tests.

## Fumbles

See **[Fumbles](./Fumbles.md)** for detailed rules on fumbles, including automatic losses and LUCK tests.

## Powerful Attacks

If an attack roll beats an opponent by six points or more (and is not a Critical or Fumble), the Attack will do double normal damage, before armor is applied. This blow can, in some cases, be sufficient on its own to defeat a minor enemy. All relevant modifiers should apply to both combatants for this difference to be worked out.

If however the attack roll beats the total of the opponent by twelve points or more and is not a Fumble, the enemy will be instantly defeated. If the combatant instantly defeated is an Character, they are reduced to zero STAMINA POINTS. If the defeated warrior is a monster or NPC, they can be considered immediately killed.

Of course, both of these options assume that the victorious warrior is able to actually harm their opponent, that they have not chosen the "Defensive" combat option and that the target is the one whom the victor is actually attacking.

## Surprise

If the Characters (or their opponents) are attempting to ambush their enemies, then initially an Awareness or Stealth Special Skill test must be made to determine if the ambushers are seen. If the ambusher(s) remains unseen, the resulting attack is made with a +6 bonus to the combat total. If the ambusher attacks successfully, there is an additional +2 modifier to the damage roll. If the defender wins, they do not inflict any damage, merely avoid the ambush attack.

## Movement and Ranges

In an enclosed space, such as a starship bridge, spaceport bar or hangar, a note of relative position is all that is required. There are no long distances or ranges involved, and given a clear run, a character could cross the space in a round or two. It is important to note who is in hand to hand contact with whom, who is shooting at a character etc.

In a larger area, it is probably worth using the weapon range categories, which are:

| Range        | Description                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Point Blank  | (within melee weapon range)    |
| Very Short   | (a room distance apart)        |
| Short        | (maybe 50-100 yards)           |
| Medium       | (able to clearly see a face)   |
| Long         | (200-300 yards)                |
| Very Long    | (within clear sight range)     |

You can move one weapon range category and make an attack or take another substantial action. Alternatively, you can move two weapon range categories without taking any other actions.

If one weapon range category was moved, anyone attacking such a moving target will have their fixed ranged combat target number increased by one. If a moving target instead moves two weapon range categories, it increases by two instead.

### Movement Modifiers

- Bloodied: 1/2 move; i.e. takes two rounds to clear a range
- Total darkness (even with night vision)
- Nighttime darkness (without night vision)
- Trying to be stealthy
- Difficult terrain such as heavy snow or undergrowth
- Carrying more than maximum encumbrance

### Using LUCK to Ignore Movement Penalties

If an Character needs to get somewhere, but their movement has been restricted by any of the above reasons, they can spend a LUCK to ignore a single penalty that round. They may not use LUCK to ignore more than one penalty in a given round.

## Death & Dying

See **[Death And Dying](./Death-and-Dying.md)** for detailed rules on what happens when STAMINA POINTS reach 0, including death mechanics, First Aid, and the dying process.
