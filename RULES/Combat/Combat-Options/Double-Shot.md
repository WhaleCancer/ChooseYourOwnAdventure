# Double Shot

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

To use this combat option the Hero must be using a bow or Crossbow. The Hero fires two arrows or bolts with a single shot. It is difficult to pull off, and can only be used at Short range, but inflicts +2 STAMINA damage if the attack hits. However, this attack will Fumble on a roll of 2-4 rather than just a 2.

## Sebastian's Notes

This option is used for weapons that have a 2 or 3 round burst capability. When using burst fire, the weapon fires multiple projectiles as a single attack action. The weapon must have burst fire capability and sufficient ammunition remaining. This attack will Fumble on a roll of 2-4 rather than just a 2, representing the increased difficulty of controlling burst fire accurately.

Unlike Rapid Shot, which allows two separate attack rolls that can target different enemies, Double Shot (burst fire) is a single attack against one target with increased damage potential but a higher fumble risk.

For example, a weapon with a 2 or 3 round burst selector could perform a Double Shot, while a fully automatic weapon without burst capability would use Hyperfire instead, and a bolt-action rifle could not perform this action.

### Homebrew Wording

A character with a weapon that has 2 or 3 round burst capability may choose to use Double Shot (for 2-round burst) or Triple Shot (for 3-round burst), firing a burst of projectiles as a single attack action. The weapon must have burst fire capability and sufficient ammunition remaining. This is difficult to pull off, and can only be used at Short range, but inflicts +2 STAMINA damage if the attack hits. However, this attack will Fumble on a roll of 2-4 rather than just a 2, representing the increased difficulty of controlling burst fire accurately.
