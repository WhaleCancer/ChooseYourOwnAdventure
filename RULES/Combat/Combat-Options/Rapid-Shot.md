# Rapid Shot

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed ([Page 65](../../../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0065.png))

Applicable only to attacks with bows or thrown daggers, this attack gets two missiles off in very quick succession, albeit with less power. The Hero may make two separate attack rolls against the same or different opponents in the same round, with a -3 penalty to both. If either of these hit, only 1D3 is rolled for the damage roll. Any modifiers to the damage roll are applied as normal.

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

An attacker using this option may make two separate shots in a round. If two separate enemies are targeted, separate attack rolls must be made at a penalty of -3. A D3 should be used to make the damage roll(s) rather than a D6. Modifiers to the damage roll will still apply to both damage rolls.

## Sebastian's Notes

This option can be adapted for modern weapons capable of firing multiple shots in quick succession. Unlike Double Shot, which fires two projectiles as a single attack with increased damage, Rapid Shot allows the character to make two separate attack rolls that can target the same or different opponents. Each attack suffers a -3 penalty, and damage is rolled with 1D3 rather than 1D6. This represents spreading fire across multiple targets or attempting two shots at the same target with reduced accuracy and power.

The key difference from Double Shot is that Rapid Shot allows targeting multiple enemies and uses separate attack rolls, while Double Shot is a single attack against one target with increased damage potential but a higher fumble risk.

For example, a semi-automatic pistol could perform Rapid Shot, allowing the character to fire at two different enemies or attempt two shots at the same target, while a bolt-action rifle could not, as it requires manual operation between each shot.

### Homebrew Wording

A character with a weapon capable of rapid multiple shots may choose to use Rapid Shot, making two separate attack rolls in a single round. These attacks can target the same opponent or different opponents. Each attack roll suffers a -3 penalty. If either attack hits, damage is rolled using 1D3 rather than 1D6. Any modifiers to the damage roll apply as normal to both damage rolls.
