# Stun

**Type:** Weapon Attack Option  
**Available to:** Energy weapons with stun capability (e.g., Phasers)

Some energy weapons can be set to a stun setting that renders targets unconscious without causing lethal damage. This setting is designed for non-lethal incapacitation.

## Effect

When using Stun mode:

- Damage is dealt as **temporary damage** (also called "stun damage")
- **Temporary damage does not kill** - even if a target drops below 0 or -4, they are rendered unconscious rather than killed
- For **Player Characters (PCs)**: If they drop below 0 or -4 from stun damage, they are rendered unconscious but will recover after a period of time (typically 1-4 hours, or as determined by the GM)
- For **NPCs**: They are rendered unconscious and will remain so until they recover naturally or are revived
- The target is **incapacitated** while unconscious from stun damage
- Stun damage is tracked separately from lethal damage, but both count toward the target's current health total

## Usage

Declare Stun mode before making your attack roll. The weapon must be set to stun mode (this may require a free action or interaction, depending on the weapon). Damage is calculated normally using the weapon's damage track, but all damage is treated as temporary/stun damage.

## Recovery

Characters rendered unconscious by stun damage will naturally recover consciousness after a period of rest (typically 1-4 hours, or as determined by the GM). Medical attention or specialized equipment may reduce recovery time.

## Limitations

- Only available to weapons with stun capability (typically energy weapons)
- Stun damage is temporary and does not cause permanent injury or death
- Some targets may have resistance or immunity to stun effects (robots, certain aliens, etc.)
