# Frenzied Attack

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

This option, seen as almost suicidal by many but favoured by berserkers, uses the presence of more enemies and opponents to drive an attacker on. The Hero must be facing more than one opponent in melee, and two or more must be actually targeting the Hero. The Hero, on a successful attack, does an additional +1 STAMINA damage to the target for every additional enemy. Thus a Hero fighting five orcs and using this option would inflict an additional +4 STAMINA damage on a successful attack. However, every additional enemy the Hero is facing will hit them automatically unless they roll a Fumble for their attack roll. Criticals will still be counted as normal. Thus the Hero fighting five orcs would make a combat roll against their target, and all of the other four Orcs would automatically hit, regardless of their combat total. As combat is resolved simultaneously, this could allow the Hero to take out an important enemy whilst also knowing they are likely to themselves be defeated.
