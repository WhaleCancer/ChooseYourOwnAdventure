# All Out Attack

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed ([Page 65](../../../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0065.png))

This option involves an undisciplined ferocious attack. Lacking in finesse and style, this attack will nevertheless do more damage if it does hit. For every -2 taken to the combat total, the damage inflicted is increased by +1 STAMINA.
