# Cautious Attack

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

This attack emphasises care over power. It will help the Hero if they are hit by adding +1 to an Armour roll they make this round. If they happen to win the round however, they will reduce their damage roll by -1. If a 1 is rolled for this damage roll, no damage at all is inflicted.
