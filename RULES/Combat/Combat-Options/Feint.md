# Feint

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed ([Page 65](../../../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0065.png))

This option attempts to fool an opponent into lowering his guard, to thus inflict more damage. It is a somewhat risky strategy, because if the opponent doesn't fall for the ploy, the Hero himself will leave a gap in his defence. If chosen, the Hero will gain +1 on his damage roll if he wins the round, but his opponent will also gain the same benefit if he wins.

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

In hand-to-hand or ranged combat, a fighter can try to confuse and deceive their enemy as to their intentions. If the Feinting character wins the combat, they gain a +1 to their damage roll. However, if the Feinting character loses that combat round, the damage roll against them gains a +1 bonus.
