# Spread Shot

**Type:** Weapon Attack Option  
**Available to:** Shotguns

Shotguns fire multiple pellets in a spread pattern. When you target someone with a shotgun, the spread pattern means you will also hit any characters adjacent to your target - you cannot avoid this, even if they are allies. This mirrors the multiple attack rules where attacking one target also hits adjacent characters.

## Effect

When using Spread Shot, the effect depends on whether your target has adjacent characters:

### If Target Has Adjacent Characters (Multi-Target Attack)
- You attack your primary target AND all characters adjacent to them
- Roll **separately** for your primary target and each adjacent character
- You must roll for all adjacent characters (enemies and allies alike) - this is automatic and unavoidable
- All targets must be within weapon range

### If Target Has No Adjacent Characters (Concentrated Shot)
- You target **one enemy** with a **+2 bonus** to your attack roll
- This represents concentrating the spread pattern on a single target when there are no adjacent characters to hit

## Usage

Declare Spread Shot before making your attack roll. Check if your target has any adjacent characters:
- **If yes**: You automatically use Multi-Target Attack and must roll for the primary target and all adjacent characters
- **If no**: You can use Concentrated Shot for the +2 bonus to hit

## Limitations

- Only available to shotguns
- Multi-Target Attack automatically hits all adjacent characters - you cannot choose to avoid allies
- Concentrated Shot only available if target has no adjacent characters
- All targets must be within weapon range
