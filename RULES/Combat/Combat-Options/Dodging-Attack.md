# Dodging Attack

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

This option allows the character to make a fluid attack, trying to keep out of the way of enemy weapons as much as possible. A bonus of +1, +2 or +3 may be chosen at the start of the combat round to apply to the dodge damage reduction roll. However, this bonus is limited by the Dodge special skill that Hero has. So a Hero with a Dodge special skill of 2 would be allowed to choose a +1 or +2 bonus. However, if the Hero wins the combat round their damage roll is penalised by the same amount as the bonus chosen. If the result is a 0 or less, no damage is inflicted by that attack.
