# Defensive Stance

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed ([Page 65](../../../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0065.png))

This option involves the Hero focusing purely on keeping out attacks, with little thought to hitting an opponent. The Hero gains a +2 bonus to his combat total against all opponents, even missiles, but will not inflict any damage, even if he wins that round.

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

A character may decide to spend a round avoiding damage rather than trying to inflict it. The defensive character gains a +2 bonus to their attack total for that round, but will not inflict any damage if they win. This option may be taken for both hand-to-hand and ranged combat, but if used for ranged combat the defensive character must still fire their weapon (and use ammo) which acts as suppressive fire.
