# Bipod Fire

**Type:** Weapon Support Option  
**Available to:** Machine guns and weapons with integrated bipods

Many machine guns feature integrated bipods that can be deployed to provide a stable firing platform. Firing from a bipod significantly improves accuracy and control, especially for sustained fire.

## Effect

- Gain a **+1 bonus** to your attack roll when firing from a deployed bipod
- Reduces recoil penalty for sustained fire
- You must be **prone or kneeling** to use a bipod
- You **cannot move** in the same round when using bipod fire

## Setup Time

- **Deploying the bipod** requires a **free interaction** (part of your movement or action) if you are already prone or kneeling
- If you need to **go prone or kneel** first, this costs your **movement action** for the round
- Once deployed, the bipod remains set up until you move or change position

## Usage

1. **Setup Phase:** Deploy the bipod (free interaction if already prone/kneeling, or use movement to go prone/kneeling)
2. **Fire Phase:** Declare Bipod Fire before making your attack roll
3. You must remain prone or kneeling and cannot move while using the bipod

## Limitations

- Requires the weapon to have an integrated bipod
- Must be prone or kneeling
- Cannot move while using bipod fire
- Bipod must be deployed (setup time required)
