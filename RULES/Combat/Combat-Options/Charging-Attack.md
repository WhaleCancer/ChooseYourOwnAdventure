# Charging Attack

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

This option may only be used if the Hero is able to rush to attack an enemy, and can reach them that same round. The charging Hero gains a bonus of +1 to their combat total on that round. If the charging Hero has a spear or polearm or similar, they gain an additional +1 to their combat total and a +1 to their damage roll if they win the combat round. However, if the enemy being charged also has a spear, they will also gain a +1 to the damage roll if they win the round. If the attacker is mounted, they gain +2 to the combat and damage rolls if they have a spear or lance. However, a target charged by a mounted hero has +2 to the damage roll if they win the round.
