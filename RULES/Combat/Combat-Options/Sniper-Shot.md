# Sniper Shot

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

If a character takes a full round to aim at a visible target and shoots at that target on the following round, they gain a bonus of +2 to their attack total. Further, if the attack hits, a penalty of -1 will be applied to the armour roll of the target. This option cannot be combined with Hyperfire, Rapid shot, etc.

## Combat Companion ([Page 27](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0027.png))

This option, useable by any Hero with a missile weapon, sees the Hero do nothing but aim for a full round, during which their target must be in plain view. On the following round, the attack can be made against that target with a +2 bonus to the attack roll and a -1 penalty to the armour roll. If the target moves out of sight, is killed or there is another reason why the attack cannot be completed, the benefits of aiming are lost.

## Sebastian's Notes

This option represents taking time to carefully aim at a target before firing. In our games, this is called **Aimed Shot** and represents the default condition when characters have weapons drawn and pointed at someone—they are aiming but not yet firing. Characters entering combat can distinguish between someone who is aiming and someone who is actually firing, though a character who is aiming can always choose to fire on the next round.

Unlike Long Shot, which is a quick snap shot at extended range with an attack penalty, Aimed Shot requires a full round of aiming but provides better accuracy and armor penetration.

### Homebrew Wording: Aimed Shot

A character with a ranged weapon may choose to spend a full round aiming at a visible target. During this round, the character does nothing but aim, and their target must remain in plain view. On the following round, the character may make an attack against that target with a +2 bonus to their attack roll and a -1 penalty to the target's Armor Roll. If the target moves out of sight, is killed, or there is another reason why the attack cannot be completed, the benefits of aiming are lost.

A character who is aiming can always choose to fire on the next round, but they may also continue aiming for additional rounds if they wish. Characters entering combat can distinguish between someone who is aiming and someone who is actually firing.
