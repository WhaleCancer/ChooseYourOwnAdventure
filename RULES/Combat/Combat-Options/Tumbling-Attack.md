# Tumbling Attack

## Combat Companion ([Page 27](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0027.png))

This option can only be used if the Hero is not in combat at the start of the round and the Hero is not wearing any armour. If chosen, the Hero will tumble, roll or enter combat acrobatically. It could be a roll along the ground or a great leap, but the effect will be the same. The Hero, if they win the round, will gain a bonus to the damage roll equal to the level of the Dodge special skill the Hero has. However, if the Hero loses the combat round, they cannot use their Dodge special skill to reduce the damage they take.
