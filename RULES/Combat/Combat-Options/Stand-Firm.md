# Stand Firm

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

This combat stance is especially useful if the Hero is fighting a bigger enemy on a bridge or in a doorway and is worried they will be pushed back. In a doorway this would allow the enemy through the defensive position and off a bridge could be disastrous. The Hero adopts a position of strength. This prevents an enemy pushing the Hero back, even if they use the Push Back option. However, they also have a -2 to any damage rolls they make if they win the combat round.
