# Bracing Required

**Type:** Weapon Limitation  
**Available to:** Machine guns and heavy automatic weapons

Machine guns and heavy automatic weapons generate significant recoil and are extremely difficult to control when fired from unsupported positions. These weapons require bracing against a solid surface to be used effectively.

## Effect

- The weapon **requires bracing** to be used effectively
- If fired **without bracing**, you suffer a **-2 penalty** to your attack roll
- Bracing reduces recoil penalty for sustained fire
- You can move while bracing, but must maintain contact with the bracing surface

## Usage

This is not a combat option you choose—it's a limitation of the weapon. You must brace the weapon against a solid surface (walls, vehicles, cover, barricades, etc.) when firing, or accept the -2 penalty for unsupported fire. The weapon must be in contact with a suitable bracing surface. Unlike bipod fire, bracing does not prevent movement as long as you maintain contact with the bracing surface.

## Limitations

- Requires a suitable bracing surface
- Unsupported fire suffers -2 penalty to attack rolls
- Must maintain contact with bracing surface to avoid penalty
