# Disarm

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

In hand-to-hand combat, a character may attempt to disarm their enemy of a hand-held weapon. Attack rolls must still be made, but the Disarming character will not inflict damage if they win, rather they will keep out of harm's way. However, once the combat is resolved (and whether the disarming character wins or loses), the disarming character must make a LUCK roll. If the character is lucky, their opponent is disarmed. If the character is unlucky, they themselves are disarmed! Like other uses of LUCK, an attempt to disarm costs 1 LUCK point.

## Combat Companion ([Page 25](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0025.png))

A Hero can attempt to disarm a weapon-using enemy with this option. If the Hero wins the combat round, they may Test for LUCK. On a success, the enemy has their weapon twisted out of their grasp. They must either spend two full rounds recovering it, or draw another weapon. If a Hero is a target of this option, they must themselves Test for LUCK. If they fail, they are disarmed. This option will never inflict damage.
