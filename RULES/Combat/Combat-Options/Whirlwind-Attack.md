# Whirlwind Attack

## Combat Companion ([Page 27](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0027.png))

This combat option is used when the Hero is surrounded by enemies, and is a gamble best used in times of desperation. The Hero makes a combat roll as normal, with the usual outnumbering penalty applying. However, the Hero is able to hit every enemy that has a lower combat total on that round. If the Hero hits an enemy, they roll a 1D3 for their damage roll rather than a 1D6 (normal bonuses to damage rolls apply). In addition, any enemy that has a higher combat total will have a +1 damage to the damage roll.
