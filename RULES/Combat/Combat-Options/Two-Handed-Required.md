# Two-Handed Required

**Type:** Weapon Limitation  
**Available to:** Heavy handguns and automatic weapons

Some weapons are too heavy, have too much recoil, or are too difficult to control to be effectively used with one hand.

## Effect

- The weapon **requires two hands** to use effectively
- If fired with only one hand, you suffer a **-1 penalty** to your attack roll
- The weapon's statistics list "Hands Required: 2" to indicate this limitation

## Usage

This is not a combat option you choose—it's a limitation of the weapon. You must use two hands when firing, or accept the -1 penalty for one-handed use. Some weapons may allow one-handed use with reduced accuracy as a "cinematic license" exception.
