# Long Shot

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

This option may be used to shoot at one further range category than the maximum listed for the weapon. Although this does not apply a modifier to the attack total, it does reduce the damage roll by -2 if the attack hits.

## Sebastian's Notes

This option is for scoped weapons that are capable of engaging targets at extended ranges. Unlike Sniper Shot, which requires a full round of aiming for increased accuracy and precision placement, Long Shot is a quick attempt to hit a target beyond normal range without the time investment. Long Shot can be used immediately but suffers a -2 penalty to the attack roll, while Sniper Shot requires a full round of aiming but provides +2 to attack and -1 to the target's Armor Roll.

**Note:** In the original rules, Long Shot reduces damage by -2. We have changed this to a -2 penalty to the attack roll instead to better differentiate it from Sniper Shot and make the two options work together more effectively.

The key difference is that Long Shot is a snap shot at extended range (-2 attack penalty), while Sniper Shot is a carefully aimed shot that takes time but provides better accuracy and armor penetration.

For example, a scoped hunting rifle or sniper rifle could perform a Long Shot, while a weapon without a scope would not be able to effectively engage targets at such extended ranges.

### Homebrew Wording

A character with a scoped weapon may choose to use Long Shot, attempting to hit a target at one range category further than the weapon's maximum listed range. This is a quick shot without the benefit of careful aiming. The attack roll suffers a -2 penalty. This option can be used immediately without requiring additional time to aim.
