# Assist

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

This option allows a character to help out another character with their action. The assisting character must take broadly the same action (shooting at the same target, swinging a weapon, etc.) and must use ammo if appropriate. The assisted character will gain a +2 bonus to their action, and they may make use of a separate combat option if preferred. The assisting character does not need to make a roll and their action has no direct result other than the assistance.

## Combat Companion ([Page 24](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0024.png))

In combat, a Hero can assist one of their allies, helping with their attack rather than making an attack of their own. Regardless of the ability of the assisting Hero, this adds +2 to the Combat total of the assisted Hero and +1 to the damage roll. The assisting character must have the capability to help with the attack (they must have a weapon for example) and they must be in a position that they could make an attack if they wanted to. So if armed with a sword they must be in combat with the target, if armed with a spear they must be behind the assisted character and if armed with a bow nearby. It is worth noting that if they are in the combat, they may themselves be a target of attacks and may need to make a "defensive" combat roll.
