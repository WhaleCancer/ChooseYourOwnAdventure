# Hyperfire

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

A character with an appropriate gun may choose to empty their magazine in a single round, increasing both the chance to hit and any damage done. The magazine must have at least half of its capacity remaining in order for this option to be used, and the intent must be declared at the start of the round. When used, the attacker gains a bonus of +2 to their attack total for that round and a +3 bonus to the damage roll if the attack hits. That magazine is now completely emptied and must be replaced before the weapon can be used again.

## Sebastian's Notes

Only fully automatic weapons can perform this action. Each fully automatic weapon can do a specific number of hyperfires (noted in the weapon's description) before the weapon is completely empty.

### Homebrew Wording

A character with a fully automatic weapon may choose to use Hyperfire, emptying a significant portion of their ammunition in a single round to increase both the chance to hit and any damage done. The weapon must have some ammunition remaining (as noted in the weapon's description for Hyperfire requirements), and the intent must be declared at the start of the round.

When used with sufficient ammunition, the attacker gains a bonus of +2 to their attack total for that round and a +3 bonus to the damage roll if the attack hits. If the weapon has less than the full amount needed for a Hyperfire, the bonuses to both attack total and damage are reduced by 1 (+1 to their attack total and +2 to the damage roll if the attack hits). If the weapon has less than half the amount needed for a Hyperfire, the attacker only gains a +1 bonus to the damage roll and no bonus to their attack total.

Each weapon has a limited number of Hyperfires it can perform before the ammunition supply is completely emptied and must be replaced before the weapon can be used again. The number of Hyperfires available is noted in each fully automatic weapon's description.
