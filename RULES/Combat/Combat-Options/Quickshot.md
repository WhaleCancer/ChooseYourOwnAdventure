# Quickshot

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

In most combats, all attacks in that round are resolved simultaneously, and even if a character is killed or immobilised by an attack, they may still be able to inflict damage themselves. If it is important to eliminate an enemy before they can inflict damage, a character may opt to attack earlier. The character may choose a penalty of -1 or more to be applied to their attack total, and will inflict damage before other attacks are resolved. If the target is killed or immobilised by this attack, the target cannot then act. If more than one combatant in a fight chooses this option, then attacks are resolved in order, with the highest penalty attack going first. In these circumstances, the Director may require all Quickshot-using character to secretly "bid" their penalty at the start of the round.
