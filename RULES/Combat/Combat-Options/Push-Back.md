# Push Back

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed ([Page 65](../../../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0065.png))

If this option is used against an opponent who is less than double the weight of the Hero, and the attack wins, the damage roll will automatically be a 1 (no need to roll) but the opponent will also be pushed back 2 metres. This can be particularly effective on bridges, the edge of cliffs etc.

## Stellar Adventures ([Page 31](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0031.png))

If this option is used, the main intent of the attack will be to drive the target back either physically or from the ferocity of the attack. It can be used for hand to hand or ranged attacks, and if the attack wins the round, the target is moved back an appropriate amount which will depend on the circumstances of the combat. The damage roll will be a 1 for that attack, although modifiers will still apply.
