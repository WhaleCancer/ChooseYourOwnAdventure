# Bypass Armour

## Combat Companion ([Page 24](../../../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/adapted/page_0024.png))

This option is effective against a heavily armoured enemy, whether worn or natural. It is difficult to get right, and puts the Hero at a disadvantage, but if it succeeds can prove decisive. The Hero has a -3 penalty to their combat total for this round. However, if the Hero wins the combat round, the loser does not get to make an Armour roll unless they have magical armour or shield. If the Hero has a magical weapon, even magical armour will be ignored. This option may not be used by a Hero without at least 1 point in the Dodge special skill.
