# Weapon Proficiency

Many weapons require the appropriate skill to be used effectively. Weapon descriptions will indicate the required skill and skill level needed. If a character's skill level is less than the required skill level, they suffer a penalty to attack rolls equal to the difference between their skill level and the required skill level. The character can still attempt to use the weapon despite insufficient skill.

> ## Examples
>
> A character with a Melee Weapons (Swords) skill level of 1 wielding a longsword (requiring 2) would suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls. A character with a Firearms-Light skill level of 1 attempting to use a sniper rifle (requiring 2) would suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls. An untrained character (requirement 2) using a heavy machine gun incurs a -2 penalty to attack rolls; using a minigun requiring skill 4 incurs a -4 penalty to attack rolls.
