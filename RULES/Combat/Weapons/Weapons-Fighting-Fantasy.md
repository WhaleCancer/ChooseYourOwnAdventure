# Weapons - Fighting Fantasy

## Weapon Damage Tables

**Source:** Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed, Page 60 [Page 0060](../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0060.png)

Each weapon has a damage track that converts the D6 damage roll into STAMINA damage. The damage track also has a '7+' column for modifiers. If for any reason the damage roll is below 1, the '1' column is used. The appropriate lines for any weapons possessed by a Hero should be copied onto the character sheet for easy reference. A Hero may receive bonuses to this roll from Talents, Spells or Priestly powers, which may increase the result to a 7 or more.

## Unarmed Combat

**Source:** Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed, Page 100 [Page 0100](../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0100.png)

Unarmed combat uses the same rules as armed combat, but a punch does a base 1 STAMINA POINT damage.

## Mounted Combat

**Source:** Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed, Page 60 [Page 0060](../../AFF_Advanced_Fighting_Fantasy_2nd_Ed_Pages/page_0060.png)

Special rules apply if a Hero or enemy is mounted during a fight. A mounted warrior needs the Mounted Combat special skill to fight effectively. Without it, the warrior suffers a -4 penalty to their attack total. In addition, the warrior's weapon special skill cannot be higher than their Mounted Combat special skill. The warrior will also need a ride Special Skill.

A mounted warrior gains a +1 bonus to their attack total, and some specially trained mounts can have their own attacks.

A mounted combatant charging gains a +2 bonus to the damage roll on the first round.

Various creatures can be used as mounts, including giant lizards, elephants, giant wolves, giant eagles and even Dragons!

### Master Weapons and Armour

**Source:** CB77021 - Combat Companion, Page 33 [Page 0033](../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/page_0033.png)

An alternative for a Hero with money but who has been unable to find magical equipment may well decide to invest in some equipment made by a master armourer or weaponsmith. Better than standard quality equipment but not as good as magical, this equipment can however be a great stopgap.

These items are 4x the standard cost, and can only be purchased from a master craftsman. Generally, these will only be found in cities and the largest towns, although Dwarven masters seem to be found in much smaller settlements also. It may also be necessary to specially commission these items from the craftsman, and so there may be a wait before they are ready. It is normally not possible to just buy a masterwork sword off the shelf!

A master weapon will increase the lowest value on the chart by one. That is to say that a masterwork sword will have the '1' result (normally 2 damage) increased to 3 damage and so a damage track that looks like:

| Roll | Normal | Master |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 |
| 5 | 3 | 3 |
| 6 | 4 | 4 |
| 7+ | 5 | 5 |

However, a Spear inflicts 2 STAMINA damage on a roll of 1 or 2. In this case, the '2' result would be increased, but the '1' result would not. The result would be:

| Roll | Normal | Master |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 3 |
| 5 | 3 | 3 |
| 6 | 4 | 4 |
| 7+ | 5 | 5 |

Master armour follows the same principle. However, any result of a 0 is not improved as the armour does not protect areas that armour type would not normally cover.

Thus a Breastplate, which does not protect at all on a roll of a 1, 2 or 3, will only have better protection on the 4 result.

A master leather hauberk, which protects for 1 STAMINA point of damage on results 2-6 will then have the following profile:

| Roll | Normal | Master |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 1 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | 2 |
| 7+ | 2 | 2 |

### Silver Weapons

**Source:** CB77021 - Combat Companion, Page 34 [Page 0034](../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/page_0034.png)

Although silver is not a great metal to make a weapon from, some smiths do indeed make daggers, spear heads, arrows and even swords from silver. Some undead and other creatures can only be harmed by silver or magic weapons and silver is far more easily available than magic.

Almost any weapon can be made of silver, although that is not to say that such weapons will be available easily. Countries plagued by undead may well have these weapons in every armoury though!

A silver weapon costs 10x the price of the normal version.

The weapon applies a -1 penalty to all combat rolls due to the increased weight and poor balance.

The weapon also has a -1 penalty to damage rolls due to the poor ability of silver to hold an edge.

Any combat roll of a double 1 breaks the weapon. It can be repaired by a smith or a Hero with a suitable special skill and appropriate facilities.

However, the weapon has no combat or damage penalty against any creature that can only be hit by silver or magic weapons. It will still break on a double 1 however.
