## Description

A hammer is a tool that consists of a heavy piece of metal or stone at the end of a handle. It is used, for example, to hit nails into a piece of wood or a wall.\n\nThis basic invention is effective as a weapon, while being a tool at the same time. Needs some muscles to work with, but lets you construct with more ease.
