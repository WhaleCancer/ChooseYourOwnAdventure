## Description

A refined mace, with a spiked head connected to the handle with a chain, engineered for efficient swinging and deadly impacts. The randomness of the chain movement means that damage may fluctuate greatly.

Based on medieval flails, weapons consisting of a handle connected to a spiked or flanged head by a chain. The chain allowed the head to swing with increased force and made the weapon difficult to block with shields or weapons. Flails were effective against armor because the swinging head could strike from unexpected angles and deliver concentrated impact force. However, the unpredictable nature of the chain movement made damage output variable and required skill to control effectively. Historical flails were primarily agricultural tools adapted for warfare, and their actual military use is debated, but they remain iconic medieval weapons.
