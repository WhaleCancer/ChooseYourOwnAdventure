## Description

A heavy mace consisting of a shaft and a heavy ball adorned with spikes. Very effective at piercing plate armor, this weapon is often used by more vicious knights and mercenaries.

Based on heavy maces and war hammers used by medieval knights and professional soldiers. The weighted head with spikes or flanges was specifically designed to defeat plate armor through concentrated impact force rather than cutting. Heavy maces required two hands to wield effectively and were devastating against heavily armored opponents. These weapons represented the specialized anti-armor melee weapons developed to counter increasingly sophisticated plate armor of the late medieval period.
