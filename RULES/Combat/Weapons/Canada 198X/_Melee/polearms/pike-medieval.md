## Description

A long, unwieldy polearm tipped with a sharp point for stabbing opponents. The reach of the pike allows to strike enemies much further away.

Based on pikes used in medieval and Renaissance warfare, particularly by Swiss and German infantry formations. The pike was an extremely long spear (typically 3-6 meters) designed to create impenetrable defensive formations. Pike formations were nearly invulnerable to cavalry charges and could dominate open battlefields. While unwieldy individually, massed pike formations became the dominant infantry tactic of the late medieval and early modern periods. The extended reach (approximately 2.8 meters) allowed pikemen to engage enemies at distance while maintaining defensive cohesion.
