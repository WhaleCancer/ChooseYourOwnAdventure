## Description

A long wooden pole adorned with a flag bearing the heraldry of its bearer. While it inspires unity and bolsters morale as a rallying point for soldiers, the standard itself is poorly suited for combat, offering little in terms of offense or defense.

Based on medieval battle standards and banners carried into battle to identify units and serve as rallying points. These standards featured the heraldic colors, symbols, and devices of the lord or unit they represented. While primarily ceremonial and tactical tools rather than weapons, standards could be used as improvised polearms in emergencies. The psychological impact of the standard was significant—its presence or loss could determine the outcome of battles, as soldiers would rally around their standard and could lose heart if it fell. Standard-bearers were elite soldiers chosen for their courage and loyalty, as they became prime targets for enemy forces seeking to demoralize their opponents.
