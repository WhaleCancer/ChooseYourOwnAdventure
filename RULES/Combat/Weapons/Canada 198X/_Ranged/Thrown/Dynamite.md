## Description

Commercial dynamite sticks used for mining, construction, and demolition. In 1985 British Columbia, dynamite is available to licensed individuals in mining, construction, or demolition industries, but can also be encountered in criminal hands through theft from legitimate sources or illegal acquisition.

Dynamite is more powerful than military hand grenades but less reliable when thrown. The sticks must be lit with a fuse before throwing, requiring preparation time. The fuse length determines the delay before detonation - too short and it may explode in the thrower's hand, too long and opponents may have time to move or extinguish it. Dynamite deals significant area of effect damage, capable of destroying structures and vehicles.

The most commonly encountered dynamite is commercial-grade, typically in stick form with fuses. Criminal use of dynamite indicates serious intent, as it requires knowledge of explosives handling and represents a significant threat. Cultists and other criminals may use dynamite for intimidation, destruction of evidence, or as improvised weapons.

Officers encountering thrown dynamite should be aware that it represents a serious explosive threat with greater destructive power than hand grenades, though it is less reliable and requires more preparation time. The presence of dynamite suggests either legitimate industrial activity or serious criminal intent.

## Combat Options

- **Fuse Timing:** The thrower must light the fuse before throwing. Roll 1d6: on a 1, the fuse is too short and explodes prematurely (damage to thrower); on a 6, the fuse is too long and opponents have time to react (+1 to SKILL for dodging)
- **Area Effect:** Dynamite deals damage to all targets within Short range of the impact point
- **Structural Damage:** Dynamite can destroy cover, damage vehicles, and breach structures
