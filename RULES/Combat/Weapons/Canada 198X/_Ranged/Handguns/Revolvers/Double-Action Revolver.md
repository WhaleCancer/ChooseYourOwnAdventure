## Description

An older pattern double-action revolver, typically dating from World War I or World War II. It's not as accurate as modern revolvers, but has decent firing speed and is quick on the draw. The older design sacrifices some accuracy and refinement compared to modern service revolvers, but the top-break action allows for faster reloading than swing-out cylinder revolvers.

The most commonly encountered examples are early 20th century military revolvers like the Webley Mk VI (1915) or Enfield No. 2 (1932). These weapons saw extensive service in both World Wars with Commonwealth forces, and many found their way into civilian hands as surplus or through veterans bringing them home. While officially obsolete for military service by 1985, these revolvers can still be found in private collections, surplus stores, or in the hands of veterans and collectors. Street-level gangs commonly use double-action revolvers, often acquiring them from surplus sources or through theft, as they represent affordable and accessible firearms for criminal activities. Officers encountering these weapons should be aware that they represent older technology and may have maintenance issues or be chambered in less common cartridges, but they remain functional firearms and should be treated with appropriate caution.
