## Description

A reliable handgun with good damage for its size. Single-handed weapon that's easy to carry and use. Good for close to medium range combat. These medium-frame double-action revolvers feature a reliable and straightforward design, making them well-suited for law enforcement service use and general-purpose handgun applications.

The standard issue service revolver for RCMP and most police forces in British Columbia is the Smith & Wesson Model 10 (introduced 1899), chambered in .38 Special. This reliable and proven design has served as the primary sidearm for RCMP officers throughout the province for decades. Some police departments issue the Colt Official Police (introduced 1927) as an alternative, though the Model 10 remains the most common. Officers are expected to maintain proficiency with their service revolvers, and these weapons are commonly encountered in the holsters of law enforcement officers throughout the province. The .38 Special cartridge provides adequate stopping power for law enforcement purposes, while the revolver's reliability and simplicity make it well-suited for duty use.

Older military surplus revolvers are also encountered, such as the Webley Mk VI (introduced 1915) or Enfield No. 2 (introduced 1932). These early 20th century military revolvers saw extensive service in both World Wars with Commonwealth forces, and many found their way into civilian hands as surplus or through veterans bringing them home. While officially obsolete for military service by 1985, these revolvers can still be found in private collections, surplus stores, or in the hands of veterans and collectors. Street-level gangs commonly use these older double-action revolvers, often acquiring them from surplus sources or through theft, as they represent affordable and accessible firearms for criminal activities. The older design sacrifices some accuracy and refinement compared to modern service revolvers, but the top-break action (on Webley models) allows for faster reloading than swing-out cylinder revolvers. Officers encountering these weapons should be aware that they represent older technology and may have maintenance issues or be chambered in less common cartridges, but they remain functional firearms and should be treated with appropriate caution.
