## Description

A reliable handgun with good damage for its size. Single-handed weapon that's easy to carry and use. Good for close to medium range combat. These medium-frame double-action revolvers feature a reliable and straightforward design, making them well-suited for law enforcement service use.

The standard issue service revolver for RCMP and most police forces in British Columbia is the Smith & Wesson Model 10 (1899), chambered in .38 Special. This reliable and proven design has served as the primary sidearm for RCMP officers throughout the province for decades. Some police departments issue the Colt Official Police (1927) as an alternative, though the Model 10 remains the most common. Officers are expected to maintain proficiency with their service revolvers, and these weapons are commonly encountered in the holsters of law enforcement officers throughout the province. The .38 Special cartridge provides adequate stopping power for law enforcement purposes, while the revolver's reliability and simplicity make it well-suited for duty use.
