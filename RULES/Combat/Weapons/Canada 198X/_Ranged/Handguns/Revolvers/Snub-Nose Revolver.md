## Description

A compact, snub-nosed revolver designed for easy concealment. Smaller and more concealable than standard [Service Revolver](Service Revolver.md)s, these revolvers sacrifice barrel length and some accuracy for portability and ease of concealment. The short barrel reduces effective range compared to full-size revolvers, but the compact design makes them ideal for backup weapons, plainclothes officers, and personal defense.

Based on compact snub-nose revolvers available in the 1980s, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 36 "Chief's Special" (introduced 1950) or Colt Detective Special (introduced 1927). These five-shot revolvers are chambered in .38 Special and feature shortened barrels (typically 2-3 inches) that make them easily concealable in pockets, ankle holsters, or under clothing. The Model 36 became popular with plainclothes officers, detectives, and civilians seeking a concealable sidearm. While the short barrel reduces accuracy and muzzle velocity compared to full-size service revolvers, the compact design makes them ideal for situations where concealment is more important than maximum range or accuracy. These weapons are commonly encountered as backup weapons, personal defense firearms, or as the primary sidearm for plainclothes law enforcement officers who need a weapon that can be easily hidden.
