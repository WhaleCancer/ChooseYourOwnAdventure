## Description

A spacer-tech gauss pistol. An array of coils accelerate sabot projectiles from a revolving drum, penetrating armor and piercing through targets in its path. It charges quicker than most coilguns at the cost of decreased damage.

Based on gauss/coilgun weapons seen in science fiction media, particularly video games like Fallout (gauss weapons), Mass Effect (coilguns), and various sci-fi films and literature. The electromagnetic coil acceleration system is a common sci-fi concept for advanced projectile weapons. The revolving drum mechanism and armor-piercing capabilities draw from depictions in games and films where gauss weapons are shown as high-tech alternatives to traditional firearms, often with visible electromagnetic effects and penetrating projectiles.
