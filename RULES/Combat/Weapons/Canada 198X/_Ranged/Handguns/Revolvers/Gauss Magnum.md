## Description

A spacer-tech gauss pistol. An array of electromagnetic coils accelerate sabot projectiles from a revolving drum, penetrating armor and piercing through targets in its path. It charges quicker than most coilguns at the cost of decreased damage. The compact pistol version provides portability, while the larger [Gauss Rifle](../../Rifles/Gauss Rifle.md) offers superior range, damage, and penetration for long-range engagements.

Based on gauss/coilgun weapons seen in science fiction media, particularly video games like Fallout (gauss weapons), Mass Effect (coilguns), and various sci-fi films and literature. The electromagnetic coil acceleration system is a common sci-fi concept for advanced projectile weapons. The revolving drum mechanism and armor-piercing capabilities draw from depictions in games and films where gauss weapons are shown as high-tech alternatives to traditional firearms, often with visible electromagnetic effects and penetrating projectiles.
