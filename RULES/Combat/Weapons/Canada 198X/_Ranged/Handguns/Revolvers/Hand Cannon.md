## Description

Slow firing revolver firing large caliber projectiles over long distances.

Based on the largest practical revolvers available in the 1980s, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 29 (1955) in .44 Magnum, Ruger Redhawk (1979) in .44 Magnum, Freedom Arms .454 Casull (1983), or large-frame .45 Colt revolvers. These massive handguns fire extremely powerful cartridges designed for maximum stopping power. The heavy recoil and slow recovery time between shots requires master-level skill to control effectively. The long barrel and powerful cartridge provide exceptional range for a handgun.
