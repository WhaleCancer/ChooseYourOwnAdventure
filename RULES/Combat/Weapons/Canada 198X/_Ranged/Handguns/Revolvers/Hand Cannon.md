## Description

A slow-firing revolver firing large caliber projectiles over long distances. These massive handguns fire extremely powerful cartridges designed for maximum stopping power. The heavy recoil and slow recovery time between shots requires master-level skill to control effectively.

Based on the largest practical revolvers available in the 1980s, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 29 (introduced 1955) in .44 Magnum, Ruger Redhawk (introduced 1979) in .44 Magnum, Freedom Arms .454 Casull (introduced 1983), or large-frame .45 Colt revolvers. The long barrel and powerful cartridge provide exceptional range for a handgun, making these weapons favored by hunters, specialized law enforcement units, and civilians who need maximum stopping power.
