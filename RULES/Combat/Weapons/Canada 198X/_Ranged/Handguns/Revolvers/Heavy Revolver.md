## Description

An ornate favorite among wealthy lawmen and bandits alike for its increased firepower and range at the cost of reload speed. These premium revolvers offer significantly increased stopping power and range compared to standard .38 Special service revolvers.

Based on large-frame .357 Magnum revolvers available in the 1980s, such as the Smith & Wesson Model 19 (introduced 1957) or Colt Python (introduced 1955). The .357 Magnum cartridge provides superior ballistics while remaining manageable, making these revolvers favored by some law enforcement officers and civilians who wanted more power than .38 Special but could still handle the recoil effectively. The heavier frame and more powerful ammunition require advanced skill to handle effectively, but are much more controllable than the larger magnum calibers.
