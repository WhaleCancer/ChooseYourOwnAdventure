## Description

An advanced automatic pistol with burst-fire capability, featuring a three-round burst selector. While it lacks the stopping power of larger handguns, it is exceptionally easy to draw and fire quickly, making it ideal for rapid response to sudden threats. The burst-fire mode sacrifices individual shot power but provides better hit probability through multiple projectiles.

The most commonly encountered automatic pistol with burst-fire capability is the Beretta 93R (1979), which features a three-round burst selector and a forward grip for improved control during burst fire. While the burst-fire mode sacrifices individual shot power, it provides better hit probability through multiple projectiles, making it effective for engaging threats at close range. These weapons are primarily encountered with quick-reaction forces, special operations units, and close-protection details. Officers encountering this weapon should be aware that it represents a significant escalation in firepower compared to standard semi-automatic pistols, and the burst-fire capability makes it particularly dangerous in close-quarters engagements.
