## Description

A compact semi-automatic pistol with a high rate of fire, capable of firing multiple shots quickly. While it doesn't hit as hard as a [Service Revolver](../Revolvers/Service Revolver.md), it makes up for it with rapid fire capability and compact size, making it effective for close-range combat. Smaller and more concealable than full-size [Combat Handgun](Combat Handgun.md)s, the autopistol prioritizes portability and concealability over maximum firepower and range. Shorter range than full-size pistols due to the compact barrel length, but more concealable and easier to use one-handed. Less powerful than [SMG](../SMGs/SMG.md)s but more concealable. The PPK variant is particularly concealable, benefiting from the Easy Concealment combat option.

**Walther PP** (introduced 1929) is a compact semi-automatic pistol with an 8-round magazine capacity. The PP features a slightly larger grip and frame compared to the PPK, providing better control and slightly higher capacity. While still compact, the PP is not quite small enough to benefit from the Easy Concealment combat option. The PP is used by some law enforcement agencies and civilians who need a compact sidearm with good capacity.

**Walther PPK** (introduced 1931) is the smaller, more concealable variant of the PP, featuring a 7-round magazine capacity. The PPK's reduced size makes it significantly more concealable than the PP, though at the cost of slightly lower capacity and a smaller grip. The PPK's ultra-compact design grants it the Easy Concealment combat option, making it favored by those who prioritize maximum concealability, such as undercover operatives or individuals who need to carry a weapon in very tight spaces.

Both pistols have developed a problematic reputation among certain groups. Cultists favor them because of the weapons' connection to Nazi Germany—it's well known that the Nazis dabbled in the occult, and some cults see these German pistols as having symbolic power. When encountering these weapons in the field, officers should be aware of these associations and the potential for encountering organized groups using them.
