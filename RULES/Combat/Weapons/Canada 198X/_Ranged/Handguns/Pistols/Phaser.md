## Description

A Starfleet-issue energy weapon from the 23rd century, capable of emitting a concentrated nadion particle beam with enough power to deal considerable damage. Phasers can be set to multiple power levels, from light stun to heavy stun to kill settings, making them versatile tools for both combat and non-lethal incapacitation.

**Phaser Type I** is an ultra-compact, concealable phaser that can be disguised as various everyday objects or hidden easily. While extremely portable and concealable, the Type I's compact design limits its effective range to very short distances. The Type I is favored by Starfleet personnel who need a weapon that can be carried without drawing attention, such as undercover operatives or officers in diplomatic situations.

**Phaser Type II** is the standard-issue hand phaser used by Starfleet personnel. Larger than the Type I, it offers better range and accuracy while remaining portable enough for standard duty use. The Type II's ergonomic design allows for improved two-handed aiming, making it more effective at standard combat ranges.

Both phaser types use the same nadion particle technology and deal identical damage, with the primary differences being size, concealability, and effective range. Phasers can be set to stun mode, which renders targets unconscious without causing lethal damage - a critical feature for Starfleet's mission of exploration and diplomacy. The stun setting is particularly useful when dealing with unknown life forms or situations where lethal force is not appropriate.

Less powerful than [SMG](../SMGs/SMG.md)s but more concealable (Type I) and easier to use one-handed. The larger [Phaser Rifle](../../Rifles/Phaser Rifle.md) offers superior range and damage for long-range engagements.
