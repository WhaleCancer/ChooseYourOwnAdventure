## Description

An advanced semi-automatic pistol with burst-fire capability, featuring a three-round burst selector. While it lacks the stopping power of larger handguns like the [Combat Handgun](Combat Handgun.md), it is exceptionally easy to draw and fire quickly, making it ideal for rapid response to sudden threats. The burst-fire mode sacrifices individual shot power but provides better hit probability through multiple projectiles.

The most commonly encountered burst-fire pistol is the Beretta 93R (introduced 1979), which features a three-round burst selector and a forward grip for improved control during burst fire. While the burst-fire mode sacrifices individual shot power, it provides better hit probability through multiple projectiles, making it effective for engaging threats at close range. These weapons are primarily encountered with quick-reaction forces, special operations units, and close-protection details. Officers encountering this weapon should be aware that it represents a significant escalation in firepower compared to standard semi-automatic pistols like the [Autopistol](Autopistol.md) or [Combat Handgun](Combat Handgun.md), and the burst-fire capability makes it particularly dangerous in close-quarters engagements.
