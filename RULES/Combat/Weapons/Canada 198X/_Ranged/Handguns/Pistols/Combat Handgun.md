## Description

A semi-automatic pistol designed for personal defense and combat use. The advanced counter-recoil system allows this weapon to be fired significantly faster than a standard autopistol, with ergonomic designs and refined recoil management systems that allow for rapid, accurate follow-up shots.

The most commonly encountered combat handgun is the Browning Hi-Power (1935), the standard service pistol for Canadian military forces, featuring a 13-round magazine and chambered in 9mm. Also encountered is the M1911 (1911), favored by some military units and security forces for its powerful .45 ACP cartridge. The M1911 is also commonly found with biker gangs, many of whom have American origins and maintain connections to U.S.-based organizations. These professional-grade semi-automatic pistols feature high capacity magazines and are typically used by military personnel, security forces, and federal agents. Officers encountering these weapons should be aware that they represent superior firepower compared to standard service revolvers, with higher capacity and faster follow-up shot capability.
