## Description

A close-range weapon that fires multiple pellets in a spread pattern. Effective at short range but loses effectiveness at longer distances. Can hit multiple targets in a cone. The manual pump action requires cycling the forend to chamber a new round, making it slower than semi-automatics but extremely reliable and versatile. More capacity and faster reload than [Double-Barrel Shotgun](Double-Barrel Shotgun.md)s, but less traditional. Less advanced than [Chain Shotgun](Chain Shotgun.md)s, but more reliable and easier to maintain. Better range than [Sawed-Off Shotgun](Sawed-Off Shotgun.md)s due to full-length barrels.

The most commonly encountered pump-action shotguns are the Remington 870 (introduced 1950), Mossberg 500 (introduced 1961), or Winchester Model 1300 (introduced 1978). These reliable pump-action shotguns are the most common type encountered in law enforcement, military, and civilian use. The Remington 870 in particular became the best-selling shotgun of all time due to its rugged construction and dependability. RCMP units use pump shotguns for tactical operations, finding them reliable and effective for close-quarters engagements. Biker gangs also commonly use pump shotguns, favoring them for their intimidating appearance, reliability, and devastating close-range firepower. Officers encountering pump shotguns should be aware that these weapons are highly effective at close range and can deliver devastating firepower in confined spaces, making them particularly dangerous in close-quarters combat situations.
