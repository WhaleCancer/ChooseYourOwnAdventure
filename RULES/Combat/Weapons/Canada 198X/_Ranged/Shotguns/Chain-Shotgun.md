## Description

An automatic shotgun that fires multiple pellets in rapid succession. Very effective at close range with high damage potential. Can hit multiple targets in a spread pattern. Consumes ammunition quickly.

Based on automatic and semi-automatic shotguns available in the 1980s, such as the Franchi SPAS-12 (1979), Pancor Jackhammer (prototype, 1984-1987), or Atchisson AA-12 automatic shotgun (prototype). The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) was a dual-mode shotgun capable of both semi-automatic and pump-action operation, designed for military and law enforcement use. The Pancor Jackhammer was an innovative select-fire automatic shotgun with a revolving cylinder magazine, featuring a distinctive bullpup design, though it never entered production. Automatic shotguns represent the pinnacle of close-quarters firepower, capable of delivering devastating firepower at close range but requiring advanced skill to control effectively due to recoil and ammunition consumption.
