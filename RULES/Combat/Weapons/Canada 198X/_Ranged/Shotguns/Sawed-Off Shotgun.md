## Combat Options

- **Double Shot:** Fire both barrels simultaneously in a single attack. Inflicts +2 damage if the attack hits, but this attack will Fumble on a roll of 2-4 rather than just a 2. Spread Shot rules still apply - if your target has adjacent characters, you also hit them. Requires both barrels to be loaded.
- **Spread Shot:** Attack two adjacent targets (roll separately) OR target one enemy with +2 to hit (cannot use if target has adjacent allies). See [Spread Shot](../../../Combat-Options/Spread-Shot.md) for details.

## Description

A sawed-off double-barrel shotgun, created by cutting down a standard [Double-Barrel Shotgun](Double-Barrel Shotgun.md) to reduce barrel length. The shortened barrels spread the shot pattern wider and drastically reduce effective range to very short distances, but the weapon retains the ability to fire both barrels individually in quick succession or simultaneously for devastating close-range firepower. More compact and concealable than standard shotguns like the [Pump Shotgun](Pump Shotgun.md) or [Chain Shotgun](Chain Shotgun.md), but much shorter range due to the cut-down barrels and harder to control due to increased recoil.

Based on sawed-off double-barrel shotguns, typically created by cutting down a standard double-barrel shotgun to reduce barrel length. Popularized in the American West and often associated with stagecoach guards, lawmen, and outlaws. In 1985 British Columbia, sawed-off shotguns are illegal modifications that are commonly encountered with criminals, biker gangs, and those seeking a compact, devastating close-range weapon. The shortened barrels spread the shot pattern wider at shorter ranges, making them devastating at close quarters but reducing effective range. The ability to fire both barrels simultaneously provides tremendous stopping power in close combat, though the increased recoil and reduced barrel length make them harder to control. Officers encountering sawed-off shotguns should exercise extreme caution, as these weapons are designed for maximum close-range firepower and are often used by criminals seeking an easily concealable but devastating weapon.
