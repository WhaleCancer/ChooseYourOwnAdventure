## Combat Options

- **Single Fire:** Semi-automatic capability allows for precise single shots. Spread Shot is always active - you must use Spread Shot rules when firing this weapon, even for single shots.
- **Hyperfire:** Automatic fire mode allows for sustained rapid-fire shots, devastating at close range. Spread Shot is always active - when using Hyperfire, you apply both effects: rapid automatic fire that also hits adjacent targets. See [Hyperfire](../../../Combat-Options/Hyperfire.md) and [Spread Shot](../../../Combat-Options/Spread-Shot.md) for details.
- **Suppressive Fire:** Can lay down a wide pattern of fire to suppress multiple targets
- **Spread Shot (Required):** This weapon always uses Spread Shot rules. Attack two adjacent targets (roll separately) OR target one enemy with +2 to hit (only if target has no adjacent characters). See [Spread Shot](../../../Combat-Options/Spread-Shot.md) for details.

## Description

An automatic shotgun that fires multiple pellets in rapid succession. Effective at short range with high damage potential. Can hit multiple targets in a spread pattern. Consumes ammunition quickly. Better range than [Sawed-Off Shotgun](Sawed-Off Shotgun.md)s due to full-length barrels.

Based on the Franchi SPAS-12 (introduced 1979), a select-fire shotgun capable of both semi-automatic and pump-action operation, designed for military and law enforcement use. The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) represents the pinnacle of close-quarters firepower, capable of delivering devastating automatic firepower at close range but requiring advanced skill to control effectively due to recoil and ammunition consumption. The SPAS-12's select-fire capability allows for either single-shot semi-automatic fire or full-automatic Hyperfire, but in either case, the weapon's spread pattern means Spread Shot rules always apply - you cannot avoid hitting adjacent characters when firing this weapon.
