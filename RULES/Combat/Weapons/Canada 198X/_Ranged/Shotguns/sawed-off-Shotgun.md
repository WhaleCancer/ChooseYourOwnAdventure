## Description

Short double-barreled shotgun. Whilst not having the same range as a standard shotgun, this weapon fires two barrels in quick successions.

### C198X

Based on sawed-off double-barrel shotguns, typically created by cutting down a standard double-barrel shotgun to reduce barrel length. Popularized in the American West and often associated with stagecoach guards, lawmen, and outlaws. The shortened barrels spread the shot pattern wider at shorter ranges, making them devastating at close quarters but reducing effective range. The ability to fire both barrels rapidly provides tremendous stopping power in close combat.
