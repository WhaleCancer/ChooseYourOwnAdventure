- **Double Shot:** Fire both barrels simultaneously in a single attack. Inflicts +2 damage if the attack hits, but this attack will Fumble on a roll of 2-4 rather than just a 2. Spread Shot rules still apply - if your target has adjacent characters, you also hit them. Requires both barrels to be loaded.
- **Spread Shot:** Attack two adjacent targets (roll separately) OR target one enemy with +2 to hit (cannot use if target has adjacent allies). See [Spread Shot](../../../Combat-Options/Spread-Shot.md) for details.

## Description

An older design of shotgun with two individually loaded barrels that emits a tight-packed spray of pellets. These break-action shotguns have two barrels that can be fired individually in quick succession or both barrels simultaneously for devastating close-range firepower. The simple, robust design has remained popular for over a century due to its reliability and ease of maintenance. The ability to fire both barrels at once provides tremendous stopping power, though it increases recoil and the risk of fumbling the shot. Better range than [Sawed-Off Shotgun](Sawed-Off Shotgun.md)s due to full-length barrels.

The most commonly encountered double-barrel shotguns are classic designs available in the 1980s, such as the Stevens 311 (introduced 1931) or various European side-by-side shotguns. Cultists commonly use double-barrel shotguns, seeming drawn to their traditional, ritualistic appearance and the symbolism of the double-barrel design. These weapons are also popular among rural hunters and collectors who appreciate the classic design and reliability. Officers encountering double-barrel shotguns should be aware that while they have limited capacity (typically only two rounds), they can be fired in rapid succession or both barrels simultaneously, and are highly effective at close range, making them dangerous despite their simple design.
