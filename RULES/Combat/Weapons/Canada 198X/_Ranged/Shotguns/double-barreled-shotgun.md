## Description

An older design of shotgun with two individually loaded barrels that emits a tight-packed spray of pellets. These break-action shotguns have two barrels that can be fired in quick succession, making them reliable for hunting or self-defense despite their limited capacity. The simple, robust design has remained popular for over a century due to its reliability and ease of maintenance.

The most commonly encountered double-barrel shotguns are classic designs available in the 1980s, such as the Stevens 311 (1931) or various European side-by-side shotguns. Cultists commonly use double-barrel shotguns, seeming drawn to their traditional, ritualistic appearance and the symbolism of the double-barrel design. These weapons are also popular among rural hunters and collectors who appreciate the classic design and reliability. Officers encountering double-barrel shotguns should be aware that while they have limited capacity (typically only two rounds), they can be fired in rapid succession and are highly effective at close range, making them dangerous despite their simple design.
