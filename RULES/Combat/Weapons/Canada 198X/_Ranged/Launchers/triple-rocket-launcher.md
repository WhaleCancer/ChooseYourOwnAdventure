## Description

A single-use rocket launcher that fires a cluster of three large-bore explosive rockets. Good against smalll groups of tough targets.\n\nBecause of its unwieldiness, single-use limitation, and the massive destruction it causes, it's said that one must be slightly crazy to use this weapon.
