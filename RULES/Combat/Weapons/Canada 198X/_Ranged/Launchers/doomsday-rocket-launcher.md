## Description

A single-use rocket launcher that fires a massive explosive projectile. Good against large groups of soft targets. Starts fires.\n\nBecause of its unwieldiness, single-use limitation, and the massive destruction it causes, it's said that one must be slightly crazy to use this weapon.
