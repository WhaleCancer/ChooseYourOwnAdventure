## Description

A versatile and rugged assault rifle widely used around the galaxy by militia forces and mercenaries.

Not as powerful as an assault rifle, but delivers 4 shot bursts.

Based on service rifles and burst-fire weapons available in the 1980s, such as the M16A2 (1982, with 3-round burst), or various militia-grade assault rifles. These weapons prioritize reliability and simplicity for use by less-trained personnel or irregular forces. The burst-fire mechanism reduces ammunition consumption compared to fully automatic fire while maintaining suppressive capability. Service rifles are designed for widespread issue to military and paramilitary organizations, emphasizing durability and ease of maintenance over cutting-edge technology.
