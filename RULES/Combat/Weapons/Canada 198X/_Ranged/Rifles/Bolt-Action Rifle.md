## Description

A precision rifle with high damage and long range. Slow rate of fire due to manual bolt action but very accurate. Good for medium to long range engagements. Requires two hands.

Based on bolt-action rifles available in the 1980s, such as the Remington 700 (1962), Winchester Model 70 (1936), or Mauser 98 (1898). Canadian military bolt-action rifles include the Ross Rifle (1903) used in World War I, and the Lee-Enfield No. 1 Mk III (SMLE, 1907) and Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I (1941) used in both World Wars. The Ross Rifle was Canada's first service rifle, highly accurate but problematic in trench warfare conditions, leading to its replacement with the reliable Lee-Enfield. The Lee-Enfield No. 4 became the standard Canadian service rifle during World War II, known for its reliability and effectiveness. These precision rifles use manual bolt-action operation, requiring the shooter to manually cycle the bolt after each shot. While slower than semi-automatic rifles, bolt-action designs offer superior accuracy potential due to the rigid action and the ability to accommodate high-powered cartridges. The Remington 700 became one of the most popular and accurate bolt-action rifles, widely used for hunting and by police/military snipers. The Mauser 98 action remains one of the most reliable and copied designs in history.

Scoped hunting rifles are common civilian variants, featuring telescopic sights and optimized for precision shooting at game animals. These rifles are designed for single-shot accuracy rather than rapid fire, with the long range and low fire rate making them ideal for hunters who need to make clean, ethical kills without alarming nearby game. While primarily civilian hunting tools, these same rifles often serve double duty as precision marksman weapons, with many military and police snipers using commercial hunting rifle platforms as their base. The Remington 700 and Winchester Model 70 are particularly popular choices for both hunting and precision shooting applications.
