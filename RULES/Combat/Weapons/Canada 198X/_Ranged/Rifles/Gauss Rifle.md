## Description

A spacer-tech gauss rifle. A set of coils accelerate ferromagnetic sabots up to breakneck speeds, penetrating armor and piercing through multiple targets alike. These weapons are popular among frontline infantry fighting in mechanoid wars.

This futuristic weapon draws inspiration from the Gauss Rifle featured in Fallout 2 (1998), a powerful magnetic accelerator rifle that uses electromagnetic coils to launch ferromagnetic projectiles at extreme velocities. The electromagnetic acceleration technology represents a futuristic evolution of projectile weapons, using magnetic fields to launch projectiles at velocities far exceeding traditional firearms, providing exceptional penetration and range.
