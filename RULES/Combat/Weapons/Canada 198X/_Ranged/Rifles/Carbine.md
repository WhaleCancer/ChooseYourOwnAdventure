## Description

A compact, shortened rifle designed for close-quarters combat and improved maneuverability. While accurate at close range, the shorter barrel and stock reduce effectiveness at longer ranges compared to full-length [Assault Rifle](Assault Rifle.md)s.

The C8 carbine is the Canadian carbine variant of the C7, featuring a shorter barrel and collapsible stock for improved portability. The C8 provides the same firepower as the C7 in a more compact package, making it ideal for vehicle crews, special forces, and urban combat specialists. Also encountered are the CAR-15/XM177 (introduced in the 1960s), compact variants of the M16 designed for special operations, and the M1 Carbine (adopted by the U.S. military in 1941), a lightweight semi-automatic carbine that saw extensive service through World War II and the Korean War. Carbines feature shorter barrels and often bullpup configurations, trading long-range accuracy for improved maneuverability in close-quarters combat. The bullpup design places the action behind the trigger, allowing for a full-length barrel in a compact package. These weapons are favored by personnel who need the firepower of a rifle in a more portable package, balancing effectiveness with portability for specialized roles.
