## Description

A rifle that uses a lever located around the trigger guard area to load fresh cartridges from a tubular magazine. While not as powerful as other rifles like [Bolt-Action Rifle](Bolt-Action Rifle.md)s, lever-action rifles allow for rapid reload and faster follow-up shots. Used widely in North America for the ability to be shot single-handedly from horseback, making them popular with frontiersmen, cowboys, and hunters.

Based on lever-action rifles of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Winchester Model 1873 (introduced 1873), Winchester Model 1894 (introduced 1894), or Marlin Model 336 (introduced 1948). These rifles feature a lever mechanism that cycles cartridges from a tubular magazine, allowing for faster follow-up shots than single-shot rifles while maintaining reliability. Lever-action rifles were popular with frontiersmen, cowboys, and hunters for their rapid fire capability and distinctive western aesthetic. While largely superseded by bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles by the 1980s, lever-actions remained popular among enthusiasts, hunters, and in rural areas of British Columbia where their classic design and reliability were valued. The Winchester Model 1894 in particular became one of the most popular lever-action rifles, with millions produced and remaining in use well into the 1980s.
