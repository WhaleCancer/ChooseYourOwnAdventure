## Description

A rifle that uses a lever located around the trigger guard area to load fresh cartridges. Whilst not as powerful as other rifles, this gun allows for rapid reload.

Used widely around the western worlds for the ability to be shot single-handedly on the horseback.

Based on lever-action rifles of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the Winchester Model 1873 (1873), Winchester Model 1894 (1894), or Marlin Model 336 (1948). These rifles feature a lever mechanism that cycles cartridges from a tubular magazine, allowing for faster follow-up shots than single-shot rifles while maintaining reliability. Lever-action rifles were popular with frontiersmen, cowboys, and hunters for their rapid fire capability and distinctive western aesthetic. While largely superseded by bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles by the 1980s, lever-actions remained popular among enthusiasts, hunters, and in rural areas where their classic design and reliability were valued.
