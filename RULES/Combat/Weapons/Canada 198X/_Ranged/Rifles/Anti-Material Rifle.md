## Description

A heavy-caliber rifle designed to engage vehicles, equipment, and hardened targets at long ranges. Significantly larger and heavier than standard [Bolt-Action Rifle](Bolt-Action Rifle.md)s or sniper rifles, these weapons require bipods or rests for stability due to the massive recoil of their heavy-caliber cartridges.

Based on anti-material rifles such as the Barrett M82 (adopted by the U.S. military in 1982) or McMillan TAC-50 (introduced 1980). These rifles fire heavy-caliber cartridges (.50 BMG, 12.7×99mm NATO) designed to engage vehicles, equipment, and hardened targets at long ranges. Anti-material rifles are significantly larger and heavier than standard sniper rifles, requiring bipods or rests for stability due to the massive recoil. The Barrett M82 became the first widely adopted .50 caliber sniper rifle, revolutionizing long-range precision fire and anti-material capabilities. These weapons are effective against light vehicles, aircraft, communications equipment, and other material targets, though they can also be devastating against personnel.
