## Description

Being a .50 caliber rifle, this weapon was designed to fight enemy armored equipment.

Used widely around the rim in mechanoid warzones, this weapon is also useful against infantry, allowing for a 1-hit kill.

Based on anti-material rifles available in the 1980s, such as the Barrett M82 (1982) or McMillan TAC-50 (1980). These rifles fire heavy-caliber cartridges (.50 BMG, 12.7×99mm NATO) designed to engage vehicles, equipment, and hardened targets at long ranges. Anti-material rifles are significantly larger and heavier than standard sniper rifles, requiring bipods or rests for stability due to the massive recoil. The Barrett M82 became the first widely adopted .50 caliber sniper rifle, revolutionizing long-range precision fire and anti-material capabilities. These weapons are effective against light vehicles, aircraft, communications equipment, and other material targets, though they can also be devastating against personnel.
