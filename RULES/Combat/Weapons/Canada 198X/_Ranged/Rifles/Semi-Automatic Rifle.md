## Description

A civilian semi-automatic rifle designed primarily for hunting and sport shooting. While not as accurate as precision [Bolt-Action Rifle](Bolt-Action Rifle.md)s, semi-automatic rifles provide faster target engagement and better performance against multiple threats. These rifles offer the power of full-power cartridges with the rapid follow-up capability of semi-automatic operation, making them popular among hunters who need quick follow-up shots.

Based on civilian semi-automatic rifles available in the 1980s, such as the Remington 742 (introduced 1955), Remington 7400, or Winchester Model 100. These rifles are designed for hunting applications, chambered in common hunting cartridges like .30-06 Springfield, .308 Winchester, or .270 Winchester. While not as accurate as precision bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles provide faster target engagement and better performance against multiple threats, making them popular among hunters who need quick follow-up shots on game.
