## Description

Semi-automatic model of a standard bolt action rifle. Whilst not as accurate and powerful as the predecessor, it makes up with fast firing speed.

Based on semi-automatic rifles available in the 1980s, such as the M1 Garand (1936), M1A (civilian M14 variant, 1974), or Remington 742 (1955). These rifles offer the accuracy and power of full-power cartridges with the rapid follow-up capability of semi-automatic operation. While not as accurate as precision bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles provide faster target engagement and better performance against multiple threats. The M1 Garand in particular revolutionized infantry combat with its en-bloc clip system and reliable semi-automatic action, remaining in service with some forces into the 1980s.
