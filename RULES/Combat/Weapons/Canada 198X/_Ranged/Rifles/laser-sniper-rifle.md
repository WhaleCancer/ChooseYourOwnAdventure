## Description

An ultratech sniper rifle capable of emitting a concentrated beam of light with enough power to deal considerable damage over long range.

By using advanced battery cells, this weapon is capable of warming up, boosting the firing speed with each consecutive shot when standing still.

This weapon can overheat when fully warmed up, resulting in a small battery explosion around the user.

This futuristic weapon draws inspiration from science fiction media, including laser sniper rifles from movies, television shows, and video games featuring advanced energy weaponry. The laser technology represents the ultimate evolution of precision long-range weapons, providing devastating energy-based firepower with the accuracy and range of advanced sniper systems.
