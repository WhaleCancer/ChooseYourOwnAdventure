## Description

An automatic rifle designed for sustained automatic fire, heavier than standard [Assault Rifle](Assault Rifle.md)s but more portable than [Light Machine Gun](../Machinge Guns/LMG.md)s. These weapons bridge the gap between individual rifles and dedicated machine guns, providing automatic fire capability in a rifle-sized package.

The C2A1 (adopted by the Canadian Armed Forces in 1955) is the automatic rifle variant of the [Battle Rifle](Battle Rifle.md) C1A1, chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. Manufactured by Canadian Arsenals Limited, the C2A1 provided Canadian squads with portable automatic fire capability, designed to be fired from the shoulder while advancing or from a bipod for sustained fire. Though being phased out in favor of the C7, the C2A1 remains in service and is commonly encountered among Canadian military personnel. The C2A1 served as the standard automatic rifle from 1955 to 1984, when it began being replaced by the C7. Also encountered is the Browning Automatic Rifle or BAR (adopted by the U.S. military in 1918), introduced during World War I and serving extensively through World War II and the Korean War. Chambered in .30-06 Springfield, the BAR provided squads with portable automatic fire capability, designed to be fired from the shoulder while advancing or from a bipod for sustained fire. Though obsolete for military service, examples may still be encountered in surplus stores, collections, or in the hands of veterans and collectors. Some may have found their way into civilian hands through surplus sales or as war trophies. The presence of a BAR would indicate older military equipment or historical significance, though some examples may still be functional and dangerous despite their age.
