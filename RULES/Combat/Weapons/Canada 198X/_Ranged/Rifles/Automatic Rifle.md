## Description

An automatic rifle designed for sustained automatic fire, heavier than standard assault rifles but more portable than light machine guns. These weapons bridge the gap between individual rifles and dedicated machine guns, providing automatic fire capability in a rifle-sized package.

The most commonly encountered automatic rifle is the Browning Automatic Rifle or BAR (1918), introduced during World War I and serving extensively through World War II. Chambered in .30-06 Springfield, the BAR provided squads with portable automatic fire capability, designed to be fired from the shoulder while advancing or from a bipod for sustained fire. Though obsolete for military service by 1985, examples may still be encountered in surplus stores, collections, or in the hands of veterans and collectors. Some may have found their way into civilian hands through surplus sales or as war trophies. Officers encountering automatic rifles should be aware that while these weapons are from an earlier era, they remain fully automatic and can deliver significant sustained firepower, making them dangerous despite their age. The presence of a BAR would indicate older military equipment or historical significance, though some examples may still be functional and dangerous.
