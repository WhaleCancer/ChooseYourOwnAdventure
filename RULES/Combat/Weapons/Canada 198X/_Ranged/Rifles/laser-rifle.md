## Description

An ultratech rifle capable of emitting a concentrated beam of light with enough power to deal considerable damage over medium distance.

By using advanced battery cells, this weapon is capable of warming up, boosting the firing speed with each consecutive shot when standing still.

This weapon can overheat when fully warmed up, resulting in a small battery explosion around the user.

This futuristic weapon draws inspiration from science fiction media, including laser rifles from movies, television shows, and video games featuring advanced energy weaponry. The laser technology represents a futuristic evolution of rifle technology, providing precision energy-based firepower with the reliability and range of advanced military weapons.
