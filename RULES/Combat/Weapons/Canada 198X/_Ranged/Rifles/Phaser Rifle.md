## Description

A Starfleet-issue energy rifle from the 23rd century, capable of emitting a concentrated nadion particle beam with enough power to deal considerable damage over long distances. The phaser rifle offers superior range and damage compared to the compact [Phaser](../../Handguns/Pistols/Phaser.md) hand phasers, making it ideal for long-range engagements and extended combat situations.

Phaser rifles can be set to multiple power levels, from light stun to heavy stun to kill settings, making them versatile tools for both combat and non-lethal incapacitation. The stun setting is particularly useful when dealing with unknown life forms or situations where lethal force is not appropriate, allowing Starfleet personnel to neutralize threats without causing permanent harm.
