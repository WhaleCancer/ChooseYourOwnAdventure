## Description

A designated marksman rifle.

Whilst it shares similarities with a standard bolt-action rifle, it trades off its damage for firing two shots in quick succession.

Based on designated marksman rifles such as the SVD Dragunov (1963), M21 (M14-based, 1969), or semi-automatic precision rifles. These rifles fill the gap between standard assault rifles and dedicated sniper rifles, providing enhanced accuracy and range while maintaining semi-automatic fire capability. The SVD Dragunov was specifically designed as a purpose-built DMR for Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces, chambered in 7.62×54mmR and featuring the distinctive PSO-1 telescopic sight. Designated marksman rifles allow a squad to engage targets at longer ranges than standard infantry weapons, with the designated marksman serving as the squad's precision shooter. The M21, based on the M14 but with improved optics and match-grade ammunition, became the standard DMR for U.S. forces, offering the precision of a sniper rifle with faster follow-up shots.
