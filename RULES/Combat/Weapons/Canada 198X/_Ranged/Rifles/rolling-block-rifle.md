## Description

An ornate high-power marksmen rifle originally designed for dispatching muffalo in a single shot. Once outfitted with a long-range scope and modernized reloading system it didn't take long for would-be bounty hunters to embrace the hunting instrument.

Tales of steamworld gunslingers would imply this weapon and ones like it are capable of occasional incredibly lucky shots.

Based on single-shot rolling block rifles of the late 19th century, such as the Remington Rolling Block (1867) or Sharps rifle (1848). These rifles feature a distinctive rolling block breech mechanism that seals the chamber and provides excellent strength for high-powered cartridges. Rolling block rifles were renowned for their accuracy and power, popular with buffalo hunters, long-range target shooters, and military forces worldwide. While single-shot designs were obsolete by the 1980s, rolling block rifles remained valued as collectibles and could still be found in use by hunters who appreciated their accuracy and classic design. The robust mechanism allowed these rifles to handle powerful cartridges that could take down large game with a single well-placed shot.
