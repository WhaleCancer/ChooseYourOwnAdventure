### C198X

A standard-issue automatic rifle with good balance between range, power, and accuracy. Effective at medium to long ranges with high rate of fire. The most common example in this setting is the C7 (1984), the standard service rifle for the Canadian Armed Forces. A Canadian adaptation of the M16A1E1, chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO with a heavy barrel and improved sights. In 1985 British Columbia, the C7 is newly issued and increasingly common among Canadian military personnel as it replaces the older C1A1. Also encountered are the M16A1 (1964), standard service rifle for U.S. and many allied forces, and the AK-47/AKM (1959), the most widely produced assault rifle in the world. These select-fire rifles fire intermediate-power cartridges, allowing for both semi-automatic precision fire and automatic suppressive fire, balancing firepower, accuracy, and portability as the primary infantry weapon for modern military forces.
