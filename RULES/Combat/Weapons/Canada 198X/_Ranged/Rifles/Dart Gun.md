## Description

A non-lethal air gun used to reduce irritability or agitation in animals or humans via anesthetic drugs commonly referred to as tranquilizers. These weapons use compressed air or gas to fire darts loaded with sedative or anesthetic compounds, delivering the drug through a needle upon impact.

Based on tranquilizer dart guns and air-powered dart rifles used by veterinarians, wildlife researchers, and law enforcement for safely sedating animals or subduing suspects. Dart guns are designed for non-lethal incapacitation, with the effectiveness depending on proper dosage calculation based on the target's size and weight. While primarily used for animal handling in veterinary and wildlife management contexts, specialized dart systems have been developed for human applications in law enforcement and medical contexts. In 1985 British Columbia, dart guns may be encountered with veterinarians, wildlife management officers, researchers, or specialized law enforcement units requiring non-lethal incapacitation capabilities.
