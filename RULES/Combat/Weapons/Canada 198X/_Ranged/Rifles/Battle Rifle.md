## Description

A semi-automatic or select-fire rifle commonly used by special forces and military units due to its range and accuracy.

Slightly longer range and higher damage than an Assault Rifle, with select-fire capability allowing semi-automatic fire or fully automatic fire (though automatic fire is less controllable due to the powerful cartridge).

Based on battle rifles available in the 1980s, such as the M14 (adopted 1957), FN FAL (production began 1953), or G3 (adopted 1959). These rifles fire full-power cartridges (7.62×51mm NATO), providing superior range and penetration compared to intermediate-caliber assault rifles, at the cost of increased recoil and weight. Battle rifles bridge the gap between assault rifles and sniper rifles, offering the precision and power for designated marksman roles while maintaining semi-automatic or select-fire capability. The M14 and FN FAL saw extensive service with military forces worldwide, valued for their reliability and effectiveness at longer ranges.

### Description

A designated marksman rifle is essentially a battle rifle with an integrated telescopic sight, providing enhanced accuracy and range. The scope allows for precise engagement at longer distances while maintaining the semi-automatic fire capability of the base battle rifle, making it more versatile in combat situations than dedicated sniper rifles.

Based on designated marksman rifles such as the SVD Dragunov (1963), M21 (M14-based, 1969), or semi-automatic precision rifles. These rifles fill the gap between standard assault rifles and dedicated sniper rifles, providing enhanced accuracy and range while maintaining semi-automatic fire capability. The SVD Dragunov was specifically designed as a purpose-built DMR for Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces, chambered in 7.62×54mmR and featuring the distinctive PSO-1 telescopic sight. Designated marksman rifles allow a squad to engage targets at longer ranges than standard infantry weapons, with the designated marksman serving as the squad's precision shooter. The M21, based on the M14 but with improved optics and match-grade ammunition, became the standard DMR for U.S. forces, offering the precision of a sniper rifle with faster follow-up shots.
