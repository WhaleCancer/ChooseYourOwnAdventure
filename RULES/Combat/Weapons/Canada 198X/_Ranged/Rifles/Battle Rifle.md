## Description

A semi-automatic rifle commonly used by special forces due to its range and accuracy.

Slightly longer range and higher damage than an Assault Rifle, but only fires two round bursts.

Based on battle rifles available in the 1980s, such as the M14 (1959), FN FAL (1953), or G3 (1959). These rifles fire full-power cartridges (7.62×51mm NATO), providing superior range and penetration compared to intermediate-caliber assault rifles, at the cost of increased recoil and weight. Battle rifles bridge the gap between assault rifles and sniper rifles, offering the precision and power for designated marksman roles while maintaining semi-automatic or select-fire capability. The M14 and FN FAL saw extensive service with military forces worldwide, valued for their reliability and effectiveness at longer ranges.
