## Description

A semi-automatic or select-fire rifle commonly used by special forces and military units due to its range and accuracy.

Slightly longer range and higher damage than an [Assault Rifle](Assault Rifle.md), with select-fire capability allowing semi-automatic fire or fully automatic fire (though automatic fire is less controllable due to the powerful cartridge). Compared to [Bolt-Action Rifle](Bolt-Action Rifle.md)s, battle rifles offer faster follow-up shots and higher rate of fire, but typically have lower maximum accuracy potential due to their semi-automatic action.

Based on battle rifles available in the 1980s, such as the M14 (adopted by the U.S. military in 1957), FN FAL (production began 1953, adopted by Belgium and many NATO countries) including the Canadian C1A1 variant, or G3 (adopted by West Germany in 1959). These rifles fire full-power cartridges (7.62×51mm NATO), providing superior range and penetration compared to intermediate-caliber assault rifles, at the cost of increased recoil and weight. Battle rifles bridge the gap between assault rifles and sniper rifles, offering the precision and power for designated marksman roles while maintaining semi-automatic or select-fire capability. The M14 and FN FAL saw extensive service with military forces worldwide, valued for their reliability and effectiveness at longer ranges. The Canadian C1A1, adopted by the Canadian Armed Forces in 1955 and manufactured by Canadian Arsenals Limited, was the standard service rifle from 1955 to 1984.
