## Description

An assault rifle with a bullpup configuration, featuring the magazine behind the trigger. It has good range, decent power, and good accuracy. Due to lightweight plasteel material, it's also quick to draw and fire.

Based on bullpup assault rifles available in the 1980s, such as the Steyr AUG (1977), FAMAS (1978), or L85 (1985). The bullpup design places the action and magazine behind the trigger, allowing for a full-length barrel in a more compact package. This configuration reduces overall weapon length while maintaining ballistic performance. The quickdraw capability comes from advanced plasteel alloys that allow for instant target acquisition and firing. The Steyr AUG became one of the most successful bullpup rifles, adopted by multiple nations, while the FAMAS served as France's standard service rifle. The L85, despite initial reliability issues, became the standard British service rifle. These weapons excel in urban combat and confined spaces where the shorter length provides a significant advantage.
