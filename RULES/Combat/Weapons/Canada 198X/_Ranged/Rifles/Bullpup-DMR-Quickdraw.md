## Description

A bullpup designated marksman rifle. While it shares similarities with a standard bolt-action rifle, it trades off some damage for firing two shots in quick succession. Due to lightweight plasteel material, it is quick to draw and fire.

Based on bullpup designated marksman rifles and precision rifles. While bullpup DMRs were less common in the 1980s, the concept represents an evolution of bullpup rifle technology applied to precision shooting. The bullpup configuration allows for a full-length barrel in a more compact package, while the quickdraw capability comes from advanced plasteel alloys that allow for instant target acquisition and firing. This weapon bridges the gap between standard assault rifles and dedicated sniper rifles, providing enhanced accuracy and range while maintaining rapid follow-up shot capability. The two-shot capability allows the marksman to engage targets more quickly than a bolt-action rifle, while the compact bullpup design makes it easier to carry and deploy in the field.
