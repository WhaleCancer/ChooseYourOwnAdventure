## Description

A precision long-range weapon with high damage but slow rate of fire. Excellent accuracy at extreme ranges, making it ideal for taking out targets from a distance. Requires advanced training and skill (Skill Level 3) compared to standard [Bolt-Action Rifle](Bolt-Action Rifle.md)s (Skill Level 1), as sniper rifles are specialized military and law enforcement precision weapons optimized for extreme accuracy.

Based on sniper rifles available in the 1980s, such as the C3 (Canadian designation for the Parker-Hale M82, used by the Canadian Armed Forces), M40 (adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps in 1966, Remington 700-based), or various precision bolt-action rifles used by military and law enforcement snipers. These rifles are optimized for extreme accuracy at long ranges, featuring heavy free-floating barrels, precision optics, adjustable triggers, and match-grade ammunition. Sniper rifles require extensive training and skill to use effectively, with the shooter needing to account for distance, wind, bullet drop, and target movement. The C3 represents the professional sniper capability available to Canadian forces, based on the Parker-Hale M82 and chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. The M40 series became the standard sniper rifle for U.S. Marine Corps, built on the Remington 700 action and chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO for maximum precision. These weapons are encountered primarily with Canadian military personnel, RCMP tactical units, or specialized law enforcement teams on operations or training exercises.
