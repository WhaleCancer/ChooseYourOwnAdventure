## Description

A precision long-range weapon with high damage but slow rate of fire. Excellent accuracy at extreme ranges, making it ideal for taking out targets from a distance.

Based on sniper rifles available in the 1980s, such as the M40 (Remington 700-based, 1966), Winchester Model 70 (1936), or various precision bolt-action rifles used by military and law enforcement snipers. These rifles are optimized for extreme accuracy at long ranges, featuring heavy barrels, precision optics, and match-grade ammunition. Sniper rifles require extensive training and skill to use effectively, with the shooter needing to account for distance, wind, bullet drop, and target movement. The M40 series became the standard sniper rifle for U.S. Marine Corps, built on the Remington 700 action and chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO for maximum precision.
