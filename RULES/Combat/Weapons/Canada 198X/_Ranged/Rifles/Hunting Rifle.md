## Description

An ancient pattern bolt-action rifle with a scope. With its exceptional range, and low fire rate, it is unlikely to drive animals to revenge, which makes it an excellent choice for hunting.

Based on hunting rifles available in the 1980s, such as the Remington 700 (1962), Winchester Model 70 (1936), or various commercial bolt-action rifles. These rifles are designed for precision shooting at game animals, featuring scoped sights and optimized for single-shot accuracy rather than rapid fire. The long range and low fire rate make them ideal for hunters who need to make clean, ethical kills without alarming nearby game. While primarily civilian hunting tools, these same rifles often serve double duty as precision marksman weapons, with many military and police snipers using commercial hunting rifle platforms as their base.
