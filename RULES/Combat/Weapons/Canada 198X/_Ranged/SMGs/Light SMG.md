## Description

An open bolt lightweight submachine gun with improved cooling, allowing for longer bursts before the weapon needs to be cooled. Features a compact design with an overhanging bolt and telescoping bolt design that allows the weapon to be shorter while maintaining barrel length. The open-bolt design provides natural cooling, allowing for longer bursts before the weapon needs to cool down, while the compact frame makes it highly portable while still delivering effective firepower. These weapons feature select-fire capability, allowing for single-shot semi-automatic fire or full-automatic fire. More compact and portable than standard [SMG](SMG.md)s, but less accurate, shorter range, and less powerful. Smaller and lighter than [Heavy SMG](Heavy SMG.md)s, prioritizing portability over range, accuracy, and damage. Larger and more controllable than [Machine Pistol](../Handguns/Pistols/Machine Pistol.md)s, offering better accuracy and range.

The most commonly encountered light submachine gun is the Uzi (introduced 1950), an Israeli-designed submachine gun that became popular worldwide with military and police forces. The Uzi features a fire selector with positions for safe, semi-automatic, and full-automatic fire. The Uzi's distinctive grip design and compact frame balance compact size, reliability, and rate of fire, and it is chambered in 9mm with high-capacity magazines. Biker gangs commonly use Uzis, favoring them for their reliability, compact size, and effective firepower in close-range engagements. Officers encountering light SMGs should be aware that these weapons, while smaller than heavy SMGs, still provide significant automatic firepower and are particularly effective in close-quarters combat situations.
