## Description

An open bolt lightweight submachine gun with improved cooling, allowing for longer bursts before the weapon needs to be cooled. Features a compact design with an overhanging bolt and telescoping bolt design that allows the weapon to be shorter while maintaining barrel length. The open-bolt design provides natural cooling, allowing for longer bursts before the weapon needs to cool down, while the compact frame makes it highly portable while still delivering effective firepower.

The most commonly encountered light submachine gun is the Uzi (1950), an Israeli-designed submachine gun that became popular worldwide with military and police forces. The Uzi's distinctive grip design and compact frame balance compact size, reliability, and rate of fire, and it is chambered in 9mm with high-capacity magazines. Biker gangs commonly use Uzis, favoring them for their reliability, compact size, and effective firepower in close-range engagements. Officers encountering light SMGs should be aware that these weapons, while smaller than heavy SMGs, still provide significant automatic firepower and are particularly effective in close-quarters combat situations.

## Combat Options

- **Triple Shot:** Fire a three-round burst in a single action
- **Hyperfire:** Unleash a rapid full-auto barrage, consuming additional ammo for maximum rate of fire
