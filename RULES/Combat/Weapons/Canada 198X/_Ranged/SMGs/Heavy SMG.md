## Description

A heavier version of the SMG with better damage and range. High rate of fire makes it excellent for close to medium range combat. Good balance between damage and fire rate. Requires two hands. These heavier, more substantial designs offer superior accuracy, better range, and more controllable recoil compared to compact SMGs, sacrificing some portability for increased stopping power, accuracy, and range.

The most commonly encountered heavy submachine guns are the Thompson SMG (1921), Sten SMG (1941), and Sterling L2A1 (1953). The Thompson is particularly favored by cultists, who seem drawn to its distinctive appearance and historical association with organized crime and prohibition-era violence. Some cult leaders speak of the weapon in reverent terms, claiming it was "meant to spill blood" and that its distinctive drum magazine and wooden stock hold dark ritual significance. Whether this is genuine belief or simply an affectation adopted from some shared source of inspiration is unclear, but the pattern is consistent enough that law enforcement has noted it. The Thompson's weight and design make it a preferred choice for sustained fire and medium-range engagements, though its heavy weight and distinctive profile make it less ideal for concealment. The Sten SMG saw extensive service with Commonwealth forces during World War II, and while obsolete for military service, examples may still be encountered in surplus stores, collections, or in the hands of veterans. When street-level gangs get their hands on a heavy SMG, it is typically the Sten, due to its availability from surplus sources and lower cost compared to the Thompson. The Sterling L2A1 and its Canadian licensed variant, the C1 Submachine Gun (1958), saw extensive service with Commonwealth and Canadian military forces from the 1950s through the 1980s. The Sterling's distinctive side-mounted magazine and perforated barrel shroud make it easily recognizable, and while primarily encountered with military personnel, examples may be found in surplus stores or, rarely, in criminal hands through theft from military sources. Officers encountering heavy SMGs should be aware that these weapons represent significantly greater firepower than standard SMGs, with better range and accuracy, making them particularly dangerous in close to medium-range engagements.
