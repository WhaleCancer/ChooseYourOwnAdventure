## Description

A heavier version of the SMG with better damage and range. High rate of fire makes it excellent for medium range combat. Good balance between damage and fire rate. Requires two hands. These heavier, more substantial designs offer superior accuracy, better range, and more controllable recoil compared to compact SMGs, sacrificing some portability for increased stopping power, accuracy, and range. More powerful and longer range than standard [SMG](SMG.md)s, but heavier and less portable. Heavier and more substantial than [Light SMG](Light SMG.md)s, offering better range, accuracy, and damage.

The most commonly encountered heavy submachine guns are the STEN (introduced 1941) and Sterling L2A1 (introduced 1953). The STEN saw extensive service with Commonwealth forces during World War II, and while obsolete for military service, examples may still be encountered in surplus stores, collections, or in the hands of veterans. When street-level gangs get their hands on a heavy SMG, it is typically the STEN, due to its availability from surplus sources and low cost.

The Sterling L2A1 and its Canadian licensed variant, the C1 Submachine Gun (introduced 1958), saw extensive service with Commonwealth and Canadian military forces from the 1950s through the 1980s. The Sterling's distinctive side-mounted magazine and perforated barrel shroud make it easily recognizable, and while primarily encountered with military personnel, examples may be found in surplus stores or, rarely, in criminal hands through theft from military sources.

Officers encountering heavy SMGs should be aware that these weapons represent significantly greater firepower than standard SMGs, with better range, accuracy, and damage, making them particularly dangerous in medium-range engagements.
