## Description

A heavy machine gun that fires a continuous stream of bullets at extremely high rate. Very high DPS but heavy, requires bracing, and consumes ammunition rapidly. Effective at suppressing multiple targets. These weapons use an external power source to rotate multiple barrels, allowing for extremely high rates of fire without overheating individual barrels. The Gatling-style mechanism prevents barrel overheating while delivering devastating suppressive fire. Due to weight, power requirements, and ammunition consumption, these weapons are almost exclusively vehicle-mounted or used with specialized harnesses.

The most commonly encountered rotary multi-barrel machine gun is the M134 Minigun (1960s), a six-barrel rotary machine gun firing 7.62×51mm NATO rounds at rates of 2,000-6,000 rounds per minute, typically mounted on helicopters, vehicles, or boats. These weapons are extremely rare in civilian or criminal contexts due to their size, weight, power requirements, and difficulty of acquisition. Officers encountering these weapons should exercise extreme caution, as they represent the highest sustained rate of fire available and can deliver devastating suppressive fire capable of suppressing entire areas. The presence of a minigun would indicate military, specialized law enforcement, or highly organized criminal activity with significant resources.
