## Combat Options

- **Sustained Fire:** Automatic fire mode allows for continuous suppressive fire
- **Armor Piercing:** Heavy-caliber ammunition can penetrate light armor and vehicles
- **Hyperfire:** This weapon is Hyperfire only - all attacks use the Hyperfire combat option. Empty a significant portion of ammunition in a single round to gain +2 to attack and +3 to damage (if sufficient ammo). See [Hyperfire](../../../Combat-Options/Hyperfire.md) for details.
- **Bracing Required:** This weapon requires bracing against a solid surface (or tripod/vehicle mount) to be used effectively. If fired without bracing, you suffer a -2 penalty to your attack roll. Bracing is used in association with Hyperfire. See [Bracing](../../../Combat-Options/Bracing.md) for details.
- **Bipod Fire:** Gain a +1 bonus to your attack roll when firing from a deployed bipod while prone or kneeling. Deploying the bipod requires a free interaction if already prone/kneeling, or costs your movement to go prone/kneeling. You cannot move in the same round when using bipod fire. Bipod Fire is used in association with Hyperfire. See [Bipod Fire](../../../Combat-Options/Bipod-Fire.md) for details.

## Description

A heavy machine gun designed for sustained automatic fire. Heavy and unwieldy, but delivers tremendous damage thanks to armor-piercing ammunition. Belt-fed ammunition ensures continuous fire as long as the person operating it can manage the weapon. These belt-fed machine guns fire full-power rifle ammunition (.30 caliber) or heavy-caliber rounds (.50 BMG), providing devastating firepower at extended ranges. Water-cooled variants offer sustained fire capability, while air-cooled versions are lighter but require more frequent barrel changes. These weapons are typically mounted on tripods, vehicles, or defensive positions due to their weight and recoil, though they can be fired from bipods in infantry support roles.

The most commonly encountered heavy machine guns are the C6 GPMG (adopted by the Canadian Armed Forces in the late 1970s, Canadian designation for FN MAG), M2 Browning .50 Caliber (adopted by the U.S. military in 1933), or FN MAG/M240 (adopted by the U.S. military in 1958). The C6 is the standard general purpose machine gun for Canadian Armed Forces, standard issue by 1985. Chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO with a rate of fire of approximately 650-1,000 rounds per minute, the C6 serves in both infantry support roles (with bipod) and vehicle-mounted configurations (with tripod). In 1985 British Columbia, the C6 is encountered primarily with Canadian military units, especially infantry sections, armored vehicles, or fixed defensive positions. The M2 Browning has been in continuous service since the 1930s, renowned for its reliability and stopping power, and is widely used by U.S. and allied forces. Officers encountering heavy machine guns should be aware that these weapons represent the most devastating portable firepower available, with the ability to penetrate light armor and provide sustained suppressive fire at extended ranges. These weapons are extremely rare in civilian or criminal hands due to size, weight, and difficulty of acquisition.
