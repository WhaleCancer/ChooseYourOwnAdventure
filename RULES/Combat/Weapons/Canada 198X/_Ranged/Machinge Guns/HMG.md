## Description

A heavy machine gun designed for sustained automatic fire. Heavy and unwieldy, but delivers tremendous damage thanks to armor-piercing ammunition. Belt-fed ammunition ensures continuous fire as long as the person operating it can manage the weapon. These belt-fed machine guns fire full-power rifle ammunition (.30 caliber) or heavy-caliber rounds (.50 BMG), providing devastating firepower at extended ranges. Water-cooled variants offer sustained fire capability, while air-cooled versions are lighter but require more frequent barrel changes. These weapons are typically mounted on tripods, vehicles, or defensive positions due to their weight and recoil.

The most commonly encountered heavy machine guns are the M2 Browning .50 Caliber (1933), FN MAG/M240 (1958), and C6 GPMG (Canadian designation for FN MAG). The C6 is the standard general purpose machine gun for Canadian Armed Forces, adopted in the late 1970s and standard issue by 1985. Chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO with a rate of fire of approximately 650-1,000 rounds per minute, the C6 serves in both infantry support roles (with bipod) and vehicle-mounted configurations (with tripod). In 1985 British Columbia, the C6 is encountered primarily with Canadian military units, especially infantry sections, armored vehicles, or fixed defensive positions. The M2 Browning has been in continuous service since the 1930s, renowned for its reliability and stopping power, and is widely used by U.S. and allied forces. Officers encountering heavy machine guns should be aware that these weapons represent the most devastating portable firepower available, with the ability to penetrate light armor and provide sustained suppressive fire at extended ranges. These weapons are extremely rare in civilian or criminal hands due to size, weight, and difficulty of acquisition.
