## Combat Options

- **Sustained Fire:** Automatic fire mode allows for continuous suppressive fire
- **Suppressive Fire:** Can lay down a pattern of fire to suppress multiple targets
- **Hyperfire:** This weapon is Hyperfire only - all attacks use the Hyperfire combat option. Empty a significant portion of ammunition in a single round to gain +2 to attack and +3 to damage (if sufficient ammo). See [Hyperfire](../../../Combat-Options/Hyperfire.md) for details.
- **Bracing Required:** This weapon requires bracing against a solid surface to be used effectively. If fired without bracing, you suffer a -2 penalty to your attack roll. Bracing is used in association with Hyperfire. See [Bracing](../../../Combat-Options/Bracing.md) for details.
- **Bipod Fire:** Gain a +1 bonus to your attack roll when firing from a deployed bipod while prone or kneeling. Deploying the bipod requires a free interaction if already prone/kneeling, or costs your movement to go prone/kneeling. You cannot move in the same round when using bipod fire. Bipod Fire is used in association with Hyperfire. See [Bipod Fire](../../../Combat-Options/Bipod-Fire.md) for details.

## Description

A light machine gun designed for sustained automatic fire. Good damage and rate of fire, effective at medium range. Heavier than [Assault Rifle](../Rifles/Assault Rifle.md)s but provides better suppressive fire capability. More portable than [HMG](HMG.md)s but less powerful. Requires two hands and benefits from bracing or bipod support for sustained fire. These belt-fed or magazine-fed light machine guns provide sustained automatic fire for infantry squads, bridging the gap between individual [Automatic Rifle](../Rifles/Automatic Rifle.md)s and heavier machine guns.

The most commonly encountered light machine guns are the C9 Light Machine Gun (adopted by the Canadian Armed Forces in the mid-1980s, FN Minimi variant), M249 SAW (adopted by the U.S. military in 1984), FN Minimi (introduced 1974), or M60 (adopted by the U.S. military in 1957). The C9 is the standard light machine gun for Canadian Armed Forces, being adopted to replace the older [C2A1](../Rifles/Automatic Rifle.md). Chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, the same cartridge as the C7 assault rifle, allowing for ammunition compatibility. The C9 features an integrated bipod and can be fed from belts or M16-style magazines. The M249 SAW became the standard squad automatic weapon for U.S. forces, offering high reliability and the ability to use both belts and standard M16 magazines. Officers encountering light machine guns should be aware that these weapons provide significantly greater sustained firepower than assault rifles and are designed to suppress multiple targets, making them particularly dangerous in tactical situations.
