## Description

An upscaled version of the pump shotgun designed for use by a warcasket. Each cartridge fired contains 4 pellets larger than slugs from a regular-sized shotgun, giving it better range, armor penetration and much better damage. The recoil is insane though, even for a warcasket’s recoil damping system.
