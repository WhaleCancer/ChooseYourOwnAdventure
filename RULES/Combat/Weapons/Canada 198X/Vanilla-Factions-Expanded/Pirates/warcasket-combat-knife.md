## Description

An upscaled version of the combat knife designed for use by a warcasket. It is only still called a knife due to size comparison to a warcasket, but it is capable of cleaving a man in half and is just as large. The preferred weapon for the faster moving warcaskets that prioritize lightly armored, isolated targets.
