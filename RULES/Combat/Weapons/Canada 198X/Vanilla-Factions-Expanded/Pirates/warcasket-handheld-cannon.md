## Description

Essentially a handheld smoothbore mortar that fires explosives in an arc, able to bypass enemy fortifications. Made by those who wanted to combine ancient naval warfare with modern technology. The accuracy is abysmal but the onboard fabricator ensures that artillery fire can be provided without ever needing a resupply.
