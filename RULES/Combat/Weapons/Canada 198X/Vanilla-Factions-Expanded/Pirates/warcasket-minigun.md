## Description

An upscaled version of the minigun designed for use by a warcasket. It uses larger caliber rounds which are poorly made en masse due to how many rounds need to be manufactured. Thus, it has a slower rate of fire and armor penetration, but who cares because no one wants to be on the receiving end of this amount of dakka.
