## Description

A monumental piece of anti-personnel technology that can only be properly utilized by the oversized warcaskets. Practically an engine block fitted to the end of a mech’s limb actuator, equipped with multiple pneumatic plates covering miniature repulsor generators designed for riot control. In layman’s terms, a strike from the head will launch the target backwards by several meters.
