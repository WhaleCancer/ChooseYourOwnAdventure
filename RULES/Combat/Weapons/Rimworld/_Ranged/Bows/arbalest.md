## Description

A powerful crossbow. Fires a heavy bolt over extreme distances, but takes a long time to cock it due to the need to use the cranequin.

Based on medieval arbalests (heavy crossbows) that used mechanical winding devices (cranequins) to draw the powerful bowstring. These weapons were capable of penetrating armor and had significantly greater range and power than standard crossbows, but required more time to reload. The arbalest represented the pinnacle of medieval crossbow technology, favored by professional soldiers and mercenaries for its devastating power despite the slow reload time.
