## Description

A light machine gun designed for sustained automatic fire. Good damage and rate of fire, effective at medium range. Heavier than assault rifles but provides better suppressive fire capability. Requires two hands and may need bracing. These belt-fed or magazine-fed light machine guns provide sustained automatic fire for infantry squads, bridging the gap between individual assault rifles and heavier machine guns.

The most commonly encountered light machine guns are the M249 SAW (1984), FN Minimi (1974), M60 (1957), C9 Light Machine Gun (FN Minimi variant, Canadian service), and the Browning Automatic Rifle or BAR (1918). The C9 is the standard light machine gun for Canadian Armed Forces, being adopted by Canadian forces in the mid-1980s to replace the older C2A1. Chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, the same cartridge as the C7 assault rifle, allowing for ammunition compatibility. The M249 SAW became the standard squad automatic weapon for U.S. forces, offering high reliability and the ability to use both belts and standard M16 magazines. The BAR, though obsolete for military service by 1985, may still be encountered in surplus stores or collections, representing an earlier era of automatic rifles designed for light machine gun roles. Officers encountering light machine guns should be aware that these weapons provide significantly greater sustained firepower than assault rifles and are designed to suppress multiple targets, making them particularly dangerous in tactical situations.
