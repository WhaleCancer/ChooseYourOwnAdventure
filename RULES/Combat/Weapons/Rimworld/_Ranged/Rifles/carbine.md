## Description

Short bullpup carbine, used often in close quarters urban combat.

Whilst it's accurate at close range, due to the short stock it is incapable of firing accurately at rifle range.

Based on carbines available in the 1980s, such as the M1 Carbine (1941), CAR-15/XM177 (1960s), or various shortened assault rifle variants. Carbines feature shorter barrels and often bullpup configurations, trading long-range accuracy for improved maneuverability in close-quarters combat. The bullpup design places the action behind the trigger, allowing for a full-length barrel in a compact package. These weapons are favored by vehicle crews, special forces, and urban combat specialists who need the firepower of a rifle in a more portable package.
