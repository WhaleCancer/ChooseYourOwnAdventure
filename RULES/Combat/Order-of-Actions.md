# Order of Actions

**Source:** CB77011 - Stellar Adventures, Page 11 [Page 0011](../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0011.png)

Every combat round is a manic maelstrom of blows and shots and explosions and so forth, and an "Action" is usually several attempts. However, Missile weapons are normally quicker to use, and so these are resolved first in a combat round. Next to be resolved are any special abilities and last to be resolved are any hand to hand combat actions.

Of course, a Director can change these actions depending on circumstances. A blade held to a throat can probably be used before the hostage can draw a blaster pistol and fire it!

In most combats, all attacks in that round are resolved simultaneously, and even if a character is killed or immobilized by an attack, they may still be able to inflict damage themselves.

## Delaying an Action

In some combat situations, it might make sense to wait to fire at an opponent until they get closer to you. With this action, you a Player can declare their Character is making a ranged attack at a particular creature or character, but only once they get into a certain range. An agent armed with a Melee weapon can also use this option to delay an attack until an opponent closes the distance to point blank range.
