# Combat Modifiers

Combat modifiers adjust the target number for attack rolls based on environmental conditions, range, cover, lighting, and other situational factors. These modifiers apply to both melee and ranged combat.

## Overview

The base target numbers are:

- **Melee Combat:** 15 (modified by defender's skill level)
- **Ranged Combat:** 15 (modified by defender's skill level)

Environmental and situational modifiers are added to or subtracted from these base target numbers to reflect the difficulty of the attack. These are common modifiers, but the Director (Game Master) is free to modify or add others as appropriate.

## Usage

When applying modifiers:
1. Start with the base target number (15 for both melee and ranged)
2. Add the defender's skill level
3. Apply all relevant environmental and situational modifiers
4. The attacker's roll must meet or exceed this modified target number

Modifiers stack - if multiple conditions apply, add all relevant modifiers together.

## Notes

- **Dark Seeing:** Characters with dark vision or night vision equipment reduce darkness penalties (Total Darkness: -3 instead of -6, Night Time Darkness: -1 instead of -3)
- **Outnumbering:** This bonus applies per extra attacker beyond the first, with a maximum bonus of +5
- **Aquatic Creatures:** Swimming penalties do not apply to creatures naturally adapted to aquatic environments
- **Mounted Combat:** The -2 penalty applies when an unmounted character attacks a mounted opponent
