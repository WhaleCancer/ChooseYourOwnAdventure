# Attack and Defense

In combat, **players roll all dice**. When a player attacks, they roll to hit using their own ability. When a player is attacked, they roll to defend using the opponent's ability. Players roll **2D6** and must roll **under** the appropriate value, modified by the opponent's skill and any [combat modifiers](Combat%20Modifiers.md). This system applies to both melee and ranged combat.

## When a Player Attacks

The player rolls **2D6** and must roll **under** their **PHYSICAL rating** plus their appropriate Skill (see Attacker Skills below), minus any [combat modifiers](Combat%20Modifiers.md) that apply. The exact formula depends on whether the attack is melee or ranged.

### Melee Attacks

For melee attacks, the defender's skill level reduces the attacker's roll.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Character's PHYSICAL + Character's Skill - Opponent's Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The Player provides their Character's PHYSICAL rating, their Character's skill level, and any applicable combat modifiers, while the Director provides the opponent's skill level.

### Ranged Attacks

For ranged attacks, the defender's weapon skill does not reduce the attacker's roll.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Character's PHYSICAL + Character's Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The Player provides their Character's PHYSICAL rating, their Character's skill level, and any applicable combat modifiers.

**Special Results:** If you roll double 6, the attack automatically hits and inflicts a critical hit. If you roll double 1, the attack automatically misses and the Character fumbles. See [Critical Hits](Critical%20Hits.md) and [Fumbles](Fumbles.md) for details.

### Melee Attacker Skills

The attacker uses one of the following skills when making a melee attack:

- **[Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md)** - For unarmed combat, knives, or improvised weapons
- **[Melee Weapons](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md)** - For swords, axes, clubs, staves, polearms, and other traditional melee weapons
  - [Axes](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Axes.md)
  - [Clubs](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Clubs.md)
  - [Polearms](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Polearms.md)
  - [Staves](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Staves.md)
  - [Swords](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee%20Weapons/Swords.md)
- **[Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md)** - For unarmed combat using martial arts techniques

### Ranged Attacker Skills

The attacker uses one of the following skills when making a ranged attack:

- **[Firearms-Light](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light.md)** - For pistols, rifles, shotguns, SMGs, and other light firearms
  - [Pistols](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/Pistols.md)
  - [Rifles](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/Rifles.md)

  - [SMGs](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Light/SMGs.md)
- **[Firearms-Heavy](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy.md)** - For machine guns, heavy weapons, and launchers
  - [Heavy-Machine-Guns](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy/Heavy-Machine-Guns.md)
  - [Launchers](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy/Launchers.md)
  - [Energy-Throwers](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Firearms-Heavy/Energy-Throwers.md)

  - [Bows](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Missile%20Weapons/Bows.md)
  - [Thrown](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Ranged-Weapons/Missile%20Weapons/Thrown.md)

## When a Player is Attacked

### Defending Against Melee Attacks

When a player is attacked in melee, they roll **2D6** and must roll **under** the attacker's **PHYSICAL rating** plus the attacker's skill level, minus the player's appropriate Skill (see Melee Defender Skills below), minus any [combat modifiers](Combat%20Modifiers.md) that apply. If the player's defense roll is under this modified value, they avoid the attack. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, they are hit.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Opponent's PHYSICAL + Opponent's Skill - Character's Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The Director provides the opponent's PHYSICAL rating and skill level (the base target number), while the Player provides the Character's skill level and any applicable combat modifiers to subtract from the target number.

**Special Results:** If you roll double 6, the attacker fumbles their attack and the Character automatically avoids the attack regardless of the roll result. If you roll double 1, the attacker scores a critical hit and the Character automatically fails to defend, being hit with a critical hit. See [Fumbles](Fumbles.md) and [Critical Hits](Critical%20Hits.md) for details.

### Defending Against Ranged Attacks

When a player is attacked at range, they roll **2D6** and must roll **under** the attacker's **PHYSICAL rating** plus the attacker's skill level, minus the player's appropriate Skill (see Ranged Defender Skills below), minus any [combat modifiers](Combat%20Modifiers.md) that apply. If the player's defense roll is under this modified value, they avoid the attack. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, they are hit. **Weapon skills cannot be used to defend against ranged attacks** - only Dodge or Armor (with shield) may be used.

**Formula:** Roll 2D6 under (Opponent's PHYSICAL + Opponent's Skill - Character's Dodge/Armor Skill - Combat Modifiers)

The Director provides the opponent's PHYSICAL rating and skill level (the base target number), while the Player provides the Character's Dodge or Armor skill level and any applicable combat modifiers to subtract from the target number.

**Special Results:** If you roll double 6, the attacker fumbles their attack and the Character automatically avoids the attack regardless of the roll result. If you roll double 1, the attacker scores a critical hit and the Character automatically fails to defend, being hit with a critical hit. See [Fumbles](Fumbles.md) and [Critical Hits](Critical%20Hits.md) for details.

### Melee Defender Skills

The player uses one of the following skills when defending against a melee attack. The player's skill level is **subtracted** from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill), making it easier to defend:

- **Weapon Skill** (default) - The player subtracts their weapon skill level (from the Melee Attacker Skills list above) from the opponent's ability. [Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) cannot be used as a defender skill against [Melee Weapons](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Melee-Weapons.md) or [Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md), except when the attacker is using a melee weapon but has insufficient skill to wield it properly. In that case, the defender may use Brawling.
- **[Armor](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md)** - Used by defenders wielding a shield; the player may subtract either their Armor skill level or their weapon skill level from the opponent's ability.
- **[Dodge](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md)** - Used by defenders who are not wearing armor; the player may use their Dodge skill level instead of their weapon skill, subtracting it from the opponent's ability.

### Ranged Defender Skills

The player uses one of the following skills when defending against a ranged attack. The player's skill level is **subtracted** from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill), making it easier to defend. **Weapon skills cannot be used to defend against ranged attacks.**

- **[Dodge](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md)** - The player may use their Dodge skill level, subtracting it from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill). This represents evasive movement and taking cover.
- **[Armor](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md)** - Used by defenders wielding a shield; the player may subtract their Armor skill level from the opponent's ability (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill).

## Resolution

### Attacking

**Melee Attacks:** If the player's attack roll is under the modified value (PHYSICAL + skill - opponent's skill - modifiers), they hit and inflict damage. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, the attack misses.

**Ranged Attacks:** If the player's attack roll is under the modified value (PHYSICAL + skill - modifiers), they hit and inflict damage. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, the attack misses. Note that the defender's weapon skill does not reduce the attacker's roll for ranged attacks.

If the attack hits, the player rolls another D6 and compares the roll to their weapon damage table. The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS damage inflicted. The defender (NPC or another player) then rolls a D6 and compares the value to their [Armor](Armor-Rimworld.md) or [Dodge](Dodge.md) table (whichever they are using). The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the target.

### Defending

**Melee Attacks:** If the player's defense roll is under the modified value (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill - player's skill - modifiers), they avoid the attack. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, they are hit.

**Ranged Attacks:** If the player's defense roll is under the modified value (opponent's PHYSICAL + opponent's skill - player's Dodge/Armor skill - modifiers), they avoid the attack. If the roll equals or exceeds this value, they are hit. Note that weapon skills cannot be used to defend against ranged attacks.

If the player is hit, the attacker (NPC or another player) determines damage from their weapon damage table. The player then rolls a D6 and compares the value to their [Armor](Armor-Rimworld.md) or [Dodge](Dodge.md) table (whichever they are using). The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the player's current STAMINA POINTS.

If a character's STAMINA POINTS are reduced to 0 or lower, see [Death and Dying](Death%20and%20Dying.md) for the rules on unconsciousness, dying, and death.

Once all of this has been worked out for all combats taking place, the round is over and the next one will start.

## Leaving Melee Combat

Melee combat occurs when a character is adjacent to an enemy who is wielding a melee weapon. [Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md) counts as a melee weapon for this purpose. [Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) weapons such as brass knuckles or knives do not count as melee weapons for this purpose.

In order to escape from melee combat, a character must, at the start of the round, either make a successful [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) Skill roll (using PHYSICAL) or Test their LUCK. If this roll is failed, the character or monster must remain in melee combat that round and fight on, or else be automatically hit once by every enemy they are facing. They may of course re-attempt to leave on the following round.

If the [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) or LUCK test is successful, the combatant may leave the melee without incident and move away.
