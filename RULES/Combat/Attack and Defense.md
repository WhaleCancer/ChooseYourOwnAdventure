# Attack and Defense

In combat, **players roll all dice**. When a player attacks, they roll to hit using their own ability. When a player is attacked, they roll to defend using the opponent's ability. Players roll **2D6** and must roll **under** the appropriate value, modified by [combat modifiers](Combat%20Modifiers.md). The key difference between melee and ranged combat is that for melee attacks, the defender's skill level reduces the attacker's roll, while for ranged attacks, the defender's weapon skill does not affect the attacker's roll. This system applies to both melee and ranged combat.
