# Combat Options

Most of the time, shoot‑outs and bar fights in EPIC can be resolved using the **standard attack rules**: roll to hit, then roll on the weapon's damage track and subtract armour. However, when the scene slows down around bullet time or a character does something bold, you can use **Combat Options** to bend the rules.

## Combat Options System

A character may normally declare **one Combat Option per round** (unless the option says otherwise). The option must be **announced before rolling** any attacks that round. Unless noted, options apply to **one attack** or **one opposed combat** for that round only.

Some options are only available to **melee attacks**, and some require particular **weapon types** (for example, automatic weapons or scoped rifles). Use the generic weapon types in [Weapons](./RULES/Weapons\.md) to decide which options are legal.
