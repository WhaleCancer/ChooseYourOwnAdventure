# Fumbles

If a Character rolls a double 1 when making their combat roll, they have fumbled and will automatically lose that combat round regardless of combat totals. The fumbling Character must roll 2D6 on the appropriate table below and apply the effects immediately.

A Character may, before the Fumble is resolved, Test their LUCK if they suffer a fumble themselves. If successful, the fumble effects are reduced in severity (GM's discretion), but the Character will still lose that combat round versus all enemies.

If both combatants roll double 1, then both make rolls on the fumble table, and both weapons will also shatter in addition to any other effects (magical weapons never shatter in this way).
