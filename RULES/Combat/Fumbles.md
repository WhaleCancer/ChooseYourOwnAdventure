Whereas a roll of a double 6 is usually bad news for the target, a roll of a double 1 is bad for the attacker. A double 1 is a Fumble, and as such will always result in losing that combat round, regardless of the combat totals. The Fumbling character must also make a 2D6 roll on the appropriate table below and apply the effects immediately.

Like Critical Hits, the effects of a Fumble can also be partly negated by a successful LUCK roll. This roll must be made before the exact fumble is generated and thus the severity known. However, even with a successful LUCK roll, the Character will still lose that combat round versus all enemies.

If a combat roll is a double 1, that combatant has fumbled their weapon and will automatically lose that round regardless of the combat totals. In addition, the loser must roll 2D6 and find out the effect of the fumble on the following table. If both combatants roll double 1, then not only do both make rolls on the fumble table, but both weapons will also shatter in addition to any other effects. Magical weapons never shatter in this way.
