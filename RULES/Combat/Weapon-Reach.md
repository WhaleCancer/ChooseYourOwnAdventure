# Weapon Reach

## Source Material

This rule is adapted from the **Advanced Fighting Fantasy Combat Companion** (page 23), where it is presented as an optional rule. In EPIC, this rule is in full effect.

## Overview

Under standard rules, characters in melee can only attack and be attacked by enemies in the same melee. A character standing behind comrades engaged in battle cannot attack or be attacked by the enemies they are fighting.

The Weapon Reach rule allows characters wielding long-shafted weapons (spears, polearms, or similar weapons) to attack from the second rank, providing tactical advantages in formation fighting.

## Rules

### Second Rank Attacks

A character wielding a spear, polearm, or similar long-shafted weapon may attack from the second rank. This means that a character standing behind their comrades can attack enemies engaged with those in front.

**Example**: Two warriors are fighting three Orcs in melee. A third warrior standing behind them can attack one of the Orcs with a spear. Unless one of the Orcs also has a spear or polearm, they cannot attack that third warrior in return.

### Restrictions

- Only characters with **spears, polearms, or similar long-shafted weapons** can use this rule.
- Enemies with long-shafted weapons can attack characters in the second rank.
- The Director must determine who can attack whom based on positioning and weapon types.

### Positioning and Tactics

The Director must work out what rolls apply to which combatants and who can hit whom. Situations with multiple ranks of spear-wielding combatants can become complex and require careful adjudication.

The Director must also consider whether a "front line" can prevent the enemy from wrapping around and directly fighting the spearmen behind:

- **Narrow spaces** (e.g., a 10-foot corridor): Two warriors can block the corridor, preventing enemies from getting past to attack spearmen behind.
- **Open areas** (e.g., an open field): Two warriors facing six enemies would not be able to prevent some of the enemy from working their way around to attack any spearmen behind.

These situations must be decided on a case-by-case basis by the Director based on terrain, positioning, and the number of combatants involved.
