A Character can specialize in specific schools of Martial Arts. Each school has a specific focus—some emphasize avoiding blows, others concentrate on hard and fast blows, and so on. To specialize, a Character needs at least Rank 2 in the Martial Arts Skill and may require a teacher if specialization occurs after character creation.

A Hero reaching Rank 2 in Martial Arts does not have to specialize, but can choose to later.

## Specialization Requirements

Training for specialization requires a Character to have at least Rank 4 in the Martial Arts Skill and be taught by a Character of the same school, typically taking some months of dedicated training.

## Specialization Limitations

A Character can only learn one school and cannot change their specialization. Once specialized, they must always use that style when employing the Martial Arts Skill. For example, a Mukade school martial artist always has a bonus to damage and a penalty to dodge rolls, and cannot "switch off" their specialisation.

## Choosing a School

There are various schools, each with advantages and disadvantages, and the choice should be made carefully.

## Cangui School

The Cangui are a predatory worm from Hachiman. This school mimics the mesmerism of the Cangui to set up powerful attacks. Practitioners are slow and thoughtful.

**Effect:**

- Applies a -1 penalty to all combat rolls made using the Martial Arts Skill.
- If a successful attack results in a damage roll of 6, the target is stunned for the following round.
- Stunned targets can still make a combat roll (at -2) but inflict no damage if they win, and cannot cast spells or use special abilities.
- This stun effect applies only to living creatures and only if a damage dice is actually rolled.

## Hac-Quel-Rat School

This school is from the Isles of the Dawn, based on a creature that uses an enemy's strength against them. It's devastating against powerful opponents but ineffective against small or weak ones.

**Effect:**

- The damage roll on a successful attack is modified by the difference in SKILL between the martial artist and the target.
- For every point the target's SKILL is higher than the martial artist's, the damage roll increases by +1.
- For every point the target's SKILL is lower than the martial artist's, the damage roll decreases by -1.
- A result of 0 or less on the damage roll means no damage is inflicted.

## Kappa School

The Kappa are swamp-dwelling humanoids from Hachiman, known for their balance, which is linked to a water-filled depression on their heads. The style emphasizes balance, especially against multiple opponents. Practitioners walk carefully with poise even out of combat.

**Effect:**

- If the martial artist is fighting a single opponent, Dodge rolls to reduce damage suffer a -1 penalty, with a minimum result of 1.
- If the martial artist is fighting two or more opponents, all Dodge rolls have a +1 bonus.

---

## Ki-Rin School

Living in the mountains of Hachiman, the Ki-Rin are a powerful celestial hybrid creature. They have a natural aura of calm and peace, but are dedicated enemies of evil. Martial artists who follow this school are able to use an aura of calm to slip in and out of combat without creating a metaphorical ripple. Martial artists of this school are always calm and peaceful, whatever is going on around them.

**Effect:**

- Allows a martial artist to leave combat at will without penalty.
- Sets a maximum damage roll of 6, regardless of modifiers, and prohibits the use of the 7+ column on the martial arts damage track.

## Kreehul School

On the Isles of the Dawn live a rare and unusual toad-like humanoid: the Kreehul. These creatures lurk patiently just under the surface of the water guarding their idols. As soon as an enemy launches an attack, they hit back harder. This school practices restraint and turns an attack by the enemy into a counter attack by the martial artist. Outside of combat these martial artists are rarely proactive, normally waiting for something to happen before responding.

**Effect:**

- Grants a +1 bonus to all combat totals.
- However, they can only inflict martial arts damage on an enemy that is directly attacking them.
- If they win a combat round against an opponent attacking someone else (or not attacking at all), they deal no damage.

---

## Mukade School

The Mukade, vast giant centipedes, are a real danger to the travellers of Hachiman. They strike hard and fast from a place of hiding, giving little thought to their own defence. This school of martial arts also teaches its followers to strike hard at the enemy, even at a personal risk of damage. Followers of this school tend to be bluff and physical most of the time.

**Effect:**

- Provides a +1 bonus to martial arts damage rolls but imposes a -1 penalty to armor and dodge rolls used to reduce damage.
- If the damage reduction roll is 0 or below, no damage is stopped.

---

## Pelagine School

These fish-men are slow in action but spiky and hard to damage. This school of martial arts practices slow and steady movements, but if an enemy does actually land a blow, the martial artist will immediately retaliate, using the energy of the attackers' blow to strike back. Attacking a martial artist of this school can be a painful experience!

**Effect:**

- Applies a -2 penalty to all combat total rolls made using martial arts.
- If the martial artist loses a combat round, they still inflict 1 STAMINA point of damage on the successful attacker.
- Armor applies to this damage, but Dodging does not.

---

## Shikome School

The Shikome are an ape-like humanoid, bred for war. They are known for their battle awareness, and this school teaches that it is impossible to be surrounded by enemies. It doesn't matter how many enemies there are, a Shikome martial artist will never have a rear or flank! Outside combat, martial artists of this school are skittish and their eyes constantly dart about looking for hidden enemies.

**Effect:**

- A martial artist of this school cannot be outnumbered, regardless of the number of opponents.
- However, all combat rolls are reduced by -1.

---

## Tatsu School

The Dragons of Hachiman, known as Tatsu, are graceful and difficult to hit in battle. This school focuses on grace and speed, and its adherents are difficult to hit. Even outside battle, these martial artists seem to slide through life with perfect grace.

**Effect:**

- Damage rolls made by a martial artist of this school are reduced by -1 (if the result is 0, no damage is inflicted).
- All rolls to reduce damage using Dodge receive a +1 bonus, which increases to +2 against arrows.
