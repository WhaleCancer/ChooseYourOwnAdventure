# Death and Dying

An Character reduced to -4 STAMINA POINTS dies immediately, but if reduced to 0 STAMINA POINTS only begins to die. The character must immediately Test their LUCK. If the test is a success, the Character is stable and will not continue dying unless they take further damage. If the test is a failure, it must be repeated on the following (and every subsequent) round until either the test is a success, or LUCK reaches 0, at which point the Character will die.

This process can be stopped by another Character by using the First Aid Special Skill. This attempt will require 1d3 rounds to attempt, and also requires a special skill test to halt the dying process. The dying Character must still Test for LUCK during this attempt.

When an NPC is reduced to 0 STAMINA POINTS, they are out of the fight and probably dead (although the final state of said character may be decided by the Director). If a Character reaches 0 STAMINA POINTS, they are unconscious, but a Character on -4 STAMINA POINTS is dead. A character who has between -1 and -3 STAMINA POINTS will lose 1 LUCK point at the start of every subsequent round, and if LUCK also reaches 0, that character will die.
