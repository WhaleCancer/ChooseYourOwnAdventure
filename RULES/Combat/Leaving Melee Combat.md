# Leaving Melee Combat

Melee combat occurs when a character is adjacent to an enemy who is wielding a melee weapon. [Martial Arts](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Martial-Arts.md) counts as a melee weapon for this purpose. [Brawling](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Melee-Combat/Brawling.md) weapons such as brass knuckles or knives do not count as melee weapons for this purpose.

In order to escape from melee combat, a character must, at the start of the round, either make a successful [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) Skill roll (using PHYSICAL) or Test their LUCK. If this roll is failed, the character or monster must remain in melee combat that round and fight on, or else be automatically hit once by every enemy they are facing. They may of course re-attempt to leave on the following round.

If the [Acrobatics](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Acrobatics.md) or LUCK test is successful, the combatant may leave the melee without incident and move away.
