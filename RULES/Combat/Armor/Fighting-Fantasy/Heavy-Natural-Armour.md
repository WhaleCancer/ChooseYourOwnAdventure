## Description

Heavy natural armor represents the natural protection provided by tough monster hides, thick scales, dense skeletal structures, or other natural defensive features. This can apply to creatures with exceptionally thick skin, bony plates, or other natural armor that provides substantial protection equivalent to heavy manufactured armor.

This armor type is used for creatures whose natural physical structure provides protection equivalent to heavy monster armor, such as dragons with thick scales, undead creatures with dense skeletal structures, or other monsters with naturally tough hides.
