# Armor

## Armor System

Armor is essential for protection against the many hazards of combat (arrows, swords, claws, energy weapons). However, armor is heavy, difficult to use, and can interfere with magic, but most Characters will wear the best armor they can afford.

When a character takes damage, they roll a D6 and compare the value to their Armor protection track. The value from that track is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the character.

Each armor type has a Protection Track similar to a weapon's Damage track. A rolled number corresponds to a protection value, which is deducted from STAMINA POINTS damage.

Characters need armor for survival, but dodging can also be effective. Lacking both is dangerous.

### Armor Proficiency

See [Armor Proficiency](Armor%20Proficiency.md) for rules on armor proficiency and penalties for insufficient skill.

### Sealed Armor

Some armors are sealed, providing protection against poison gas, smoke, and lack of oxygen, functioning as spacesuits. They also protect against certain weapons.

### Dodge and Armor

A character with at least 1 point in the [Dodge](../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Dodge.md) skill can attempt to avoid hand-to-hand and missile attacks. Each Dodge rating provides its own armor track. Dodge can be used with armor, but values don't add; instead, a single armor roll is made, both tables are consulted, and the highest value is used.

### Shields

Some settings and tech levels allow shields. Shield protection is added to armor protection. For example, a Chainmail Cuirass and Large Shield reducing damage by 3 on an armor roll of 5. Only one armor roll is made for both.

Some shields require a free hand (cannot use with rifles/heavy weapons), and all high-tech shields require power packs (ammo). Low-tech shields (primitive or riot shields) work against melee but not ranged weapons. Armor skill is not required for a Small Shield, but is for a Large Shield. Using a Large Shield with heavy armor without sufficient skill can lead to multiple physical penalties.

A personal hi-tech shield uses up 1 charge each time it actually stops damage. If the shield fails to stop any damage, a charge is not used. The shield will not function at all with an empty power pack and it takes a full round to reload the unit.
