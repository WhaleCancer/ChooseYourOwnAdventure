In hand-to-hand combat, when a character takes damage, they roll a D6 and compare the value to their Armor table. The value from that table is the amount of STAMINA POINTS protection provided and should be deducted from the damage inflicted. Whatever damage is left should be deducted from the current STAMINA POINTS of the character.

Armour is essential for protection against the many hazards of combat (arrows, swords, claws). However, armour is heavy, difficult to use and can interfere with magic, but most Heroes will wear the best armour they can afford.

Heroes must be trained in wearing armour or suffer penalties. A Hero's Armour Special Skill total (Armour Special Skill plus SKILL characteristic) should be compared to the listed values below. If a Hero's total is insufficient, the difference is deducted from all physical SKILL tests, including combat. For example, a fighter with a total of 8 wearing chainmail hauberk (requiring 10) would suffer a -2 penalty.

Talents, Spells, or Priestly powers can provide bonuses to the armour roll, potentially increasing the result to a 7 or more.

Shield protection is added to armour protection. For example, a Chainmail Cuirass and Large Shield reducing damage by 3 on an armour roll of 5. Only one armour roll is made for both. Armour Special Skill is not required for a Small Shield, but is for a Large Shield. Using a Large Shield with heavy armour without sufficient skill can lead to multiple physical penalties.

### Master Weapons and Armour

An alternative for a Hero with money but who has been unable to find magical equipment may well decide to invest in some equipment made by a master armourer or weaponsmith. Better than standard quality equipment but not as good as magical, this equipment can however be a great stopgap.

These items are 4x the standard cost, and can only be purchased from a master craftsman. Generally, these will only be found in cities and the largest towns, although Dwarven masters seem to be found in much smaller settlements also. It may also be necessary to specially commission these items from the craftsman, and so there may be a wait before they are ready. It is normally not possible to just buy a masterwork sword off the shelf!

Master armour follows the same principle as master weapons. However, any result of a 0 is not improved as the armour does not protect areas that armour type would not normally cover.

Thus a Breastplate, which does not protect at all on a roll of a 1, 2 or 3, will only have better protection on the 4 result.

A master leather hauberk, which protects for 1 STAMINA point of damage on results 2-6 will then have the following profile:

| Roll | Normal | Master |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 1 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | 2 |
| 7+ | 2 | 2 |

### Acquired Traits

**Source:** CB77021 - Combat Companion, Page 34 [Page 0034](../../CB77021_Combat_Companion_Pages/page_0034.png)

Some magical weapons are created by wizards, alchemists and other magical folk who spend years imparting magical energies into a sword or helmet. This is not the only way that a weapon or armour can become magical however.

A weapon or item of armour used by a Hero for a long time and integral to great and heroic deeds can start to absorb some of the legend of their wielder or wearer and themselves become powerful. This accumulation of power is slow and uncertain and depends on the discretion of the Director. It can only apply to one item used by a Hero, and the item must be used across one or more campaigns. An item can be magical at the start of this process, but cannot be an artefact.

If for example a Hero uses a sword across a whole campaign, culminating in the slaying of a great and powerful Dragon, the Director may grant the sword a +1 bonus to attack with, increased to +2 to combat rolls and +1 to damage against Dragons. A shield used in a campaign focusing on combating an undead menace might provide a bonus of +1 to Armour rolls against any undead enemies. A staff used by a wizard in a campaign to defeat a Demon Lord might grant +1 to all casting rolls, and increase the damage of any spells cast against Demons by 1 STAMINA.

It is possible for an item to accumulate more powers if the character continues to use the item. The Dragon Sword, used in a further campaign against a Chaos Warrior horde might also acquire the power of applying -1 to enemy armour rolls. An item used across multiple campaigns by the same Hero could end up being very powerful indeed.

However, an item may only acquire power once at the culmination of a campaign (maybe even just as the final showdown begins) and a character may only have a single item that is acquiring powers this way.

Whilst the Hero lives, this item will be intrinsically linked to the Hero and any accumulated powers will manifest only when the item is used by it's owner. Anyone else using the item will find it just a usual example of it's kind.

Once the Hero dies however, the powers in the item will become permanent and useable by anyone. If the Hero dies in a specially heroic way, sacrificing themself to defeat some great enemy, the item will accumulate an extra power at that time.

The Director will be the sole arbiter of which powers are acquired and when, and also which item is the receptacle for the power. This system is designed to both encourage a player to build power rather than constantly looking to replace and upgrade their existing gear. It is also one way of a Hero leaving a legacy on the world of Titan, an item to both recall their great deeds.
