# Armor - Stellar Adventures

## Armor System

The introduction of more and more powerful weapons has in turn driven the development of better and better armour to protect the soldiers and mercenaries of the galaxy. This armour ranges from a simple armoured vest to full powered body armour weighing a ton or more. The Armor special skill represents training in wearing and using this armour effectively.

Characters need armour for survival, but dodging can also be effective. Lacking both is dangerous.

Each armour type has a Protection Track similar to a weapon's Damage track. A rolled number corresponds to a protection value, which is deducted from STAMINA damage.

Many armours require the Armour Special Skill to be used freely. Without sufficient skill, the character still gets protection but suffers a penalty to all other physical actions (including combat) equal to the skill shortfall. An example: untrained in Armour skill (requirement 2) wearing Guard Armour incurs a -2 penalty; wearing Heavy Battle Armour incurs a -4 penalty.

Some armours are sealed, providing protection against poison gas, smoke, and lack of oxygen, functioning as spacesuits. They also protect against certain weapons.

A character with at least 1 point in the Dodge special skill can attempt to avoid hand-to-hand and missile attacks. Each Dodge rating provides its own armour track. Dodge can be used with armour, but values don't add; instead, a single Armour roll is made, both tables are consulted, and the highest value is used.

Some settings and tech levels allow shields. Some require a free hand (cannot use with rifles/heavy weapons), and all high-tech shields require power packs (ammo). Low-tech shields (primitive or riot shields) work against melee but not ranged weapons.

A personal hi-tech shield uses up 1 charge each time it actually stops damage. If the shield fails to stop any damage, a charge is not used. The shield will not function at all with an empty power pack and it takes a full round to reload the unit.
