# Master Armor

An alternative for a Character with money but who has been unable to find magical equipment may well decide to invest in some equipment made by a master armourer or weaponsmith. Better than standard quality equipment but not as good as magical, this equipment can however be a great stopgap.

These items are 4x the standard cost, and can only be purchased from a master craftsman. Generally, these will only be found in cities and the largest towns, although Dwarven masters seem to be found in much smaller settlements also. It may also be necessary to specially commission these items from the craftsman, and so there may be a wait before they are ready. It is normally not possible to just buy a masterwork sword off the shelf!

Master armor follows the same principle as master weapons. However, any result of a 0 is not improved as the armor does not protect areas that armor type would not normally cover.

Thus a Breastplate, which does not protect at all on a roll of a 1, 2 or 3, will only have better protection on the 4 result.

A master leather hauberk, which protects for 1 STAMINA POINT of damage on results 2-6 will then have the following profile:

| Roll | Normal | Master |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 1 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 | 2 |
| 7+ | 2 | 2 |
