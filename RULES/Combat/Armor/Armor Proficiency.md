# Armor Proficiency

Many armors require the [Armor](../../../Skills/PHYSICAL/Armor%20(Special%20Skill).md) skill to be used freely. Armor descriptions will indicate the required skill level needed. If a character's skill level is less than the required skill level, they suffer a penalty to all PHYSICAL actions equal to the difference between their skill level and the required skill level. The character still gets protection from the armor despite insufficient skill.

> ## Examples
>
> A character with an Armor skill level of 1 wearing chainmail hauberk (requiring 2) would suffer a -1 penalty to all PHYSICAL actions. An untrained character (requirement 2) wearing Guard Armour incurs a -2 penalty to all PHYSICAL actions; wearing Heavy Battle Armour (requiring 4) incurs a -4 penalty to all PHYSICAL actions.
