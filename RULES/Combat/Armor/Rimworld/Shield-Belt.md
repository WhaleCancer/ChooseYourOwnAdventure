## Description

A personal shield generator that creates an energy barrier around the wearer. Blocks all incoming damage until the shield's energy is depleted, at which point it must recharge. Cannot be used with ranged weapons due to interference. Essential for melee combatants and close-quarters fighting. The shield will temporarily drop when the wearer fires a ranged weapon.
