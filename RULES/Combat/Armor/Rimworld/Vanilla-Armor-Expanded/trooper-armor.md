## Description

A suit of light minimally-powered armor. Lightweight plasteel-weave plates block attacks, and neuro-memetic assistors in the lower body redistribute weight carried by its user. It is slimmer than other powered armor and can fit under clothes.\n\nArmor like this is often used by imperial conscripts and late-midworld military forces.
