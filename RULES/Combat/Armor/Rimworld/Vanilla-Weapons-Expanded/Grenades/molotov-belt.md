## Description

Glass bottles filled with flammable liquid, with a burning cloth in the neck, strapped to a belt. A favorite weapon of hooligans and desperate warriors from rim to rim. They can be thrown a short distance, where they'll explode, damaging anything and anyone nearby, setting chemfuel on fire. Can be reloaded using molotovs.
