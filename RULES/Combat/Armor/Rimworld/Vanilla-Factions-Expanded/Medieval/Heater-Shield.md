## Description

A heavy medium-sized steel shield. Offers a significant amount of protection against melee and ranged attacks.

Based on heater shields used by medieval knights and men-at-arms from the 12th through 15th centuries. The distinctive shield shape (resembling an inverted triangle or iron) was designed to protect the body while allowing for effective use of weapons. Heater shields were typically made of wood covered with leather and reinforced with metal bands or entirely constructed of steel. They were carried on the left arm and could deflect both melee and ranged attacks. The curved design helped deflect blows and arrows, while the size balanced protection with maneuverability. Heater shields often displayed heraldic devices, making them both protective equipment and symbols of identity.
