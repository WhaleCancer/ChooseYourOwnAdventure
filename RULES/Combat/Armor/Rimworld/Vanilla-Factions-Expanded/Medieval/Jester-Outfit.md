## Description

A colorful jester outfit. It predisposes to conversation, but it's impossible to learn anything in such a suit.

Based on jester costumes worn by court jesters in medieval European courts. These brightly colored, often multi-patterned outfits were designed to make jesters instantly recognizable and entertaining. Jester outfits typically featured mismatched patterns, bright colors, and bells, serving as the visual symbol of the jester's role. While primarily for entertainment, the distinctive appearance helped jesters navigate the dangerous waters of court politics, as their role as entertainers sometimes allowed them to speak truths that others could not. The elaborate costume was essential to the jester's identity and function in medieval society.
