## Description

A hat worthy of a jester. Each half is different from the other one in color.

Based on traditional jester caps worn by court jesters and entertainers in medieval Europe. These distinctive multi-colored caps featured bells and floppy points, serving as the visual symbol of the jester's role as court entertainer and sometimes advisor. Jester hats were typically brightly colored, often with different patterns or colors on each side, making jesters instantly recognizable. While primarily decorative, the padding could provide minimal protection. Jesters held unique positions in medieval courts, able to speak truth to power through humor and entertainment.
