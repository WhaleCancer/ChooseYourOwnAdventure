## Description

A simple leather helmet designed to not block one's communication during combat. Often worn by front line, shield-wielding infantry to soak damage.

Based on padded coifs and soft caps worn by medieval soldiers, either as standalone head protection or as padding beneath helmets. These quilted cloth or leather caps provided basic impact protection and cushioning, making them ideal for common soldiers who needed affordable protection. Padded helmets were comfortable, didn't restrict vision or hearing, and could be easily repaired or replaced. They were often the first piece of armor a soldier would acquire, providing essential head protection without the cost or weight of metal helmets.
