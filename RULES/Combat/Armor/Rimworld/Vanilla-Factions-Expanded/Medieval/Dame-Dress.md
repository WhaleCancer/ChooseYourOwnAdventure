## Description

A beautiful full body dress for a dame. Wearing such clothes will inevitably lead to getting used to luxury, so the user will not be capable of dumb labor.

Based on elaborate dresses worn by noblewomen in medieval Europe. These ornate gowns featured multiple layers, rich fabrics, and intricate tailoring, displaying the wearer's wealth and status. Dame dresses were fashionable garments that restricted physical activity, symbolizing the noblewoman's elevated social position where manual labor was beneath her station. The elaborate construction and luxurious materials made these dresses impractical for physical work, reinforcing social hierarchies. Noblewomen's dress was a visible expression of status and wealth in medieval society.
