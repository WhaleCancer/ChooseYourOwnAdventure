## Description

A thick, quilted garment designed to absorb impacts and provide moderate protection. Often used by foot soldiers or worn under heavier armor.

Based on gambesons and padded armor (aketons) worn throughout medieval Europe. These quilted garments consisted of layers of fabric or linen stuffed with padding (wool, cotton, or scrap cloth), providing effective protection against cuts and blunt force trauma. Padded armor was often worn as standalone protection by common soldiers or as undergarments beneath mail or plate armor. The padding could absorb impact energy, reducing the effectiveness of blunt weapons and cushioning blows that penetrated outer armor. Padded armor was affordable, comfortable, and could be easily repaired, making it the most common form of armor for medieval infantry.
