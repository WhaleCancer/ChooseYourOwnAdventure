## Description

A heavy leather breastplate meant to provide warmth and protection to heavy infantry during battles in frigid tundras. Unfortunately, this armor leaves one slowed and more vulnerable to melee attacks.

Based on heavy leather armor used by Viking and Norse warriors, consisting of multiple layers of hardened leather. This armor provided good protection against slashing attacks and offered insulation against cold climates, making it ideal for northern European warfare. Heavy leather armor was more flexible and less restrictive than metal plate, allowing for greater mobility, though it provided less protection against piercing attacks. The layered construction could stop arrows and sword cuts, and the natural insulation properties made it practical for harsh climates where metal armor would be uncomfortable or impractical.
