## Description

A mask with a long 'beak' filled with herbal medicine that keeps infected pawns at a distance.

Based on plague doctor masks of the 17th century, though similar protective masks were used earlier during disease outbreaks. The distinctive long "beak" was filled with aromatic herbs, flowers, or other substances believed to protect against miasma (bad air) and disease. While medieval understanding of disease transmission was limited, the masks did provide some protection through filtration and helped maintain distance from infected patients. Plague masks became iconic symbols of medieval medicine and the struggle against epidemic disease, representing the best medical knowledge available at the time.
