# Acquired Traits

Some magical weapons are created by wizards, alchemists and other magical folk who spend years imparting magical energies into a sword or helmet. This is not the only way that a weapon or armour can become magical however.

A weapon or item of armour used by a Character for a long time and integral to great and heroic deeds can start to absorb some of the legend of their wielder or wearer and themselves become powerful. This accumulation of power is slow and uncertain and depends on the discretion of the Director. It can only apply to one item used by a Character, and the item must be used across one or more campaigns. An item can be magical at the start of this process, but cannot be an artefact.

If for example a Character uses a sword across a whole campaign, culminating in the slaying of a great and powerful Dragon, the Director may grant the sword a +1 bonus to attack with, increased to +2 to combat rolls and +1 to damage against Dragons. A shield used in a campaign focusing on combating an undead menace might provide a bonus of +1 to Armour rolls against any undead enemies. A staff used by a wizard in a campaign to defeat a Demon Lord might grant +1 to all casting rolls, and increase the damage of any spells cast against Demons by 1 STAMINA POINT.

It is possible for an item to accumulate more powers if the character continues to use the item. The Dragon Sword, used in a further campaign against a Chaos Warrior horde might also acquire the power of applying -1 to enemy armour rolls. An item used across multiple campaigns by the same Character could end up being very powerful indeed.

However, an item may only acquire power once at the culmination of a campaign (maybe even just as the final showdown begins) and a character may only have a single item that is acquiring powers this way.

Whilst the Character lives, this item will be intrinsically linked to the Character and any accumulated powers will manifest only when the item is used by its owner. Anyone else using the item will find it just a usual example of its kind.

Once the Character dies however, the powers in the item will become permanent and useable by anyone. If the Character dies in a specially heroic way, sacrificing themself to defeat some great enemy, the item will accumulate an extra power at that time.

The Director will be the sole arbiter of which powers are acquired and when, and also which item is the receptacle for the power. This system is designed to both encourage a player to build power rather than constantly looking to replace and upgrade their existing gear. It is also one way of a Character leaving a legacy on the world, an item to both recall their great deeds.
