# Military Aggression

A phaser cuts both ways, and those that excel in the arts of combat can choose to defend the Federation as great officers and captains or to use their skills for darker, more selfish purposes. These are warriors of some sort or another - renegade Star Fleet officers, Klingon warriors, pirates, or mercenaries.
