# Scientific/Technical Expertise

This domain encompasses villains who use advanced technology, scientific knowledge, or technical skills to achieve their goals. These could be rogue scientists, mad engineers, or researchers who have crossed ethical lines.

## Table 9.2.1A Scientific/Technical Expertise Type

Roll 1d6 to determine the specific type of scientific/technical villain:

| Roll 1d6 | Type | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Computer Specialist | Creator of rogue computers (M-5, Landru, Nomad), AI developers, systems programmers |
| 2 | Geneticist/Biologist | Augment creators, genetic engineers, life extension researchers, eugenicists |
| 3 | Engineer/Technician | Starship designers, weapons developers, experimental technology builders |
| 4 | Medical Researcher | Android creators, life support specialists, medical experimenters, organ harvesters |
| 5 | Psychologist/Mind Control Specialist | Mind control device creators, brainwashing researchers, telepathic technology developers |
| 6 | Energy/Physics Specialist | Antimatter researchers, dilithium experimenters, transporter technology developers, energy weapon creators |

In addition to technical ability, these villains have points in special skills from the Knowledge and Technical sections of the skills list.

## Characteristics and Skills

Those that rely on science and technology are often less physically capable than combat-focused villains, but they make up for it with knowledge and gadgets. They have SKILL = 3+1d3, STAMINA = 8+1d6 (engineers have 10+1d6) and MAGIC = 0 (no psionic abilities, but may have access to advanced technology). They have 3 points in the relevant Technical special skill (Engineering, Computers, etc.) and you will need to provide them with appropriate equipment and devices. They have 2 points in Technical special skills and most Knowledge special skills.

## Table 9.2.2 Scientific/Technical Expertise Motivations

| Roll 1d6 | Motivation |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Seeking forbidden or experimental technology to increase their power or knowledge |
| 2 | Exceptional arrogance or pride in their scientific ability - they know better than anyone |
| 3 | Hatred or rivalry with another scientist or organization |
| 4 | Insanity - their research has broken their mind and now they are dangerous |
| 5 | Commanded: Your villain is serving a more powerful master - perhaps a hostile power, a secret organization, or an alien entity |
| 6 | From another domain. Roll 1d6: |
| | 1-2: Ideological Fanaticism |
