# 9.2 Randomly Generated Villains - 1980s British Columbia

If you need to generate a random villain for your 1980s paranormal campaign, this section provides rules to create antagonists of your own. The tables below give you the framework to work with, but you'll need to add details to bring the villain to life.

In 1985, British Columbia is a place where the normal and the paranormal intersect. The province is home to UFO sightings, government conspiracies, corporate corruption, and strange phenomena that defy explanation. Villains in this era can be corrupt officials, cult leaders, mad scientists, corporate executives, or those who have been twisted by encounters with the unknown.

Villains are divided into four domains: 'Scientific/Technical Expertise', 'Ideological Fanaticism', 'Military Aggression', and 'Political Intrigue'. These correspond to different approaches to villainy in the 1980s paranormal setting, allowing for mixing and matching. For example, a corporate executive running experiments on unsuspecting subjects could be an intriguing adventure hook.

Each randomly generated villain has a motivation, characteristics, abilities, a base of operations, allies, a form of retaliation, and a battle tactic.

## Scientific/Technical Expertise

See [Scientific/Technical Expertise](Domains/Scientific-Technical-Expertise.md) for details on this domain.

## Ideological Fanaticism

See [Ideological Fanaticism](Domains/Ideological-Fanaticism.md) for details on this domain.

## Military Aggression

See [Military Aggression](Domains/Military-Aggression.md) for details on this domain.

## Political Intrigue

See [Political Intrigue](Domains/Political-Intrigue.md) for details on this domain.

## Equipment

Villain equipment should reflect their status, power, and background. It assumes villains have had time to acquire resources and that their equipment should reflect their "domain." Scientific villains should have advanced technology, experimental devices, or research equipment. Ideologically driven villains will be armed according to their beliefs and resources. If no information is given, villains should have appropriate armor (if any) and weapons. Militarily inclined villains should also have appropriate gear. "Professional" villains' equipment should reflect their trade (e.g., a spy with concealed weapons and surveillance devices, a corrupt official with superior weapons and access to government resources).

Look at pre-written villains in earlier parts of the chapter for equipment ideas.

## Base of Operations

A villain's base is their home, sanctum, treasure storage, and plotting ground. Either create an appropriate base or roll on the table below.

### Table 9.2.6 Villain's Base of Operations

| Roll 2d6 | Base of Operations |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | They have no fixed base and wander; their belongings carried in a vehicle from place to place |
| 3 | A laboratory or research facility with adjoining living quarters, the state of the facility depends on the owner |
| 4 | An abandoned building or derelict facility, depending on the villain they may have cleaned it up or not |
| 5 | A hidden base or secret facility, full of strange and dangerous technology or paranormal artifacts |
| 6 | Normal housing that looks unremarkable from the outside, but on the inside has been decorated and altered to reflect the owners 'passions' (scientific equipment for a researcher, weapons and trophies for a warrior and so on) |
| 7 | An underground complex or hidden facility, its state and decoration reflect the owners needs and tastes |
| 8 | A remote location such as a cabin in the woods or isolated compound which the villain has occupied and fortified |
| 9 | An abandoned facility or derelict building (if the villain is a cultist or ideologue, it will have been converted to serve their cause) |
| 10 | A mobile base such as a modified RV or van, complete with all necessary facilities, moved around as required |
| 11 | A corporate or government facility fitted out with luxurious quarters and facilities dedicated to the villains' pursuits |
| 12 | A hidden dimension or pocket of reality, a little bubble of space that is somehow connected to your villain. When they die, it disappears! (the hero has just enough time to grab important items and leap to safety) |

## Allies

A good villain needs allies to assist them in their schemes. These are not simply cannon fodder but trusted members of your opponents team.

### Table 9.2.7 Villain's Allies

| Roll 2d6 | Allies - they fight to the death unless stated otherwise |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | They have no allies; if you succeed in a mission you always get to fight them! |
| 3 | **Mind-Controlled Agent**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 8, Weapon: Handgun, Armour: Light<br>An agent has been mentally controlled or brainwashed to serve as an ally. They may snap out of it when severely wounded - when reduced to 3 STAMINA or less make a 1d6 roll - on a 1 or 2 the control lifts and they will fall to their knees and surrender. You may spare them if you wish. |
| 4 | **Alien or Paranormal Entity**<br>SKILL: 5, STAMINA: 8, Weapon: Natural Weapons or Energy Weapon, Armour: Medium<br>Somehow, your opponent has obtained the services of an alien entity or paranormal being to serve as their ally. These entities may have strange abilities or weaknesses. |
| 5 | **Paranormal Creature**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 8, Weapons: Natural Weapons, Armour: Light<br>A paranormal creature's attack is dangerous - if the creature hits you four times in combat you are incapacitated and your fate is sealed. |
| 6 | **Mercenary**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 9, Weapon: Assault Rifle or Handgun, Armour: Light<br>Make an Awareness test on the first round to spot them as they spring from concealment. If you fail, they get +4 to the combat roll for that round. |
| 7 | **Hired Thug**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 9, Weapon: Handgun or Melee Weapon, Armour: Medium<br>The thug has been paid to fight, but not to die - when reduced to 2 STAMINA or less they will surrender. |
| 8 | **Corrupt Officer**<br>SKILL: 5, STAMINA: 11, Weapon: Service Weapon or Assault Rifle, Armour: Medium<br>They have superior weapons that will inflict one point of additional STAMINA damage when they hit, which is not prevented by armour. If you defeat them you can recover their weapon. |
| 9 | **Renegade Agent**<br>SKILL: 4, STAMINA: 8, MAGIC: 0, Weapon: Handgun, Armour: Light<br>They will fight using non-lethal methods in the first round and then lethal force after which they will fight hand-to-hand. They are ultimately cowards - if reduced to STAMINA of 2 or less they will surrender. In tears. It's up to you what you do about that. |
| 10 | **Fanatic**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 8, Weapon: Handgun or Melee Weapon (+1 damage), Armour: Light<br>The Fanatic has no special powers but is fanatically loyal to their master; they will fight to the death. |
| 11 | **Elite Enforcer**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 9, Armour: Medium, Weapon: Advanced Weapon<br>The Elite Enforcers are tough and fearless fighters who have no fear of death. Even when reduced to zero STAMINA they will continue to fight for one round in a show of heroic loyalty. |
| 12 | Roll twice on this table and when you encounter allies, you encounter both - good luck! |

## Retaliation

Once you have completed your first mission against this opponent they will be aware of your presence and may try to stop you pursuing them. After the first mission and until you defeat them, roll to see what type of retaliation they send against you.

### Table 9.2.8 Villain's Retaliation

| Roll 2d6 | Retaliation |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | Your opponent is extremely upset with your meddling - roll twice on this table and apply both effects! |
| 3 | **Remote-Controlled Device:** A remote-controlled weapon or device appears daily (1-2: morning, 3-4: midday, 5-6: evening) with SKILL 8, doing damage as a normal weapon, and the device being destroyed if it loses a combat round |
| 4 | **Biological Weapon:** The opponent has infected the player with a disease or toxin. On a 1d6 roll of one each day, the player suffers effects determined by Table 4.3.2 Diseases and can be cured normally with medical treatment |
| 5 | **Turned Agent:** On a social encounter, a 1d6 roll of one means the encountered individual has been 'turned' by the enemy and will attack, without resulting in a Lawbreaker table roll |
| 6 | **Saboteur:** The villain has hired saboteurs to track and fight the player. A Saboteur (encounter C10 equivalent) will appear alongside the enemy in the first fight of the day during a challenge encounter or combat |
| 7 | **Assassin:** An assassin hired by the opponent. On a daily 1d6 roll of one, an assassin attacks (1-2: morning, 3-4: midday, 5-6: evening). The assassin has SKILL 6, STAMINA 9, uses a Handgun or Rifle, has Armour: 3 points of Dodge skill. The player must make an Awareness test with a -3 penalty at the start of combat; if failed, the assassin gains +6 to her combat roll and +2 to her damage roll on the first round |
| 8 | **Traps:** The opponent has employed a saboteur to set traps. When moving to a new location, area, or facility section, a 1d6 roll of one means the player stumbles into a trap, which is then determined by Table 4.4.2 Traps |
| 9 | **Clones or Doppelgangers:** Upon defeating an enemy, a 1d6 roll of one causes a clone or doppelganger version to appear, attacking again. The duplicate version has its SKILL and STAMINA reduced by two compared to the real version, with no limit on daily occurrences. Unnerving! |
| 10 | **Swarm:** Biting or stinging creatures sent to plague the player. Before any fight, a 1d6 roll of one means something is attacking, causing -1 to skill tests for that combat, unless two rounds are spent finding and eliminating it |
| 11 | **Resurrection Technology:** Identical to Roll 9 (Clones or Doppelgangers), stating that upon defeating an enemy, a 1d6 roll of one causes a duplicate version to appear, attacking again. The duplicate version has its SKILL and STAMINA reduced by two compared to the real version, with no limit on daily occurrences. Unnerving! |
| 12 | Your enemy is focusing on their plans and fails to send any retaliation your way. Fortunate! |

## Confrontation / Battle Tactic

While the hero might fight to the death, the opponent will have a battle tactic to win or escape to continue their evil doing.

### Table 9.2.9 Villain's Battle Tactic

| Roll 2d6 | Battle Tactic |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | **No tactics, just glory!** The villain fights to the death with no special plans |
| 3 | **Escape vehicle:** The villain attempts to defeat the hero but also has other commitments. Each round, on a roll of 1 on 1d6, they use a vehicle or escape route (-6 to combat rolls for one round) and flee |
| 4 | **Defensive fighter:** Each round, on a 1 or 2 on 1d6, the villain takes a 'defensive' combat option (+2 to combat roll, no damage). The fourth time they do this, they feint and flee |
| 5 | **Summon creatures:** Every time the villain is wounded, they summon paranormal creatures or automated defenses to attack the hero for 1 STAMINA damage (no Dodge or Armour applies) |
| 6 | **Weapon overload:** At the start of combat, roll 2d6. After that many rounds, the opponent uses an overloaded weapon or explosive to stun the hero. The hero must test LUCK or be stunned, allowing the villain to flee |
| 7 | **Bodyguard:** The villain has a bodyguard (SKILL 6, STAMINA 9, Weapon: Handgun or Assault Rifle, Armour: Light). If the hero fails to defeat the bodyguard within five rounds, the opponent flees. The villain takes a week to find a replacement |
| 8 | **Holographic images or illusions:** The villain has a device that creates two illusions or holographic images. To spot the actual villain, the hero must pass an Awareness skill test; otherwise, they attack an image. The images last eight rounds, after which the villain attempts to flee. The device has two charges |
| 9 | **Mind control:** The villain tries to entrance the hero and convince them to leave. The hero must test against their SKILL or LUCK (choice) or be ensnared by psionics or technology and let them flee. This test occurs at the start of combat and every third round thereafter. The hero gains a +2 bonus to their tests each time they fight them (+2 on the second time, +4 on the next, and so on) |
| 10 | **Medical device:** When reduced to 4 STAMINA or less, the villain uses a medical device or stimulant to restore health. If not defeated, it takes them a week to acquire a new one |
| 11 | **Resurrection technology:** The villain fights to the death because they have a second chance. Once killed, they return as a clone or doppelganger (SKILL -1, STAMINA -2). The next time they are killed, it's permanent |
| 12 | **Well prepared:** The opponent has ensured their survival; roll twice on this table and apply both battle tactics |

## Example of a Randomly Created Villain

The process involves rolling dice and allowing a picture to emerge, with the flexibility to change results to fit the campaign or setting.

**Type:** Ideological Fanaticism, determined by a roll of 2 on Table 9.2.1 'Villain Domain'. This type includes cult leaders, UFO believers, religious extremists, and fanatics.

**Location:** The villain's starting location is a Rural/Remote Area, determined by a roll of 3. This is just a starting point and the adventure could begin elsewhere.

**Background:** The villain is from an Independent/Cult background, determined by a roll of 6. This fits well with the Ideological Fanaticism domain.

**Characteristics and Skills:** The example villain's abilities. They have a SKILL of 6 (rolled 1d3+4) and a STAMINA of 13 (rolled 1d6+10), making them moderately tough. The villain also possesses special skills: 2 points in Knowledge, 2 points in Armour (if they wear any), and one type of hand weapon (handgun, melee weapon, etc.). A SKILL of 6 combined with 2 points in a weapon skill makes for a dangerous opponent, while 2 points in Armour provide decent level of protection.
