# Military Aggression

A weapon cuts both ways, and those that excel in the arts of combat can choose to defend the innocent as police officers and soldiers or to use their skills for darker, more selfish purposes. These are warriors of some sort or another - renegade officers, violent criminals, mercenaries, or thugs.

You should define their specific details, such as "heavily armed enforcer with assault rifles and body armor or lightly equipped assassin with a silenced pistol and knife?" Almost every type of fighter can provide a challenging foe.
