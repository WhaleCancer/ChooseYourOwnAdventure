# Scientific/Technical Expertise

This domain encompasses villains who use advanced technology, scientific knowledge, or technical skills to achieve their goals. These could be rogue scientists, mad researchers, or corporate technicians who have crossed ethical lines in pursuit of knowledge or profit.

Roll 1d6 to determine the general approach: 1-2: Researcher (academic, scientist, medical professional), 3-4: Engineer/Technician (practical application, building devices), 5-6: Other or roll again (paranormal researcher, hacker, etc.).

## Table 9.2.1A Scientific/Technical Expertise Type

Roll 1d6 to determine the specific type of scientific/technical villain:

| Roll 1d6 | Type | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Computer Specialist | AI developers, systems programmers, hackers who have gone rogue, creators of experimental computer systems |
| 2 | Geneticist/Biologist | Genetic engineers, eugenicists, researchers experimenting on humans or animals, bioweapon developers |
| 3 | Engineer/Technician | Weapons developers, experimental technology builders, those creating devices that shouldn't exist |
| 4 | Medical Researcher | Human experimenters, organ harvesters, those testing on unwilling subjects, life extension researchers |
| 5 | Psychologist/Mind Control Specialist | Brainwashing researchers, mind control device creators, those experimenting with psychic powers or manipulation |
| 6 | Paranormal Researcher | Those studying UFOs, psychic phenomena, or other paranormal events through unethical means, often with government or corporate backing |

## Table 9.2.1B Scientific/Technical Expertise Type by Background

When a villain has the Scientific/Technical Expertise domain, roll on this table based on their background to determine their specific type:

In addition to technical ability, these villains have points in special skills from the Knowledge and Technical sections of the skills list.

## Characteristics and Skills

Those that rely on science and technology are often less physically capable than combat-focused villains, but they make up for it with knowledge and gadgets. They have SKILL = 3+1d3, STAMINA = 8+1d6 (engineers have 10+1d6) and MAGIC = 0 (no psionic abilities, but may have access to advanced technology or paranormal artifacts). They have 3 points in the relevant Technical special skill (Engineering, Computers, Medicine, etc.) and you will need to provide them with appropriate equipment and devices. They have 2 points in Technical special skills and most Knowledge special skills.
