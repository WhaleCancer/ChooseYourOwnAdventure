# 9.2 Randomly Generated Villains

If, for some unfathomable reason, you are not satisfied with the villains provided this section provides you with some rules to generate a random villain of your own. Of course, a lot of detail will have to be provided by you but we will give you the bare bones to work with.

Villains are divided into four domains: magic users, priests, 'warriors', and 'power seekers'. These map to 'Winds of Magic', 'Fury of the Gods', 'Chaos Unleashed', and 'Lust for Power' for longer missions. This classification follows both AFF rules and common fantasy villain archetypes, allowing for mixing and matching. For example, an orc warlord seeking magical knowledge could be an intriguing adventure hook.

Each randomly generated villain has a motivation, characteristics, abilities, a lair, henchmen, a form of retaliation, and a battle tactic.

## Table 9.2.1 Villain Domain

Roll 1d6 (reroll 5-6)

| Roll 1d6 | Domain | Typical Villains |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Winds of Magic | Wizards, sorcerers and other MAGIC based traditions |
| 2 | Fury of the Gods | Priests and devout followers of a particular religion such as paladins or zealots |
| 3 | Chaos Unleashed | Warlords, barbarians and monsters - those who fight! |
| 4 | Lust for Power | Merchants, thieves and nobles conducting deadly intrigues |

## Location

Roll on 1d6 to determine the villain's starting operating location. Note that villains can move.

| Roll 1d6 | Location |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-2 | City |
| 3-4 | Wilderness |
| 5-6 | Dungeon |

## Race

Humans are common on Titan. Roll on 1d6 to determine the villain's race. Consider how race affects encounters (e.g., elves and dwarves with darkvision fighting at night, an undead villain's housing).

| Roll 1d6 | Race |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1-2 | Human |
| 3 | Dwarf |
| 4 | Elf |
| 5-6 | Other - roll again on 1d6: |
| | 1: Orc |
| | 2: Goblin |
| | 3: Lizardman |
| | 4: Demon |
| | 5: Undead |
| | 6: Director's choice |

## Winds of Magic

See [Winds of Magic](Domains/Winds-of-Magic.md) for details on this domain.

## Fury of the Gods

See [Fury of the Gods](Domains/Fury-of-the-Gods.md) for details on this domain.

## Chaos Unleashed

See [Chaos Unleashed](Domains/Chaos-Unleashed.md) for details on this domain.

## Lust for Power

See [Lust for Power](Domains/Lust-for-Power.md) for details on this domain.

## Equipment

Villain equipment should reflect their status and power. It assumes villains have had time to acquire gold and that their equipment should reflect their "domain." Magic-using villains should have robes, staff/dagger for wizards; armor, melee weapon for sorcerers. Religiously inclined villains will be armed and armoured according to the edicts of their gods. If no information is given, villains should have appropriate armor, shields, and weapons. Martially inclined villains should also have appropriate gear. "Professional" villains' equipment should reflect their trade (e.g., a master thief with poisoned daggers, a merchant with superior weapons and armor).

Look at pre-written villains in earlier parts of the chapter for equipment ideas.

## Lair

A villain's lair is their home, sanctum, treasure storage, and plotting ground. Either create an appropriate lair or roll on the table below.

### Table 9.2.6 Villains Lair

| Roll 2d6 | Lair |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | They have no lair and wander; their belongings carried by porters from place to place |
| 3 | A library or laboratory with adjoining living quarters, the state of the library depends on the owner |
| 4 | An ancient crypt or tomb, depending on the villain they may have cleaned it up or not |
| 5 | A tower, full of strange and dangerous objects |
| 6 | Normal housing that looks unremarkable from the outside, but on the inside has been decorated and altered to reflect the owners 'passions' (arcane symbols for a wizard, weapons and skulls for a warlord and so on) |
| 7 | An underground complex, its state and decoration reflect the owners needs and tastes |
| 8 | A natural feature such as a cavern or glade which the villain has occupied and fortified |
| 9 | An abandoned temple (if the villain is a priest or cultist, it will have been re-dedicated to the worship of their god) |
| 10 | A large tent or yurt, complete with rugs, tapestries and an ornate stove, moved around on a set of wagons when required |
| 11 | A ship or barge fitted out with luxurious cabins and a whole deck dedicated to the villains' pursuits |
| 12 | A small magical realm, a little bubble of reality that is somehow connected to your villain. When they die, it disappears! (the hero has just enough time to grab the treasure and leap to safety) |

## Henchman

A good villain needs a right hand man or woman to assist them in their carnage. These are not simply cannon fodder but trusted members of your opponents team.

### Table 9.2.7 Villain's Henchman

| Roll 2d6 | Henchman - they fight to the death unless stated otherwise |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | They have no henchman; if you succeed in a mission you always get to fight them! |
| 3 | **Entranced Man**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 8, Weapon: Two Handed Axe, Armour: Leather Cuirass<br>A young man has been magically entranced to serve as a henchman. They may snap out of it when severely wounded - when reduced to 3 STAMINA or less make a 1d6 roll - on a 1 or 2 the enchantment lifts and they will fall to their knees and surrender. You may spare them if you wish. |
| 4 | **Tree Man**<br>SKILL: 5, STAMINA: 8, Weapon: Branch x2, treat as Clubs, Armour: Heavy<br>Somehow, your opponent has obtained the services of some Tree Men to serve as their henchmen. These tough plants take double damage from fire based attacks. |
| 5 | **Ghoul**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 8, Weapons: Medium Claw, Armour: Light<br>A Ghoul's touch is paralysing - if the Ghoul hits you four times in combat you are paralysed and your fate is sealed. |
| 6 | **Thug**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 9, Weapon: Sword, Armour: Leather Hauberk and Small Shield<br>Make an Awareness test on the first round to spot them as they spring from the shadows. If you fail, they get +4 to the combat roll for that round. |
| 7 | **Mercenary**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 9, Weapon: Sword, Armour: Chain Cuirass and Small Shield<br>The mercenary has been paid to fight, but not to die - when reduced to 2 STAMINA or less they will surrender. |
| 8 | **Lizardman**<br>SKILL: 5, STAMINA: 11, Weapon: Spear, Armour: Medium<br>They have poison coated weapons that will inflict one point of STAMINA damage when they hit, which is not prevented by armour. If you defeat him you can recover a vial of this poison - there is enough to coat a weapon for one combat or 10 arrows. The poison has no effect on Lizardmen. |
| 9 | **Apprentice**<br>SKILL: 4, STAMINA: 8, MAGIC: 3 (Arcane Power 5), Weapon: Staff, Armour: None (Dodge skill 2)<br>They will fight using the spells 'Weakness' in the first round and then 'Flash!' after which they will use their staves and fight hand-to-hand. They are ultimately cowards - if reduced to STAMINA of 2 or less they will surrender. In tears. It's up to you what you do about that. |
| 10 | **Cultist**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 8, Weapon: Mace (+1 damage), Armour: Leather Cuirass<br>The Cultist has no priestly powers but is fanatically loyal to their master; they will fight to the death. |
| 11 | **Doragar**<br>SKILL: 6, STAMINA: 9, Armour: Medium, Weapon: 2-Handed Sword<br>The Doragar are tough and fearless warriors who have no fear of death. Even when reduced to zero STAMINA they will continue to fight for one round in a show of heroic loyalty. |
| 12 | Roll twice on this table and when you encounter a henchman, you encounter both - good luck! |

## Retaliation

Once you have completed your first mission against this opponent they will be aware of your presence and may try to stop you pursuing them. After the first mission and until you defeat them, roll to see what type of retaliation they send against you.

### Table 9.2.8 Villain's Retaliation

| Roll 2d6 | Retaliation |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | Your opponent is extremely upset with your meddling - roll twice on this table and apply both effects! |
| 3 | **Animated Club:** An animated club appears daily (1-2: morning, 3-4: midday, 5-6: evening) with SKILL 8, doing damage as a normal club, and the spell ending if it loses a combat round |
| 4 | **Curse of plagues:** The opponent has cursed the player, causing a disease on a 1d6 roll of one, which is determined by Table 4.3.2 Diseases and can be cured normally |
| 5 | **Traitors:** On a social encounter, a 1d6 roll of one means the encountered individual has been 'turned' by the enemy and will attack, without resulting in a Lawbreaker table roll |
| 6 | **Goblin Infiltrator:** The villain has hired goblins to track and fight the player. A Goblin Infiltrator (encounter C10) will appear alongside the enemy in the first fight of the day during a challenge encounter or combat |
| 7 | **Assassin:** An assassin hired by the opponent. On a daily 1d6 roll of one, an assassin attacks (1-2: morning, 3-4: midday, 5-6: evening). The assassin has SKILL 6, STAMINA 9, uses a Short Sword, has Armour: 3 points of Dodge skill. The player must make an Awareness test with a -3 penalty at the start of combat; if failed, the assassin gains +6 to her combat roll and +2 to her damage roll on the first round |
| 8 | **Traps:** The opponent has employed a rogue to set traps. When moving to a new location, area, or dungeon section, a 1d6 roll of one means the player stumbles into a trap, which is then determined by Table 4.4.2 Traps |
| 9 | **Zombie:** Upon defeating an enemy, a 1d6 roll of one causes it to return as a zombie version of itself, attacking again. The zombie version has its SKILL and STAMINA reduced by two compared to the real version, with no limit on daily occurrences. Unnerving! |
| 10 | **Swarm:** Biting insects sent to plague the player. Before any fight, a 1d6 roll of one means something is gnawing, causing -1 to skill tests for that combat, unless two rounds are spent finding and squashing it |
| 11 | **Undeath:** Identical to Roll 9 (Zombie), stating that upon defeating an enemy, a 1d6 roll of one causes it to return as a zombie version of itself, attacking again. The zombie version has its SKILL and STAMINA reduced by two compared to the real version, with no limit on daily occurrences. Unnerving! |
| 12 | Your enemy is focusing on their plans and fails to send any retaliation your way. Fortunate! |

## Confrontation / Battle Tactic

While the hero might fight to the death, the opponent will have a battle tactic to win or escape to continue their evil doing.

### Table 9.2.9 Villain's Battle Tactic

| Roll 2d6 | Battle Tactic |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | **No tactics, just glory!** The villain fights to the death with no special plans |
| 3 | **Vanishing act:** The villain attempts to defeat the hero but also has other commitments. Each round, on a roll of 1 on 1d6, they distract with a smoke bomb (-6 to combat rolls for one round) and flee |
| 4 | **Wary fighter:** Each round, on a 1 or 2 on 1d6, the villain takes a 'defensive' combat option (+2 to combat roll, no damage). The fourth time they do this, they feint and flee |
| 5 | **Swarms:** Every time the villain is wounded, they summon a swarm of rats or scorpions to bite the hero for 1 STAMINA damage (no Dodge or Armour applies) |
| 6 | **Thunderbolt:** At the start of combat, roll 2d6. After that many rounds, the opponent calls upon a dark power to smite the hero. The hero must test LUCK or be stunned, allowing the villain to flee |
| 7 | **Bodyguard:** The villain has a bodyguard (SKILL 6, STAMINA 9, Weapon: Mace, Armour: Leather Hauberk). If the hero fails to defeat the bodyguard within five rounds, the opponent flees. The villain takes a week to find a replacement |
| 8 | **Mirror Images:** The villain has an item that creates two illusory images. To spot the actual villain, the hero must pass an Awareness skill test; otherwise, they attack an image. The images last eight rounds, after which the villain attempts to flee. The item has two charges |
| 9 | **Hypnotic Stare:** The villain tries to entrance the hero and convince them to leave. The hero must test against their SKILL or LUCK (choice) or be ensnared by charisma and let them flee. This test occurs at the start of combat and every third round thereafter. The hero gains a +2 bonus to their tests each time they fight them (+2 on the second time, +4 on the next, and so on) |
| 10 | **Potion of STAMINA:** When reduced to 4 STAMINA or less, the villain drinks a STAMINA potion to restore health. If not defeated, it takes them a week to purchase a new one |
| 11 | **Resurrection:** The villain fights to the death because they have a second chance. Once killed, they return as a revenant (SKILL -1, STAMINA -2, MAGIC -1). The next time they are killed, it's permanent |
| 12 | **Well prepared:** The opponent has ensured their survival; roll twice on this table and apply both battle tactics |

## Example of a Randomly Created Villain

The process involves rolling dice and allowing a picture to emerge, with the flexibility to change results to fit the campaign or setting.

**Type:** Chaos Unleashed, determined by a roll of 3 on Table 9.2.1 'Villain Domain'. This type includes warlords, monsters, and those who fight through force of arms.

**Location:** The villain's starting location is the wilderness, determined by a roll of 3. This is just a starting point and the adventure could begin elsewhere, like a city or dungeon.

**Race:** The villain is a human, determined by a roll of 2. This is a common outcome, as villains exist across all groups, but humans are generally more numerous.

**Characteristics and Skills:** The example villain's combat prowess. They have a SKILL of 7 (rolled 1d3+5) and a STAMINA of 18 (rolled 1d6+12), making them very tough. The villain also possesses special skills: 2 points in Movement, 3 points in Armour, 1 type of hand weapon (e.g., swords, axes), and 2 points in another two weapon types. A SKILL of 7 combined with 3 points in a weapon skill makes for a dangerous hand-to-hand opponent, while 3 points in Armour provide decent level of protection.
