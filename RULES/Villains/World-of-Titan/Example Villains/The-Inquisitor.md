# The Inquisitor - Anna Gotval

## Description

At a late hour, a chapel is mostly in darkness, illuminated by a few torches and altar candles providing flickering, uncertain light. Anna Gotval experiences a thrilling shiver of fear as she approaches the altar.

The altar is a hideous thing; a rough stone basin, stained with dried blood, protruded from the base of a carving of her dark master. The carving of the dark master is detailed: four arms ending in clawed hands spread out from a trunk composed of bodies melded together in torment. Two muscular legs bunched up under the torso ended with cylindrical elephantine feet. At the top a great rough head leered at her, with 4 great horns bending and twisting above it.

As Gotval reaches the dias, she first kneels and then prostrated herself full-length on the floor in front of the monstrosity. Her acolytes begin a low moaning chant, which she had trained them to do. Breaking their will had been a pleasure.

Anna Gotval reaches out with her mind to contact her master, experiencing a brief flash of memory of her father, who built the chapel to worship a nature god. This memory is dismissed coldly as her master was not one for sentimentality. She opens her mind and soul to await instruction, as infernal plans flood her consciousness, causing an almost unbearable assault and leaving her twisting in pain on the floor as the acolytes' chanting reaches a rage filled crescendo. She grasped the plan and broke the contact, unable to bear anymore. Shivering and exhausted, she hunches into a ball, then forces herself to stand and address the now silent congregation. She states: "Our Master has shown me the way. Go and rest now, for tomorrow we have work to do." Gotval then strode back down the aisle, with the clack-clack of her boots being the only sound in this unholy place.

## Motivation

The Inquisitor's overarching goal is conducting a religious war against all unbelievers. She is merciless and determined, sending out agents to recruit cultists to aid her or to weaken and demoralise the world until there are none strong enough to stand in her way. If you fail to defeat her in the first mission, roll next from the following categories.

## Lair

**City:** The Inquisitor has secured a small house or set of rooms which, helped by her cultists, she has made into a secret chapel dedicated to her devilish masters. From the outside it looks normal but on the inside the walls have been daubed with hellish symbols, filled with stinking incense, and draped with dark cloths over walls and broken windows.

**Dungeon:** A room or set of rooms at the center of which is a shrine to evil gods, adorned with carvings. A candlelit altar is present for rituals and sacrifices, with tools stored nearby.

**Wilderness:** An abandoned temple or shrine, desecrated and converted to serve ruinous powers. The main chamber may be underground, and the structure is decorated with tattered bits of cloth painted with religious symbols and rotting remains of sacrifices.

## Confrontation

**Inquisitor:**
- **SKILL:** 7
- **STAMINA:** 12
- **Devotion:** 5
- **Weapons:** Mace (Demonfist)
- **Armour:** Chainmail Cuirass + Small Shield

The Inquisitor will fight toe-to-toe and use the priestly power 'Ill Luck' in the first round of combat.

**Demon Transformation:** If her STAMINA is reduced to 4 or less, she calls upon dark powers to transform into a winged demon. This transformation instantly heals her 5 STAMINA, changes her skin to dark blood red, gives her sharpened fangs, and causes two huge wings to sprout from her back. In her winged demon form, she gains the priestly power 'Smite' (instant, no casting round). She attempts to escape by winning two successive rounds of combat, then leaps into the skies on her second round (this replaces dealing damage), requiring the Hero to track her down again. The transformation is permanent, and the next fight with her is to the death.

**Demon Form Stats:** SKILL 8, STAMINA 9, no Devotion, but permanently has the power 'Smite'.

## Item

**Demonfist:** The Inquisitor's mace, made of black iron with the end shaped like a clenched fist. It is a magical weapon that adds +1 to the damage roll when hitting.

## Henchman

**Frenzied Cultist:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 9
- **Weapon:** Mace
- **Armour:** Leather Cuirass + Small Shield

The cultists are fanatical, willing to die for the Inquisitor, fighting wildly, increasing damage by one point when they strike, and hurling curses and insults at the hero.

## Retaliation

The Inquisitor actively converts people to her cause. If the hero is deemed a threat, they are marked for death. While tracking the Inquisitor, any social encounter requires a 1d6 roll; a result of 1 means the person is a cult member and will attack (using Frenzied Cultist details). This specific event does not trigger a roll on the Lawbreaker table.
