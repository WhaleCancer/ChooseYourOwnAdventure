# The Nest Mother

## Description

Ratmen are a constant menace across Titan and sometimes a powerful leader arises to lead them. The only way to stop the attacks is to defeat the Nest Mother and let the ratmen go back to fighting each other. Their numbers are too great to deal with otherwise.

Deep beneath the cities of Titan, in the forgotten crypts and clogged sewers, the ratmen live out their frantic lives in the darkness with clan battling clan in wars that pass largely unnoticed on the surface.

From time to time, however, a powerful matriarch emerges from this chaos and takes command of a large number of ratmen. This is the time of danger for humans, dwarves and elves as she will use her power to organise raids on the surface - not just hunts for food and weapons, but also sending out sappers to gnaw and scrabble at the foundations of the surface world.

## Motivation

The nest mother's motivation is primal - to increase and protect her nest, with its warren of tunnels and myriad squeaking inhabitants. To that end she will pursue whatever opportunities are available. She is intelligent, but not wise enough to set a long term strategy. The nest mother is capable of acquiring human allies, usually through bribery, and setting them to work for her.

Many cities have been alerted to the rise of a nest mother only when a part of their settlement collapsed overnight into artificial sink-holes. On top of the normal fear of these night stalkers, the ratmen carry with them the miasma of the crypts they inhabit - deadly chaos tainted diseases act like a second army supporting their attacks.

## Lair

**City:** The true lair of the Nest Mother lies deep in the earth, in the maze-like tunnels of her clan's burrow, but in order to carry out attacks on the surface dwellers she has chosen a small camp near to the surface. Connected to an unused sewer or abandoned cellar, this filthy room is filled with rats and bones, with tunnels large enough for ratmen.

**Dungeon:** Ratmen adapt dungeons and city ruins by building narrow tunnels and nest-like structures.

**Wilderness:** Ratmen's wilderness habitats, often near human civilization, using natural features like caves as flea-ridden lairs, with evidence of half-eaten animals.

## Confrontation

**Nest Mother:**
- **SKILL:** 7
- **STAMINA:** 12
- **Armour:** Monster Medium
- **Weapons:** Large Bite, Medium Claw (one attack with each)

Consort of The Rat-King, the Nest Mother is a monstrous Ratman possessed of unusual cunning. Dressed in patchwerk leather robes (made from the hides of her vanquished enemies) and standing eight feet tall when on her hind legs, she has the strength to bind the clans together under her command.

When wounded, she summons a swarm of rats, imposing a -1 penalty to combat rolls and requiring a 1d6 roll. On a roll of 1, she escapes, requiring tracking.

She is foul and putrid. After fighting her, the player must test LUCK or contract a disease (referencing Table 4.3.2 Diseases).

## Item

**Orb of Shadows:** She carries a glassy orb filled with swirling shadows, apple-sized, which grants +2 to Sneaking tests for 10 minutes once a day.

## Hench(rat)men

**Ratmen Assassin:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 8
- **Weapon:** Sword
- **Armour:** Leather Cuirass

Ratmen assassins are very stealthy. Make an Awareness skill roll when you come near them, or they will make their first attack from concealment gaining a +4 bonus on their combat rolls.

## Retaliation

**Plague Bearer:** The Nest Mother can summon a disease-riddled rat. At the start of each day, a 1d6 roll (on a 1, the rat finds you) requires a LUCK test or contracting a disease (referencing Table 4.3.2 Diseases).
