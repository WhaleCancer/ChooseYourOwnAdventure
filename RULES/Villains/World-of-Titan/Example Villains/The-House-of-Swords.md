# The House of Swords

## Description

The House of Swords is a faction of nobles in Titan who engage in decadent pursuits like duels, espionage, sabotage, and general mischief. They operate under a code of conduct called 'the House of Swords' to prevent full-scale war. While senior nobles are protected, peasants often suffer from their machinations, becoming "pawns in the game."

In a duel, Rollo, wounded, asks Azar if he can yield. Azar's sponsor, the Count, nods, implying Rollo's fate is sealed. Azar feigns a final thrust, allowing Rollo to recover and fatally stab Azar with a hidden dagger. Azar dies, and the onlookers gasp before applauding Rollo's victory. Servants rush to aid Rollo, and some congratulate him.

## Motivation

Count Montagu de Hood is arrogant and cruel and intends to beat his rivals and raise his status by whatever means available.

## Lair

**City:** The House of Swords have comfortable lives spent in the finest houses in the land and they have no intention of giving up these privileges even when trying to destroy the city around it. It will, however, be a property that has been rented under a false name or occupied without the true owner's knowledge, appearing as a grand dwelling.

**Dungeon:** A dungeon is an unlikely spot for the House of Swords, but if necessary, it will be partitioned and cleaned up. It mentions tapestries, torches in sconces, a fireplace, a well-stocked larder, and a secret passage connecting to a guard's room where help can be summoned via a bell or gong.

**Wilderness:** Most nobles have country places, and the House of Swords has options in this regard. They avoid operating criminal enterprises from their main residence, instead using a decent manor house, likely stripped back to essentials and guarded by groundsmen under strict instruction to deter investigators.

## Confrontation

**Count Montagu de Hood:**
- **SKILL:** 9
- **STAMINA:** 13
- **Weapon:** Sword
- **Armour:** Dodge Special skill of 4

Count Montagu de Hood is tall and slender, with a dancer's build, an excellent duellist in his youth. He now seeks to replace the excitement of hand-to-hand combat with manipulating groups of nobles. He is not afraid of "getting his hands dirty" but prefers to manipulate others, especially young nobles seeking to make a name for themselves. He is corrupt and greedy but of noble rank.

If he is injured below 8 STAMINA, he cries "Guards! Guards!" and calls for the Watch. A 1d6 roll (1, 2, or 3) indicates that Watchmen are nearby and will burst in, bundling the player to the ground and stopping attacks. The Count will escape, and the player must track him down, though the player can reduce his SKILL by one each time they face him. If guards aid the Count, the player can attempt to convince them of his guilt by rolling against their Law skill; if successful, the guards will not help him again in the future.

## Item

**The Count's Signet Ring:** A heavy gold ring enchanted to sharpen the wearer's wits, granting +1 to tests of their Law skill if worn.

## Henchman

**Dandy Duelist:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 9
- **Weapon:** Sword
- **Armour:** Dodge skill 3

The Dandy Duelist is a young noble, eager for glory, recruited by the Count. He is arrogant, brash, and convinced of his "own natural superiority," ending with the phrase "En garde!"

## Retaliation

The Count is annoyed by interference and has bribed the Watch to pursue the player. Every day in the settlement where the encounter occurred, the player must roll against their Law skill with a +3 bonus. If the roll fails, the first encounter of the day will be with corrupt Watchmen, requiring a roll on the Lawbreaker table, with a minimum result of six (implying the Watch has limits).
