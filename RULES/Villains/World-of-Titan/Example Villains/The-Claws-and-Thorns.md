# The Claws & Thorns

## Description

The Claws & Thorns is a loose congregation of druids, rangers, barbarians and wild folk that abhor the destruction of nature that is brought about by the cities and towns of Titan. Often led by elves that were guardians of the wilds before the humans arrived.

Lortel the Swift stood atop the high stone bluff and looked eastward, across farmland, to the city bathed in the golden light of an autumn sunset. He observed a human settlement, his disgust at its expansion, and his subsequent address to his companions, recalling how humans were initially welcomed but then broke their promises. The excerpt ends with Lortel's rallying cry: "and in time forgot the promises they made. But we did not forget. They have grown too much, destroyed too much. Every year they take more and more, with no end in sight. My friends, the time has come for us to fight back. The city is strong, but the wilds are stronger!"

## Motivation

The Claws & Thorns strike at cities in an attempt to hold back the tide of civilization and preserve the wilderness. They do not think of themselves as evil - far from it, they regard most humans as careless and see what they do as a necessary, if regrettable, act of population control. Frequently they are worshippers of the Beast Lords and the other neutral gods such as Aqualis and Sukh.

### Claws & Thorns Mission Generator - Refer to Table 10.1.1 Campaign Missions

| Roll | Secret Scheme | Roll on the mission table under.. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-4 | The city itself is an affront to nature and a wound upon her body; it must be weakened or destroyed to preserve the balance | Fury of the Gods |
| 5 | The Claws & Thorns have access to a number of beasts, brought out from the forests and caves of Titan and they are more than happy to let them hunt. Sometimes goblins, orcs and so on can be tricked into doing their bidding | Chaos Unleashed |
| 6 | Finding powerful magic items or spells is one way that the society, which is small in numbers, can hope to prevail against the teeming multitudes | Winds of Magic |

## Lair

**City:** As guardians of nature, the Claws & Thorns are uncomfortable in the city. They will have found a forgotten piece of ground and hemmed it in with thorns that grew with unnatural speed. The entranceway is marked with a type of standing stone, engraved with a swirling pattern.

**Dungeon:** A dungeon that has been overrun by nature, with vines crawling on walls, fungus sprouting from the floor, and numerous crawling beasts and insects in the greenery.

**Wilderness:** The wilderness is the home for the Claw & Thorns, who are particularly attached to places rich in life like ancient forests, waterfalls, or ponds of clean, fresh water. The exceptional quality of the scenery is noted as a sign that nature's guardians are nearby.

## Confrontation

**Lortel the Swift:**
- **SKILL:** 5 (Staves 2)
- **STAMINA:** 14
- **Devotion:** 6
- **Weapon:** Staff
- **Armour:** Leather Hauberk

Lortel is slight in stature but possesses the wiry strength and vitality of a young ferret, known for his cunning, tenacity, and ability to take down much larger animals. Lortel is not truly malicious but wants to preserve the wilds. He will attempt to reason with the hero during combat, trying to persuade them to join his cause. He fights entirely using the Defensive combat option. Each round, the hero must roll an opposed test using Religion, Animal, or Forest Lore (their choice) to debate Lortel's actions. Lortel has a Religion Lore skill of 8, and the hero rolls 2d6 for him to compare to their total. The hero needs to win this argument (by winning the contested roll) ten times to convince Lortel to stop his attacks.

If Lortel's STAMINA is reduced to 6 or less, he will use the "Heal" priestly power to restore 6 points of STAMINA. After 15 rounds of combat (or debate), he will decide he has heard enough, issue a command causing roots and tendrils to burst from the ground and grasp the hero's feet and legs. Lortel will then transform into a pine marten and dash away to find a new lair.

## Item

**The Forest's Ear:** If Lortel is defeated, he leaves behind an oaken ear-horn. This item allows the user to communicate with animals for 10 minutes per day. However, the animals can only 'talk' according to their natural intelligence.

## Henchman

**Tree Man:**
- **SKILL:** 5
- **STAMINA:** 8
- **Weapon:** Branch x2, treat as Clubs
- **Armour:** Heavy

Lortel uses young Tree Men as his eyes and ears in the city. This is dangerous work for them, but they have a perfect disguise, able to stand still and appear as just another tree. The Tree Men draw power from the earth and will heal one STAMINA each round if they are in a "Park" location.

## Retaliation

If Lortel is frustrated by the hero's interference with his plans, he sends a murder of crows to harass the hero. These smart creatures will follow the hero, taking turns to swoop down to peck or even aim their droppings towards the hero's head. If the hero attempts to retaliate, the crows will simply flap away. This activity is highly distracting: when the hero has a social or challenge encounter, they must roll a 1d6. On a roll of 1, the crows have "got at you," and the hero takes a -2 penalty to all rolls for that encounter.
