# The Warlord - Grark Gutburster

## Description

For the orcs, raiding is a way of life. Humans, elves, and dwarves are better at farming and crafting, making it easier and more fun for orcs to steal from them. Most raids are small, but strong or clever orcs can gather clans into a warband to pillage larger settlements.

Grark Gutburster emerges from his tent at dusk to survey his troops, chewing on a sheep's thigh, with his hound 'Axemouth' by his side. He has worked to unite orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins into a warband, and the constant struggle to keep them from fracturing. Only brute force allows Grark to maintain cohesion for raids on human plains.

He reaches a cliff's edge, overlooking forests, mountains, and plains dotted with human towns and farms. He plots his campaign, identifying a low pass, a river to follow to farmsteads for pillage and resupply, and a smudge of smoke on the horizon marking a great human city rich in gold, slaves, and plunder. This is why he forged his warband, and where he seeks either death or glory.

## Motivation

Raid! Pillage! Fight! The aim is to gather gold and plunder, then retreat to caves before civilized peoples (or heroes) gather an army to destroy them.

## Lair

**City:** Grark has found a way to enter and leave the city as he pleases - a route through the catacombs that emerges into a cellar or basement that he has secured. The room has been cleared out, its main contents are a fire with a cookpot hung over it and some straw and furs for bedding. There is a concealed exit with a goblin mechanism to collapse the passage for escape.

**Dungeon:** Grark has commandeered part of a foetid dungeon as his quarters, with a concealed exit for escape.

**Wilderness:** Grark's skilled goblins have built a wood longhouse surrounded by a palisade, concealed by the landscape, as orcs prefer sleeping rough to building structures.

## Confrontation

**The Warlord:**
- **SKILL:** 8
- **STAMINA:** 14
- **Armour:** Chainmail Hauberk + Large Shield
- **Weapon:** Battle Axe (Knightbreaker)
- **Special:** Grark Gutburster is particularly tough - he reduces all damage by one point.

**Axemouth:**
- **SKILL:** 4
- **STAMINA:** 8
- **Weapon:** Large Bite
- **Armour:** Light

Grark's huge hound, Axemouth, fights by Grark's side, requiring a separate combat roll. Axemouth is adept at darting from behind Grark's shield to nip at opponents. Axemouth cannot be directly targeted while Grark lives. When Grark's STAMINA is reduced to 6 or less, he commands Axemouth to launch a final, suicidal attack, pinning the opponent down, allowing Grark to escape through a concealed exit. The next time Grark is faced, he will be without his dog.

## Item

**Knightbreaker:** Grark's huge battle axe is magical, and enemies hit by it suffer a -1 penalty to their Armour or Dodge skill rolls.

## Henchmen

**Doragar:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 9
- **Armour:** Leather Hauberk
- **Weapon:** 2-Handed Sword

The Doragar are tough and fearless warriors who have no fear of death. Even when reduced to zero STAMINA, they will continue to fight for one round.

## Retaliation

Grark Gutburster does not want heroes interfering. If engaged in a fight, he will send Goblin Infiltrator's (referencing encounter C10) to stab the hero until they give up. The goblins are cowardly and will wait for a challenge encounter before attacking. This happens once per day on the first challenge encounter (combat in wilderness or dungeon), and the hero must fight the goblin in addition to whatever else they face.
