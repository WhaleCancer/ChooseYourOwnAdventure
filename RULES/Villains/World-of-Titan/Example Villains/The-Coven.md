# The Coven

## Description

The Coven exists anywhere there are peasants facing problems they can't deal with on their own. The Coven have power and do use it to help - for a price. A price which always ends up being far greater than described. The Coven exist to prey on the good nature of others and take advantage of their troubles. So a farmer, wanting a cure for his diseased herd might make an agreement with a witch that his son will work for her for a year - his cattle will be healed, but after the year of work his son will come back slack jawed and seemingly witless. Or a woman might ask for good fortune with her business - then later on, her husband steals the gold she makes and runs off leaving her penniless once more. Agreements with witches are known as devil's bargains for a reason.

"Hubble bubble toil and trouble! Is that what you expected?" said Kristin with a laugh as she took the gift of herbs and put them on her kitchen table. "It's not how you think it is, young man, not like that at all". Jaume relaxed and wondered why he was so nervous. Kristin was just another hedge witch. Out of the window of her shack he could see a small blond haired child digging in the herb garden and he wondered why the others had been so wary of asking her for help. He took a seat on a wooden stool and waited as the woman, dressed in the usual woolen shift and robes of a servant, picked up the bundle of herbs and wandered over to her stove. For a moment she was absorbed in sifting and mixing the herbs on her stove until she turned back to look Jaume directly in the eyes - and he was transfixed with fear as the woman's eyes blazed with an unnatural marshlight green and Jaume teetered on the edge of unconsciousness. As she held him with her gaze Kristin spoke again, but now her voice had the tone and timbre of a much older woman frail but at the same time full of certainty and power. "Let me tell you how it is, little fool. If you want my help, you must give something for it. A bargain must be made and the cost will not be easy to pay!". The strange light faded from Kristin's eyes and she turned back to sorting through the herbs. Jaume came back to his senses a few moments later, his breath heavy and his heart hammering in his chest. He got to his feet unsteadily and silently staggered out of the little cottage. "Come back when you are ready to pay, Jaume. Your wife won't get better without my help" said Kristin as he left. It was only on the way home he realised that he had never got to discussing the reason for his visit.

## Motivation

The witches of The Coven are cruel and greedy. They have made an alliance with a dark power, usually a demon, and they enjoy using those powers to torment others and control them. Their purposes vary from witch to witch but most often it is simply for the pleasure of seeing other people suffer.

### Mission Generator for The Coven - Refer to Table 10.1.1 Campaign Missions

| Roll | Secret Scheme | Roll on the mission table under.. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-3 | As magic users the Coven employ a variety of magical effects and devices to achieve their aims. | Winds of Magic |
| 4-5 | Witches are not priestesses but their magic is gifted from demons or other powers; powers that expect to get something in return. | Fury of the Gods |
| 6 | Mere carnage is not particularly satisfactory for a witch, but it will suffice when other options aren't available. | Chaos Unleashed |

## Lair

**City:** The Coven like to hide in plain sight - their base of operations will be a small shack or hovel which is almost indistinguishable from any other. They are fond of attracting urchins to act as errand boys, though in time some of them will mysteriously vanish…the cauldron has to be kept full, after all.

**Dungeon:** Witches prey on people - human, elf or dwarf - but there are always ingredients for the cauldron that can only be found in the dank corridors of a trap filled tomb. If they do need to be in a dungeon they will have fenced off a room or two and put in a space for the cauldron. Even underground witches like to maintain the idea that they are simply the village wise-woman, and nothing more sinister.

**Wilderness:** A simple hut, clean swept, with a garden of herbs and a coop of chickens at the back is an ideal home for a witch. Usually close enough to a path or road that a curious traveller might knock on her door and end up as fodder for the cauldron.

## Confrontation

**Kristin Wert, Witch:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 10
- **Devotion:** 7
- **Weapon:** Dagger
- **Armour:** None (Dodge skill 4)

"Oh, so you've found me out, have you, dear? How unfortunate..for you!" With a shriek the witch will fly at you. Her disguise as a young woman falls away to reveal her haggard appearance, a face reflecting her foul nature. Her patron has granted her the power of Glamour. For rounds equal to her Devotion her eyes will glow with a fierce green light that fills anyone that sees it with dread - the effect is that All rolls are made with a penalty of -1. On the final (seventh) round her eyes blaze brighter and the Hero must test their LUCK or flee! By the time you have recovered, Kristin Wert has fled and you must track her down.

## Item

**Carved Toadstool:** Kristin Wert carries a crudely carved toadstool, which radiates magic. Once a day, the bearer can curse another creature to suffer -1 to all rolls for one hour. The toadstool can also rid the bearer of a curse, but that drains it for one week.

## Henchmen

**Entranced Man:**
- **SKILL:** 7
- **STAMINA:** 8
- **Weapon:** Battle Axe
- **Armour:** Leather Cuirass

It is a favourite trick of witches to place a glamour on some tough but stupid young man (often woodsmen) and use them as bodyguards. They may snap out of it when severely wounded - when reduced to 3 STAMINA or less they Entranced Man must make a 1d6 roll - on a 1 or 2 the enchantment lifts and they will fall to their knees and surrender.

## Retaliation

**Curses:** You have been marked as the victim of an unending stream of curses. Each day whilst you battle The Coven you must roll (at the start of the day) to see what happens. The curse lasts a day (when you get a new one!) or until you defeat your opponent.

### Table 9.1.2 Curses. Test against your LUCK or suffer the effect described.

| Roll | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Curse of Stench:** A foul odour emanates from you, causing anyone nearby to feel nauseous. Suffer a -1 penalty to all Social tests. |
| 2 | **Curse of Withering:** Evil magic weakens you as if you were ill. Lose 2 STAMINA. |
| 3 | **Curse of Clumsiness:** Your limbs are not quite under control. Movement tests are at -1. |
| 4 | **Curse of Stupidity:** Your mind is fogged! Knowledge and MAGIC tests are at -1. |
| 5 | **Curse of Cowardice:** Fear courses through your veins. Suffer a -1 penalty to all combat skills. |
| 6 | **Curse failed!** For some reason, the magic of the curse failed. Restore one point of LUCK. |
