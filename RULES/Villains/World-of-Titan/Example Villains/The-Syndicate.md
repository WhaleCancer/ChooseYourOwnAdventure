# The Syndicate

## Description

The Syndicate is a group of like minded individuals who are completely unscrupulous when it comes to their ambitions, whether that be money, power or a twisted sense of pleasure.

They prefer the finer things in life, making plans over finest delicacies, and enjoying fine wines from the best stocked cellars. They adhere to certain niceties, such as members wearing a mask and robed and hooded in black (satin or silk, not cloth). Bringing a personal taster to prevent an 'accidental' poisoning is acceptable. Members use code names for identification.

The Vaultmaster is the most senior and trusted member, responsible for arranging meetings and compiling guest lists. A love of profit is not enough to earn an invitation, only the most cutthroat and brutal of merchants can expect an invitation. The Vaultmaster position is both a blessing and a curse, granting great power over information and standing but incurring enormous costs for protecting The Syndicate from detection, noting "Assassins aren't cheap."

## Motivation

The purpose of The Syndicate is to enrich its members as much as possible no matter what the consequences are for the people of the world. Their ambitions go far beyond controlling trade routes or manipulating prices. Starting a war to push up the price of weapons is considered "mundane." Assassinating a ruler that is opposed to slavery is deemed "troublesome, but not unreasonable." Unleashing a plague for which the only cure is a herb that is under your control is presented as an act that "might get you a round of applause over dinner." Nothing is considered off-limits in the pursuit of gold, even if it harms your 'colleagues' to the point where they "can no longer afford their fees," which is presented as a "prize."

**Solomon 'Silver' Fox** is not a dwarf of imposing stature, compensating with extravagant jewellery (mostly silver of course) and hiring the largest men he can find as bodyguards. His appearance includes coiffured grey hair, a heavy combination of perfumes for scent, and acerbic wit, ensuring he always stands out from the crowd - which usually consists of people he employs.

Fox has gained, lost and regained greater fortunes than most princes ever get their hands on. He is doing well but his dreams are haunted by even greater avarice. He has put in motion strategies that carry great risk - even a man of his wealth would not be able to bribe his way out of a charge of treason.

## Lair

**City:** A member of The Syndicate in good standing must maintain a decent sized manor, complete with servants and the usual trappings of wealth, but this is not where they carry out their criminal enterprises. When you track them down you will find a concealed office within a nondescript building or warehouse, used for "off the books" ledgers and contracts.

**Dungeon:** A Syndicate dungeon is a well-appointed, lit, swept, and maintained underground area, resembling an inn more than a dungeon, featuring a bedroom, office, and guardrooms at a minimum.

**Wilderness:** If Syndicate members need to spend time in the wilds, they do so in comfort, with their lair being a hunting lodge equipped with sufficient provisions.

## Confrontation

**Solomon 'Silver' Fox:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 10
- **Weapon:** Dagger
- **Armour:** None

**Bodyguard:**
- **SKILL:** 7
- **STAMINA:** 12
- **Weapon:** Sword
- **Armour:** Chain hauberk

The player must fight Fox's bodyguard first, as Fox is unreachable with a melee weapon until the bodyguard is defeated. At the start of combat, a 2d6 roll determines the number of rounds Fox has to destroy evidence (burning letters, ripping up contracts). If Fox completes this, he escapes through a backdoor, and the player must restart tracking him.

If the bodyguard is defeated in time, the player faces Fox, who is not a strong fighter and attempts to clear incriminating documents. Fox will try to bribe the player; roll 10d6 for the amount of gold offered. Accepting the bribe results in losing one LUCK point and having to track Fox down again. This is a one-time offer; if found again, he will fight. Refusing the bribe leads to an immediate fight to the death with Fox.

## Item

**Fox's Sharp Eye:** If Fox is defeated, the hero finds a jeweller's eyeglass that grants a +1 bonus to Evaluate skill tests when used to examine an object.

## Henchmen

**Sneaky Thug:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 10
- **Weapon:** Sword
- **Armour:** Leather Hauberk

The Syndicate employs scum and lowlifes for dirty work, easily recruited from local jails for a fat coin purse. These thugs are tough, sneaky, and prefer to stay in the shadows. On the first round of combat, players must make an Awareness skill test or be surprised, granting the thugs a free attack with a +4 bonus to their combat roll.

## Retaliation

The Syndicate uses monetary means for retaliation: Once a threat is identified, they pay people to make life harder for the troublemaker. When battling The Syndicate, a 1d6 roll is required during social encounters. On a roll of 1, the NPC has been bribed and refuses to help, forcing the player to move to the next encounter. Additionally, battling The Syndicate imposes a -2 penalty to all Bargain skill rolls, as merchants avoid dealing with the player.
