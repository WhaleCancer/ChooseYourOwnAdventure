# The Magician - Taz Remak

## Description

Magicians seek greater power with little regard for common people, often using orcs, goblins, and other agents in their pursuit of knowledge.

Deep in the night, Taz Remak sifts through parchments lit by enchanted glow-orbs, searching for clues to uncover lost artifacts. His hands move like a scorpion and his fingers touch a fire-charred ancient book, which he opens to work through pages he knows by heart, believing the knowledge he seeks is within.

At dawn, Taz Remak looks up from his studies and walks to the window to stretch and take in the view. He is an older, handsome man with grey hair and beard, deep-set eyes, and a sharp nose. His gaze is cold, like a hawk's, suggesting he could be mistaken for a merchant but possesses a predatory intensity.

The magician watches a peasant pulling a vegetable cart to the marketplace. He reflects on how his pursuit of ancient knowledge might lead to many deaths, but dismisses the concern, comparing it to a farmer sacrificing lambs. He realizes he hasn't eaten and decides to take a break from his studies to make plans, seeing the city as full of mysteries he intends to unravel.

## Motivation

Taz Remak is obsessed with finding ancient artefacts and lore to increase his magical knowledge and power.

### The Magician Mission Generator - Refer to Table 10.1.1 Campaign Missions

| Roll | Secret Scheme | Roll on the mission table under.. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-4 | The power of magic is there for the taking, but only the wisest know how. Years of research and practice are needed to achieve greatness, now is the time to put that knowledge to use. | Winds of Magic |
| 5 | Magic is above even the greatest king, but even dull minds have their uses. A bit of gold or flattery works as well as any spell and it is the ends, not the means, which matter. | Lust for Power |
| 6 | Crude tools give crude results. Stooping to such devices is regrettable, but practising one's control over the lesser minds? That is knowledge worth pursuing. | Chaos Unleashed |

## Lair

**City:** The magician is careful not to lead anyone back to his true sanctum, but instead has set up a temporary base from which to conduct his operations. This is a large tent, split into two rooms (a bedroom and a simple study). The tent is made of coloured cloth with mystical runes highlighted in gold and silver. If the magician flees or is defeated, the tent and its contents disappear with a loud puffing noise and a large cloud of dust.

**Dungeon:** Taz Remak's non-natural dungeon denizen setup. One room is cleaned up and fitted with a heavy oak door. Inside, glowing orbs illuminate a desk covered in parchments with "increasingly deranged scrawls." A simple cot is to one side, indicating it's not a room Taz wishes to spend much time in.

**Wilderness:** The large tent (from the "Lair" section) being used as a temporary base in the wilds. It was brought out by his servants (described as cowards who will not fight). Taz has erected an earthen wall around it for protection using his magic.

## Confrontation

**Taz Remak:**

- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 12
- **MAGIC:** 5 (Arcane Power 8, MP 30)
- **Armour:** None (Dodge skill 3)
- **Weapon:** Staff

Dressed in fine robes, wields a carved oaken staff, fights with magic. Uses 'Flash!' on the first round, then 'Fire Bolt' to "whittle down the hero."

Taz Remak dislikes fighting, especially when hurt. If damaged, he will teleport away "unless you can taunt him to stay." If hit, a test against the hero's Con special skill is made; success means he stays, failure means he teleports.

A villain disappearing in a puff of smoke at the start of the next round, requiring tracking. Each confrontation makes him angrier, and he stays one more round before teleporting (2 rounds the second time, 3 rounds the third, and so on). Great is the pride of wizards....and still greater their fall!

## Item

**Scarf of Many Colours:** Taz uses it to go about town unnoticed. Subtly alters the wearer's appearance, granting +1 to Disguise skill tests.

## Henchmen

**Apprentice:**

- **SKILL:** 4
- **STAMINA:** 8
- **MAGIC:** 3 (Arcane Power 5, MP 14)
- **Weapon:** Staff
- **Armour:** None (Dodge skill 2)

Taz has recruited apprentices desperate to impress him and learn greater magic. They fight using 'Weakness' spell on the first round, then 'Flash!', after which they use their staves. They are "ultimately cowards" and will surrender "in tears" if reduced to STAMINA of 2 or less. It's up to you what you do about that.

## Retaliation

Once "riled," the magician will attempt to destroy enemies from afar. Method: Scrying out their location and sending a "magically animated club" to bash them. Scrying is time-consuming; Taz Remak cannot afford to do it daily. A 1d6 roll determines if he finds the target (1, 2, or 3 means success). If found, another 1d6 roll determines when the club appears (1-2: morning, 3-4: midday, 5-6: evening). The animated club has SKILL 8. Effect: If it loses a round of combat (i.e., takes damage), the 'Animate' spell ends. Damage: It deals damage as a normal, non-magical club.
