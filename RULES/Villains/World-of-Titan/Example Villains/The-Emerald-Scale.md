# The Emerald Scale

## Description

The Lizardmen of Silur Cha control a great empire and dispatch secret saboteur groups, known as 'The Emerald Scale', to cause damage. These groups hire mercenaries because Lizardmen cannot move openly. A pristine crocodile scale serves as a secret token for agents.

Ruthen Nive dismounts his horse and walks towards a hidden den, feeling watched. The text describes the danger of the area, mentioning poisoned darts and the Lizardmen's view of humans as "just another type of meat."

Ruthen approaches a cave entrance guarded by two large lizardmen with spears. Ruthen feels like prey but enters the torch-lit cave. The cave is surprisingly warm with wisps of steam making surfaces slippery. Ruthen eventually reaches the rear chamber and meets Chel Vak, the leader of the lizardmen and Ruthen's employer.

The room's setup is in "lizardman style," featuring heat, moisture, a natural pool, and a cunningly designed steamer where Chel Vak is lounging. It explains that lizardmen need warmth to avoid becoming sluggish.

Chel Vak hisses as Ruthen shows respect. Ruthen reports completing his task and asks about future service. Chel Vak praises Ruthen, promises more gold and plans, and states he will visit Ruthen's city. Ruthen grins, indicating his willingness to betray his own people for payment.

## Motivation

The Emerald Scale are mercenaries who work for gold, commit crimes for treasure, and are directed by Lizardmen to weaken and disrupt the kingdoms of the world.

## Lair

**City:** The Lizardmen, away from their homes, crave the warmth and humidity of the swamps. Thus the lair will be in a cave or underground passage - effectively a miniature catacomb - that contains access to a source of water such as a spring or underground river. Coals or magic heat the water to a steamy temperature. Lizardmen can escape by diving into the water and slithering down a hidden pipe, and they can hold their breath longer than humans.

**Dungeon:** Dungeon lairs are similar to city lairs, featuring a diverted underground watercourse that creates a pool and an escape route. Approaching these rooms, heroes will notice the air becoming misty and damp.

**Wilderness:** In the wilds, Lizardmen establish camps near natural springs or pools for bathing. In warmer regions, they prioritize areas rich in fish for hunting, while in colder areas, they seek natural hot springs as a base.

## Confrontation

**Chel Vak, Lizardman Shaman:**
- **SKILL:** 7
- **STAMINA:** 12
- **Devotion:** 6
- **Weapon:** Spear
- **Armour:** Medium

When challenged, Chel Vak invokes Lizardmen gods to fill the room with a cloud of steam. This steam lasts for 6 rounds, obscures vision, and imposes a -2 penalty on the Hero's combat rolls (Chel Vak is unaffected). If he is still alive after this time, he will escape into the water, requiring the Hero to track him down again.

## Item

**Ring of Warmth:** A magical ring owned by Chel Vak that protects against cold. The wearer takes one less point of damage from cold (including magical cold) and can use the minor magic spell 'Weather Protection' once per day.

## Hench(lizard)men

**Lizardman:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 11
- **Weapon:** Spear
- **Armour:** Medium

Lizardmen are fanatically loyal to Chel Vak and despise "warmbloods," attacking ferociously. Their weapons are also poison-coated, inflicting one point of STAMINA damage per hit (not prevented by armour). If defeated, a vial of this poison can be recovered (enough for one combat or 10 arrows). The poison has no effect on Lizardmen.

**Chel Vak's Poisoned Spear:** Chel Vak's spear is coated with poison, inflicting one additional point of STAMINA damage per hit, which armour does not prevent. If Chel Vak is defeated, a vial of this poison can be recovered, sufficient to coat one weapon for one combat or 10 arrows. The poison has no effect on Lizardmen.

## Retaliation

Chel Vak will not tolerate interference. He summons a Monstrous Fly (referencing encounter C28) using the foetid powers of the swamp gods to pursue the interferer. A daily roll determines when the fly finds the target: 1-2 for dawn to midday, 3-4 for midday to dusk, and 5-6 for failure to find. A new fly will be summoned to search each day.
