# The Horde

## Description

The Horde is formed from the "loose ends" left by heroes after defeating major villains (e.g., goblins that fled, an ogre asleep, giant slugs). These creatures band together under strong leadership to seek revenge on the civilized world, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.

Thumper Grunk's routine was beating slaves in the mines, drinking ale, and sleeping. Upon waking, he discovers the mines are empty of slaves but filled with the bodies of his fellow trolls, realizing a hero has "swept through and ruined everything!" He scratches his "knobbly head" and wonders, "what's a thumper like me going to do now?" as he has no one left to beat.

Grunk's initial idleness in the mine, his dwindling supplies, and how spotting the lights of a human town ignited a sudden rage. He decides it's time to "get to work" and acquire "new fleshbags to do all the mining and slaving" and "new squealers to thump." He gathers surviving goblins, puts them in charge of a bear, and sets off, confident that "puny humans would stand no chance."

## Motivation

The Horde's lack of a grand plan or goal, other than destruction and carnage. They are likened to a swarm of locusts, moving across the landscape and leaving a trail of misery in their wake. While they sometimes battle humans, dwarves, or elves, just as often they simply fall apart after a few months of pillaging.

## Lair

**City:** The Horde will have a place to meet and plot, but it won't be chosen with any great care. It could be a broken down hovel, forgotten cave or cellar, with the only signs of occupation being some crude bedding and a firepit for cooking. They won't bother repairing or decorating, and their presence reduces the location to an abandoned hovel.

**Dungeon:** Dungeons are The Horde's "home ground," and they occupy parts that remind them of where they "first crawled out of."

**Wilderness:** The Horde's tendency to get lost, their crude camp-making from available vegetation, and their preference for natural caves or shelters. It notes their lack of concealment efforts, leading to an increase in dead beasts and trampled or burnt plants in the surrounding countryside.

## Confrontation

**Thumper Grunk:**
- **SKILL:** 8
- **STAMINA:** 14
- **Weapon:** 'The Thumper' (described as a large spiked club, treated as a Morning Star for damage)
- **Armour:** Monster Heavy

Thumper Grunk's initial surprise, giving him a -2 to his combat roll in the first round. From the second round onwards, he will blow an antler-bone horn to summon help. A roll of 1d6 at the start of each round, on a 1-2, will cause a goblin (SKILL 4 STAMINA 6 Weapon: Club Armour: Light) to appear, climbing through a broken window or dropping from a hole in the roof to aid him. He will continue to blow the horn, potentially leading to "a lot of goblins can flood the room."

If players choose to retreat, the goblins will let them go, jeering and laughing, without suffering free attacks. If Thumper Grunk is encountered again, he will have healed his wounds, but the goblins will be "bored of coming to the rescue" and only appear on a 1 on 1d6.

## Item

**Bag of Holding:** A nondescript bag found on Thumper Grunk. It functions as a Bag of Holding, counting as one item for encumbrance but capable of carrying five items worth of goods without becoming heavier. It contains "4d6 meals worth of rotten meat," with a parenthetical note that "heroes may wish to clean it before they use it."

## Henchman

**Wild Hobgoblin:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 9
- **Weapon:** Short Sword x2
- **Armour:** Light

This Hobgoblin is driven to the edge of madness by the slaughter of his tribe. He wields a short sword in each hand, choosing to "swing madly instead of protecting himself." He curses and spits during a fight, though the player will have "no idea what he's saying."

## Retaliation

The Horde lacks the planning or intellect to organise retaliation. Instead, the very presence of a swarm of angry violent monsters bolsters those allied to their cause. When fighting The Horde, every evil humanoid (orc, goblin, hobgoblin etc) encountered receives a bonus of +1 to SKILL and STAMINA. This bonus applies to all monsters in Catacombs, dungeons and the wilderness.
