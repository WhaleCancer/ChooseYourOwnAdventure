# The Sorcerer - Zeoltan the Immolator

## Description

Sorcerers are unpredictable spellcasters whose power comes from an innate quality, not learned lessons. They often believe they are chosen to rise above common folk, leading to distrust and suspicion from others.

Lady Zeoltan Geara, also known as "Zeoltan the Immolator," is a lone, well-dressed, unarmored woman riding a horse who is ambushed by bandits. Her expression shifts from "tired boredom" to "malicious glee" as her eyes "blazed with a sudden fire." She then unleashes "gouts of glowing flame" from her wrists and palms, turning the bandits into "spinning, tumbling fire sprites" that burn uncontrollably.

Within moments it was all over. The bandits were silent smoking corpses scattered near the edge of the road. Zeoltan calmly pats her horse and continues her journey, finding the event a "pleasant diversion" but now tired and seeking comfort in a city.

## Motivation

Zeoltan is driven by fierce pride in her powers and the joy of using them, desiring to cause destruction and dominate others.

| 1-2 | Only I, the sorcerer, am capable of harnessing the power of magic to its full extent. Let others tremble at my mastery of the arcane! | Winds of Magic |
| 3-4 | It is only natural that people flock to do my bidding. Very well, I shall find tasks that suit their meagre talents. | Lust for Power |
| 5-6 | Perhaps one day I shall grow strong enough to challenge them, but for now even I must bow to the gods and make use of their blessings. | Fury of the Gods |

## Lair

**City:** The Sorcerer is proud but not foolish. She has obtained a rented room of some style and quality from which to carry out her plots. This is a pleasantly furnished room, light and airy - the sort of place where it would be nice to spend an afternoon taking tea. She maintains the pretense of being a young noblewoman.

**Dungeon:** Zeoltan's dungeon lair is basic, with a cot and fireplace, distinctive only for being cleaner and warmer than other dungeon areas, as she prioritizes important work over impressing visitors.

**Wilderness:** Zeoltan's wilderness lair is a hut or farmhouse she has taken for herself, killing previous inhabitants if necessary. The building is made livable, and it features a very well-stocked woodpile, which she likes to keep burning day and night.

## Confrontation

**Zeoltan the Immolator:**
- **SKILL:** 5
- **STAMINA:** 14
- **MAGIC:** 5 Inner Power 8
- **Armour:** None (Dodge skill 3)
- **Weapon:** Dagger

Despite carrying a dagger, Lady Zeoltan Geara primarily uses magic for defense. Her spells are 'SIX' (used at the start of a fight) and 'HOT' (used until she runs out of STAMINA). She is immune to damage from her own fiery spells and is unconcerned about turning her lair into an inferno.

If injured, she can snap her fingers to teleport the player across the city (or to another section in a dungeon, or an adjacent area in the wilderness). The player must drop a dice to determine their new location. This magic is taxing and can only be used once a week. If found again within the week, she will fight to the death.

## Item

**Pendant of Obsidian:** A necklace Zeoltan wears, holding a shard of obsidian, which can absorb one lightning-based magical attack against its wearer once per day. This is noted as a precaution against other magic users.

## Henchman

**Bedazzled Noble:**
- **SKILL:** 6
- **STAMINA:** 8
- **Armour:** Leather Hauberk
- **Weapon:** Sword

Zeoltan has charmed minor nobles from failing houses to act as her agents. These "bedazzled" nobles will fight to the death to save her. It's noted that she avoids recruiting other magic users, as she desires no rivals. Fighting these henchmen serves to remind the player of their inferiority compared to Zeoltan.

## Retaliation

Zeoltan doesn't want heroes stopping her. When engaged in combat (with her or anyone else), the player must roll 1d6 each round. On a roll of 1, a part of their clothing or weapon will burst into scorching flame, causing 1d3 points of STAMINA damage to the player (but not damaging the item). This can only happen once per day.
