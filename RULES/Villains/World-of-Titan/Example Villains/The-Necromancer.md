# The Necromancer - Merrick Trench

## Description

Necromancy is a rare power that almost always leads to a desire to turn the entire world into a graveyard.

**From the Journals of Merrick Trench:**

Merrick Trench's father was a poor gravedigger, and their family's living situation was in an abandoned crypt near icy mountains, a dark forest, and freezing mist, where people came to await their end in shared misery.

Merrick's childhood was spent playing in the graveyard, listening to crows, staring into the empty eye sockets of skulls, and feeling a deep connection to the dead. He heard their voices in dreams and saw their spirits, eventually discovering he could talk to and command them, a secret he kept.

His parents succumbed to "tomb-rot." Upon his father's death, Merrick saw his ghost rise and, using his willpower, forced it back into the body. His father continued to dig graves, but this situation was unsustainable.

His discovery came due to the smell of decay, his sentencing to entombment in the crypt with his rotting father, and being left to starve. In the darkness, he felt the presence of the dead, called out to them, and felt them stirring, digging their way to the surface "clod by clod." He imagines the terror of the villagers witnessing corpses rising from their graves.

He directed the undead to free him. Upon emerging, he commanded his "soldiers" (the undead) to carry out "retributive justice," resulting in the village being "cleansed of every living soul." He amassed a "shuffling, clacking brigade of troops." Some villagers escaped on horses to alert the king's men. Merrick gathered supplies, found an old pony, and realized his unique talent was ready for a "bigger stage."

## Motivation

Merrick Trench is motivated by a combination of vengeance and obsession. He wishes to show the world his power and unleash the undead!

## Lair

**City:** Happiest when surrounded by the architecture of death, Merrick Trench has forced his way into an abandoned crypt. The inside barely qualifies as lodgings - just enough room has been made for a simple bed and a place cleared to accommodate a firepit and cookpot. The room is decorated with coffins and skeletons.

**Dungeon:** A tomb-like dungeon lair, partitioned by a gate made of bones, emphasizing the necromancer's comfort in the dark.

**Wilderness:** A wilderness lair, such as a bear cave or old battle site, where the necromancer builds a simple camp with a tent of bone and hide, surrounded by rotting animal carcasses.

## Confrontation

**Merrick Trench:**
- **SKILL:** 5 (Clubs 2)
- **STAMINA:** 13
- **MAGIC:** 5
- **Devotion:** 7
- **Weapon:** Mace
- **Armour:** Leather Hauberk and Small Shield

He is blessed by the god of Death, uses 'Ill Luck' on the first round, and fights hand-to-hand thereafter. He exudes an icy, energy-draining aura. If he hits with his weapon, he causes one additional point of STAMINA damage and heals one point of STAMINA for himself by draining the Hero's life.

The necromancer will not flee. After being defeated, he will rise as a revenant and return to work, but will no longer be able to drain STAMINA from the Hero in subsequent fights.

## Item

**Almanac of Ancient Sins:** A magical leather-bound tome found in a crypt. Once a day, it can be used to chastise an undead creature, reducing its movement to walking pace and preventing it from attacking for three rounds.

## Henchman

**Ghoul:**
- **SKILL:** 5
- **STAMINA:** 9
- **Weapons:** Medium Claw
- **Armour:** Light

A Ghoul's touch is paralysing if it hits four times in combat. Merrick Trench uses freshly raised ghouls whose will and personality are gone, but are not decayed to mindlessness and can pass as human with make-up and a hood.

## Retaliation

The necromancer's ability to call upon spirits of the dead. Upon defeating an enemy, rolling a 1 on a 1d6 brings it back to life as a zombie version of itself, attacking again. This zombie version has its SKILL and STAMINA reduced by two compared to the original, and this can happen an unlimited number of times per day. Unnerving!
