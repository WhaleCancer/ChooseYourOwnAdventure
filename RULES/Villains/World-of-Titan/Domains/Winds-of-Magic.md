# Winds of Magic

This domain encompasses any villain that uses one of the MAGIC traditions to gain power - typically wizards and sorcerers, but if you have access to other AFF rulebooks containing different traditions, such as the combat magic described in the AFF Combat Companion, those can also be used. Roll 1d6 - 1-2: Wizard, 3-4: Sorcerer, 5-6: Other or roll again.

In addition to some magical ability, these villains have points in special skills from the Knowledge and Magical sections of the skills list.

## Characteristics and Skills

Those that rely on magic are less physically capable than some other villains. They have SKILL = 3+1d3, STAMINA = 8+1d6 (sorcerers have 10+1d6) and MAGIC = 5+1d3. They have 3 points in the relevant special skill (MAGIC-Sorcery etc) and you will need to calculate their Magic Points and provide them with a list of spells to use. They have 2 points in Magical special skills and most Knowledge special skills.
