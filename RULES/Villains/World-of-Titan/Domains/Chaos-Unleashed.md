# Chaos Unleashed

A broadsword cuts with both edges, and those that excel in the arts of combat can choose to defend the world against evil as great knights and captains or to use their skills for darker, more selfish purposes. These are warriors of some sort or another and you should define their specific details, such as "heavily armed juggernauts swinging greatswords or lightly armoured duelists swishing their rapier?" Almost every type of fighter can provide a challenging foe.

These villains have points in special skills from the Movement and Combat sections of the skills list.

## Characteristics and Skills

Warriors are skillful and tough. They have SKILL = 5+1d3, STAMINA = 12+1d6 and MAGIC = 0. They have 2 points in Movement special skills, 3 points in Armour and one type of hand weapon (swords, axes etc) and 2 points in another two weapon types.
