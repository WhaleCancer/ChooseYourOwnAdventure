# Fury of the Gods

This section describes different types of divine servants (priests, zealots, templars) and how to determine their type by rolling a 1d6. A templar is a villain with a specific talent, one daily ability, a devotion of 5, and no MAGIC characteristic. These villains have special skills from the Knowledge and Combat sections of the skills list.

## Characteristics and Skills

Those that rely on the gods are robust and wise. They have SKILL = 4+1d3, STAMINA = 10+1d6, and MAGIC = 3+1d3. Priests receive 3 points in the Magic-Priestly special skill and require powers from Table 7.1.3 (List of the Gods), generally following a neutral or evil god. Templars have one power per day and a Devotion of 5. Zealots have no magical power but gain +1 SKILL. All servants have 2 points in Knowledge special skills, 2 points in Armour, and one type of hand weapon (e.g., swords, axes).
