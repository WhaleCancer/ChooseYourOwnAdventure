# Computers

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Low, Medium, High

Digital tools dominate the future, and being able to use, program and even repair computers is a must. The Computers skill allows Heroes to use these important machines, as well as repair and refit them, program them to do their bidding and, if the situation calls for it, hack into them and change things around a little. This doesn't just apply to the machines fitted to your ship, or the hand-held computers you use - this covers all digital constructs, including robots.
