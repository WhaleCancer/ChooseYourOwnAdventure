# Monster Lores

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

This knowledge Skill provides general and specialist knowledge of some of the creatures that can be found. There are several versions of the Skill, and each must be taken separately. If a Character makes a successful test against this Skill, they are able to identify what the creature is and some basic details such as whether it has high, medium or low PHYSICAL, MENTAL, or SOCIAL (compared to the Character), an overview of what special abilities it might have and whether it has more than one attack. A Critical will reveal specific details, but a fumble will result in misleading information.

The various specialities of this Skill are described below. A Director may wish to create new Specialities or break down any of the existing ones further or assign them only to a particular region or continent:

## Specialties

### Animal

Refers to creatures like Reptile, Fish, Bird, Insect, Amphibian, Crustacean, or Mollusc. These are generally "normal" creatures that are not overtly magical or intelligent.

### Construct

Describes created beings such as Golems, Living Statues, and other artificial entities. This specialty can reveal weaknesses of these creatures.

### Demon

Focuses on creatures that originate from "The Pit" and other nether regions, often favored by those who summon or battle them.

### Humanoid

A common specialty covering various bipedal creatures native to the world, ranging from Goblins and Mudclaws to Ogres and Trolls. It includes knowledge of their culture, society, and physical attributes.

### Monster

This specialty acts as a catch-all for creatures not covered by the other categories, including hybrid creatures like Manticores and other "weird and wonderful beasts."

### Plant

Describes the many dangerous plants. This specialty provides knowledge for identifying them, which is often the best defense given their limited mobility, and how to escape if caught.

### Undead

Covers the various types of undead, each with unique powers and weaknesses. It notes that some undead can only be harmed by specific weapons or magic, and if such means are unavailable, "running away is by far the best option!!"
