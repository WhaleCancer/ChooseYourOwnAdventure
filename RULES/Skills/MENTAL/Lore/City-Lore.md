# City Lore

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

This skill provides knowledge of a specific city, allowing a Character to navigate it and find merchants or services, even if unfamiliar with the city. It represents familiarity with urban environments, local customs, and where to find what you need. This skill has a strong streetwise component, representing knowledge of the city's underworld, criminal networks, and how to navigate both legitimate and illicit urban environments.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill relies on word-of-mouth, landmarks, and local knowledge, including understanding which neighborhoods are safe and which to avoid. At **Low** tech levels (1980s), it includes understanding phone directories, public transit systems, and local business districts. It also encompasses knowledge of the criminal underworld, allowing Characters to locate and access criminals, black markets, and illicit services. Characters can use this skill to find fences, drug dealers, illegal gambling operations, and other criminal contacts. At **Medium** and **High** tech levels, it encompasses digital city networks, AI assistants, orbital city layouts, and accessing real-time urban data systems, while still maintaining its streetwise edge in navigating both legal and illegal aspects of urban life.
