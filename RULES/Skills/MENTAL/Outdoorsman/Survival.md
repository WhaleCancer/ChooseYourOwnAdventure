# Survival

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

When Planetary Navigation rolls fail, and the Hero is lost in harsh environments (desert world, ice-covered planet) or their ship crash-lands. Described as almost an instinct, emphasizing that technology often fails. Boils down to basics like starting a fire, building shelter, hunting, and knowing how to get out of trouble or avoid disaster. Can be used (with appropriate equipment) to survive a hull breach in space.
