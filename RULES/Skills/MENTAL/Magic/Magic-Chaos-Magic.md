Chaos Magic is a dangerous but powerful Wizardry school that allows replication of almost any other Magical spell by tapping into raw chaos. It offers versatility but comes at a price, with effects not always materializing and potential danger to the caster and others. Spellcasters learning Chaos Magic cannot cast traditional Wizardry or Sorcery spells. See Chapter 2 for a full description.
