The Dwarves of Titan use an ancient runic alphabet to carve their inscriptions into stone and steel alike, but have adapted this alphabet to imbue magical powers into items. This magical tradition is nowhere near as fast as the magical spells of other traditions, but can provide a Dwarven Runesmith with a significant edge. This special skill is required to inscribe Dwarven Runes (Chapter 5).
