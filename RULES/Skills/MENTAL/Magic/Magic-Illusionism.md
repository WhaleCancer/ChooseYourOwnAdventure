Illusionism is a fairly new magical style, and one that seems to be popular in towns and cities more than the rural wilds. This magical style uses magic to shape light, sound, smell and even taste to make it appear that something is real when in fact it is no more solid than a ghost. This magical style can be very powerful indeed as it does not suffer the same limitations that actually changing reality suffers from, but it does also have drawbacks. A visual illusion with no smell component is unlikely to fool a wolf, and this magic almost never works on undead or demons!
