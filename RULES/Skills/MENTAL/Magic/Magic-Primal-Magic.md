The ancient God-Kings of Atlantis wielded vast power as they subjugated and dominated their lands. The secrets behind most of this power are long forgotten now, although a few esoteric scholars are slowly rediscovering a few of the powerful spells and abilities of this ancient tradition. This special skill is required to cast Earth Magic spells (Chapter 5). This magic is very difficult to learn (and very powerful) and so learning and improving this Special Skill costs double the normal XP to learn. Learning Primal Magic spells also costs double normal XP, and it should also be remembered that there are no teachers who can pass on either the Special Skill or new Spells. Only ancient texts can allow a Hero to learn either Special Skills or new spells.
