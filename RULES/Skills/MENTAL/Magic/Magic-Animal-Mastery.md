Some users of magic shun the world of cities and towns, of comfortable living and trade. These loners focus their talents and their magical energies on the animals of the wild, and of the natural creatures around them. A few live totally wild, sleeping under trees, whilst others build a small cottage or even tower deep in the wilderness. A specific subset of these Animal Masters are those that instead focus on the dangerous and animate plants that infest areas of Titan!
