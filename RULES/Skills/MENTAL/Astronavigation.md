# Astronavigation

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Medium, High

Space is big, even bigger than you can imagine, and travelling across it can be a difficult and daunting thing. If you have a starship, you'll want to make sure it's pointed in the right direction across a star system, a star cluster or even an entire sector of space. The Astronavigation skill makes sure that the starship gets from point A to point B, and doesn't fall into a black hole or smash into a star. 'Cause that'd end your trip real quick.
