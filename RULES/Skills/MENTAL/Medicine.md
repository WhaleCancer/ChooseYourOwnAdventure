This Special Skill allows a Hero to patch up wounds acquired in battle, treat diseases and poison and even prepare common herbs into healing poultices. In game terms, a Hero with the Healing Special Skill can restore STAMINA after a battle, and increase the STAMINA restored naturally over time. Although included in the training of physicians, herbalists and village wisemen, this Special Skill is also highly prized amongst adventurers.

The Medicine skill gives Heroes the ability to heal between... 'incidents'. From a sprained wrist to an open wound, from a headache to a disintegrated limb, you can trust him - he's a doctor.
