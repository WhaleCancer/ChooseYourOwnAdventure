# Science

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

This skill covers the knowledge of a particular branch of science of the Hero's choosing. Each branch covers both the race of the Hero and other races, so choosing Biology would also make the Hero an expert in the biological and physiological details of other known races, automatically making them a xenobiologist. Due to the need for multi-skilled scientists on missions, a Hero can choose expertise in THREE of the following scientific fields every time this Special Skill is taken at Hero Creation. Each field shares the same score that the player assigns to the Science Special Skill. Each individual scientific field within this skill must be raised separately through experience. Other fields can also be learned as the Hero advances.

## The main areas of expertise are:

- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Archaeology|Archaeology]] - Research of historical events through evidence
- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Biology|Biology]] - Study of life, living organisms, structure, evolution, and function
- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Botany|Botany]] - Study of plant life, similar to Biology
- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Chemistry|Chemistry]] - Study of matter properties and interaction
- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Ecology|Ecology]] - Study of living organism relationships with their environment
- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Geology|Geology]] - Study of worlds or planetoids, their structure, formation, and stability

- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Oceanography|Oceanography]] - Study of oceans, currents, tides, seaborne creatures, and marine ecologies
- [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Science/Physics|Physics]] - Study of matter, spacetime, energy, force, and astronomy
