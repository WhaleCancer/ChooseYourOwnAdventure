# Assess Enemy

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

This skill is distinct from "Monster Lore" skills. "Monster Lore" skills provide specific information about a monster's capabilities, vulnerabilities, resistances, habitat, ecology, and behavior. "Assess Enemy," by contrast, allows a Character to roughly gauge the combat capability of any enemy type.

The Character must observe the enemy fighting for at least one round (not necessarily against the Character) and then make a skill test. If the test fails, it cannot be reattempted during that combat. If successful, the Character will know the enemy's approximate PHYSICAL, MENTAL, and STAMINA POINTS (as detailed in the tables below) and whether it possesses a special combat bonus (e.g., modifiers to damage or armor rolls). It does not provide information on any other special abilities.
