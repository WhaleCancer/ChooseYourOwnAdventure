## Fallout (Survival)

In the wasteland, survival skills are essential for navigating irradiated deserts, finding clean water and food, avoiding deadly hazards, and making camp in the ruins. This skill covers the practical knowledge needed to thrive in the post-apocalyptic wilderness, from identifying safe water sources and edible plants to avoiding radiation hotspots and navigating by landmarks when maps are scarce or outdated. Whether tracking game, setting traps, building shelters from scrap, or recognizing the signs of dangerous weather or hostile creatures, this skill represents hard-won wasteland wisdom passed down through generations of survivors.
