# Communications

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Low, Medium, High

Picking up an off-the-shelf communicator and having a chat with a friend in the same city is easy, and even small children can do it. However, operating starship or vehicle communications systems across long distances, opening a hailing frequency with an unidentified vessel, or tracking the source of a distress signal all require specialist training. Hence this special skill!
