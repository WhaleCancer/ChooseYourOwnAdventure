This Special Skill allows a Hero to effectively run a business and make money, ranging from a smallholding to a city tavern, a thieves' guild, or a temple complex. It involves organizing workers, managing money and stock, and arranging deals. This skill is useful for Heroes investing loot into a business (honest or otherwise) and for hirelings managing the business while the owner is adventuring.
