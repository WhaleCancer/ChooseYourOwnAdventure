# Lore Skills

**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

Lore Skills cover specific areas of knowledge about the world, allowing a Character to know information related to that area. All Lore Skills use the **MENTAL** characteristic. The Director can add new Lore skills like Ancient History Lore or other specialized knowledge areas as needed.

Note that terrain-based Lore skills each cover specific natural environments. Each specialty must be taken separately, as knowledge of one terrain type does not automatically grant knowledge of others.
