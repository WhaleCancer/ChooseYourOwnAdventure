# Leadership

**Characteristic:** LUCK

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

When bargaining doesn't work, there's the simple command. The Leadership Special Skill is for those Heroes who want to take control, who want to make sure that what they want to happen happens, and to make sure that those following them obey orders. But be careful, and don't rely on this too much - one failed roll too many may turn those you were supposed to be leading against you.
