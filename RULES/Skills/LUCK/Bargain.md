# Bargain

**Characteristic:** LUCK

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

There are plenty of ways to bargain; with cash, a well-structured argument or even just a flashing smile. Not all situations call for a blaster or a punch, and talking your way out of a problem can lead to a much calmer resolution, with no need for all that shouting and expensive medical attention nonsense. The Bargain skill helps players negotiate, communicate and hopefully - get a better deal out of the situation.
