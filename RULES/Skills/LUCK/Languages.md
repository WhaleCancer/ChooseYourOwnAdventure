# Languages

**Characteristic:** LUCK

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

Many science fiction settings use universal translators to help different races communicate, or by some amazing turn of luck it just so happens that most species speak English, but it's assumed that all Heroes begin with the ability to read and write the common language. But, for those Heroes who want to expand their linguistic skills, for every point they put into the Language Special Skill, they can speak and read one extra language of their choice.
