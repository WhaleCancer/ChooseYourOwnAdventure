**Characteristic:** MENTAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

A Hero finds a derelict spaceship floating in space. It can easily be salvaged and taken to the nearest starport, but what is it worth? How about that large pile of robot parts found at the enemy base? What about those data chips? This special skill allows a character to have a good guess at the value of almost anything on the open market, although without appropriate information it is only likely to be a rough guess.
