# Polearms

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic

This skill covers the use of spears, halberds, lances, and poleaxes, and should be added to a Character's combat total if using one of these weapons.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill covers traditional polearms including spears, halberds, lances, and poleaxes made from wood and metal. Characters can use spears for thrusting attacks and throwing, halberds for versatile combat combining axe and spear techniques, lances for mounted combat, and poleaxes for powerful strikes. This includes understanding traditional polearm techniques, maintaining simple polearm equipment, and using these weapons effectively in formation combat and individual duels. Polearms are valued for their reach advantage, ability to keep enemies at distance, and effectiveness in formation fighting. Polearms are particularly favored by professional soldiers and pikemen for formation warfare, knights and cavalry for mounted combat with lances, and guards and sentries who need weapons with reach advantage to control access points and defend positions. As technology advances and firearms become more common, polearms become less practical for combat, though they may still be used for ceremonial purposes, historical reenactments, or in specific cultural contexts.
