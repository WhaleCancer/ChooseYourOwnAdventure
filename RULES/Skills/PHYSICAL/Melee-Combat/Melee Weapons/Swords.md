# Swords

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic

This skill covers the use of shortswords, broadswords, and two-handed swords, and should be added to a Character's combat total if using one of these weapons.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill covers traditional swords including shortswords, broadswords, and two-handed swords made from bronze or iron. Characters can use shortswords for quick, agile combat, broadswords for versatile melee fighting, and two-handed swords for powerful strikes. This includes understanding traditional sword techniques, maintaining simple sword equipment, and using these weapons effectively in both individual duels and battlefield combat. Swords are valued for their versatility, balance between offense and defense, and status as symbols of authority and skill. Swords are particularly favored by knights and nobles for their prestige and effectiveness in combat, professional soldiers and warriors who rely on swords as primary weapons, and duelists and fencers who value the art and skill of swordplay. As technology advances and firearms become more common, swords become less practical for combat, though they may still be used for ceremonial purposes, historical reenactments, or in specific cultural contexts.
