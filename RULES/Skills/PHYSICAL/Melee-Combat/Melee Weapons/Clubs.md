# Clubs

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low

This skill covers the use of clubs, maces and hammers, and should be added to a Character's combat total if using one of these weapons.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill covers traditional clubs, maces, and hammers made from wood, stone, or metal. Characters can use simple clubs for basic combat, war hammers for armored opponents, and maces for crushing attacks. This includes understanding traditional bludgeoning weapon techniques, maintaining simple club equipment, and using these weapons effectively in melee combat. Clubs, maces, and hammers are valued for their ability to deliver crushing damage and are particularly effective against armored opponents. Clubs are particularly favored by orcs and goblins for their simplicity and raw power, common soldiers and guards who need reliable weapons, and peasants and commoners who can easily craft or find club-like weapons for self-defense.

At **Low** tech levels, this skill primarily covers improvised bludgeoning weapons such as baseball bats, tire irons, pipes, crowbars, and other common objects that can be used as clubs. Characters can effectively use almost any heavy, blunt object as a weapon, applying their knowledge of bludgeoning techniques to improvised tools. The modern purpose-built weapons at this tech level include telescoping batons (expandable batons), riot batons, and shock batons (stun batons) used by law enforcement. This includes understanding how to effectively use improvised weapons, recognizing what objects make good clubs, and working with modern police equipment. While firearms become more common at this tech level, clubs remain useful for close combat, crowd control, and situations where weapons need to be improvised or concealed. The skill maintains relevance for melee combat, law enforcement operations, and environments where non-lethal or less-lethal force is preferred. At Low tech levels, clubs and similar weapons are commonly used by police and law enforcement (with purpose-built batons) for crowd control and non-lethal takedowns, criminals and street fighters who rely on improvised weapons, security personnel for facility protection, riot control units for managing civil disturbances, and civilians who need to defend themselves with whatever is available.
