# Staves

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic

This skill covers the use of a staff, and should be added to a Character's combat total if using this weapon.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill covers traditional wooden staves used for combat and defense. Characters can use simple staves made from wood or other natural materials. This includes understanding traditional staff fighting techniques, maintaining simple staff equipment, and using staves effectively in melee combat. Staves are versatile weapons that can be used for both offense and defense, and are valued for their simplicity and effectiveness. As technology advances and firearms become more common, staves become less practical for combat, though they may still be used for ceremonial purposes or in specific cultural contexts. Staves are particularly favored by monks and martial artists for their defensive capabilities and connection to disciplined combat, wizards and scholars who use staves as both weapons and symbols of authority, and travelers and pilgrims who value staves as walking sticks that can double as weapons for self-defense.
