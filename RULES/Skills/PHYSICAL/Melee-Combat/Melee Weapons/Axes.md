# Axes

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low

This skill covers the use of all axes, from small hatchets up to huge two-handed battleaxes, and should be added to a Character's combat total if wielding one of these weapons.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill covers traditional axes made from stone, bronze, or iron. Characters can use small hatchets for utility work, hand axes for combat, and large two-handed battleaxes for warfare. This includes understanding traditional axe techniques, maintaining simple axe equipment, and using axes effectively in both combat and utility situations. Axes are essential tools and weapons, valued for their versatility in both warfare and daily tasks. The skill covers all aspects of using these weapons effectively, from throwing axes to wielding massive two-handed battleaxes in melee combat. Axes are particularly favored by barbarians for their raw power and effectiveness in close combat, and by dwarves who value axes both as weapons and as essential tools for mining and crafting.

At **Low** tech levels, this skill expands to include modern axes with improved materials like steel alloys and advanced manufacturing techniques. Characters can work with modern hatchets, combat axes, and advanced battleaxes. This includes understanding modern axe combat techniques and working with improved weapon designs. While firearms become more common at this tech level, axes remain useful for close combat, utility work, and specialized situations. The skill maintains relevance for melee combat, survival situations, and environments where traditional weapons are preferred or necessary. Modern axes may have improved balance, durability, and specialized designs for combat or utility purposes. At Low tech levels, axes are commonly used by firefighters for forcible entry and rescue operations, SWAT teams and tactical units for breaching doors and barriers, emergency responders for disaster relief, survivalists and outdoorsmen for wilderness tasks, and military units for specialized combat and utility operations.
