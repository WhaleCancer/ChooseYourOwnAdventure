# Dodge

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

Armour is very useful when in a firefight with enemy troopers, but many prefer to avoid getting hit in the first place. This special skill can allow a Hero to reduce or even avoid damage altogether by the simple expedient of not being where the shot is aimed!
