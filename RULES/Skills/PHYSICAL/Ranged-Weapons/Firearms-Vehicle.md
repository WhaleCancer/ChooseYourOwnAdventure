## Stellar Adventures (CB77011, Page 11) [Page 0011](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0011.png)

Not all weapons can be hefted, some have to be mounted to a vehicle, and this skill allows a Hero to use them. Whether it's a cannon mounted to a truck in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a weapon under the wings of a scramjet fighter or a turret on a base, this skill gives you a much better chance.

## Fallout (Vehicle Weapons)

Vehicle-specific weapons found in the wasteland require specialized training to operate effectively. This skill covers integrated weapons built into vehicles, such as cannons on armored vehicles. Portable weapons like machine guns or miniguns used by soldiers on vehicles still use their respective weapon skills (Firearms-Light or Firearms-Heavy), not this skill. When operating vehicle-integrated weapons, this skill improves your chances of hitting.

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy (Siege Weapons) (Heroes Companion, Page 10) [Page 0010](../../../../AFF005_Heroes_Companion_Pages/page_0010.png)

This Special Skill is used to operate, aim, and fire siege weapons like bolt throwers, catapults, rams, and trebuchets. A Hero with this skill cannot construct these weapons but can perform routine maintenance. Skilled Siege Weapon operators are in high demand in armies due to their importance in breaking fortifications. Siege weapons operate at the vehicle scale, as these weapons are often vehicles themselves or mounted on vehicles, requiring similar handling and operation skills as other vehicle-mounted weapons.

## Related Skills

This general skill relates to the following specialized vehicle weapon skills:
- **[[Firearms-Vehicle/Vehicle-Ballistic]]** - Vehicle-mounted ballistic weapons including cannons and machine guns
- **[[Firearms-Vehicle/Vehicle-Energy]]** - Vehicle-mounted energy weapons including laser cannons and plasma weapons
- **[[Firearms-Vehicle/Vehicle-Missile]]** - Vehicle-mounted missile and rocket weapons including missile launchers and rocket pods

If rules reference any of these specialized skills but your campaign uses the general Firearms-Vehicle skill instead, simply substitute Firearms-Vehicle for the specialized skill reference.

> **Note:** Firearms - Vehicle weapons operate at the vehicle level which do double damage against the normal person level and half damage against the starship level. This is the primary distinction of this skill, and certain things like manned turrets may also use this skill.
