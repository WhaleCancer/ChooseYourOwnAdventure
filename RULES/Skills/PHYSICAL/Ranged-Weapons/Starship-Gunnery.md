Firing a weapon in the vastness of space at a small craft traveling very very fast takes some skill and training to be successful. And this skill is it. Launching missiles or firing a ship's laser both use this special skill.

Operating shipboard weapons requires accounting for the motion of your own vessel, the target's movement, wind, and sea conditions. This special skill covers firing naval guns, launching missiles, and operating torpedo systems from a ship at sea.

## Star Trek

Operating a starship's weapons while both vessels maneuver at warp or in tactical situations requires skill and training. This skill covers firing phasers and launching photon torpedoes from a Starfleet vessel.
