# Bows

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low

This skill covers the use of longbows, shortbows and crossbows, and should be added to a Character's combat total if using one of these weapons.

At **Basic** tech levels, this skill covers traditional archery using longbows, shortbows, and basic crossbows. Characters can use wooden bows with natural materials like sinew strings and wooden or bone arrows. This includes understanding traditional archery techniques, maintaining simple bow equipment, and crafting basic arrows. Bows are essential hunting and combat weapons, and skilled archers are highly valued. The skill covers all aspects of using these weapons effectively in combat and hunting situations. Bows are particularly favored by elves for their precision and connection to nature, rangers and scouts for silent hunting and reconnaissance, and hunters and woodsmen who rely on archery for survival and providing food.

At **Low** tech levels, this skill expands to include modern compound bows, advanced crossbows, and improved arrow technology. Characters can work with modern materials like fiberglass, carbon fiber, and metal components. This includes understanding modern archery techniques, using advanced sighting systems, and working with improved ammunition. While firearms become more common at this tech level, bows remain useful for silent hunting, specialized combat situations, and in environments where firearms may not be practical. The skill maintains relevance for stealth operations and situations where traditional weapons are preferred. At Low tech levels, bows are commonly used by special forces and military units for silent operations, survivalists and preppers for hunting and self-defense, competitive archers and sport hunters, and law enforcement in situations requiring non-lethal or silent takedowns.
