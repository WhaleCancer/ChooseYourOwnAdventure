## Stellar Adventures (CB77011, Page 11) [Page 0011](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0011.png)

Covering light pistols and rifles, the Firearms - Light special skill gives the Hero a much better chance of bulls-eyeing that target. If it shoots needles, bullets, balls of yellow light or beams of explosive energy, and you can hold it in one hand or put it to your shoulder, then this skill improves your chances of hitting.

## Fallout (Small Guns)

Small Guns covers light firearms found in the wasteland, from 10mm pistols and hunting rifles to laser pistols and plasma rifles. Whether it shoots bullets or energy beams, if you can hold it in one hand or put it to your shoulder, this skill improves your chances of hitting. Unlike the Fallout computer games where Small Guns and Energy Weapons are separate skills, here they are combined to match the Stellar Adventures approach.
