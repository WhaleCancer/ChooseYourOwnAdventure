## Stellar Adventures (CB77011, Page 10) [Page 0010](../../../../CB77011_stellar-adventures_Pages/page_0010.png)

Conflict is inevitable, and sometimes it gets big, so this special skill covers the use of large weapons, such as rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, heavy lasers and anything else that inflicts a lot of damage and needs to be hefted by the user due to its size and weight. Basically, if the weapon is bigger than you are, it's a heavy weapon.

## Fallout (Big Guns)

Big Guns covers heavy weapons found in the wasteland, from miniguns and rocket launchers to flamethrowers and gatling lasers. Whether it's a multibarrel weapon, explosive launcher, or heavy energy weapon, if it requires significant strength and training to operate effectively, this skill improves your chances of hitting. Unlike the Fallout computer games where Big Guns and Energy Weapons are sometimes separate, here heavy energy weapons are included to match the Stellar Adventures approach.
