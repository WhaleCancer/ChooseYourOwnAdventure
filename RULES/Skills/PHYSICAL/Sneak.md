**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

## Stellar Adventures (Page 12)

From moving silently from one location another, to keeping quiet and still in the shadows, to creeping up behind an unsuspecting enemy with barely a whisper and a big stick, the Sneak skill keeps Heroes out of sight, out of mind and – hopefully – out of trouble.

## Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Ed (Page 29)

This Skill is used to avoid being seen or heard. A Hero can camouflage himself, hide in a shadow, or move silently past a sleeping guard. Noisy armour will render this Skill almost worthless.
