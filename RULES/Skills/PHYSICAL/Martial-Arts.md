## Combat Companion (Page 11)

This combat Special Skill allows a Hero to use their fists, feet, elbows, knees and even heads as deadly weapons. Although there is a little crossover with Brawling, this Special Skill is highly formalised, with specific moves, attacks and stances. Unlike other attacks, this "weapon" inflicts greater damage as the martial artist increases their rank. A Hero attacking with this special skill may not wear metal armour or use a shield due to the restriction in movement.
