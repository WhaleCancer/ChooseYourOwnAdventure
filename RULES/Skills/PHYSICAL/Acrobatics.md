Need to leap that gap? Twist out of the way of that falling support strut? Perhaps you have some zero-gravity work to do and you want that extra peace of mind, that ability to keep yourself upright in a universe with no 'up'. The Acrobatics skill enables Heroes to make short work of climbing, tightropes and swinging across chasms with a friend in their arms.

This Special Skill covers many situations involving balance and agility. Walking a tightrope, swinging on a rope, arresting a fall and performing a somersault would all be covered.
