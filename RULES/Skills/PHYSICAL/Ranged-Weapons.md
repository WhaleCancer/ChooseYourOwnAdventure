# Ranged Weapons

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

The Ranged Weapons special skill represents general proficiency with all types of ranged weapons, including both firearm and non-firearm missile weapons. This skill covers ranged attacks at all scales of the game: personal scale (light and heavy weapons, as well as missile weapons like bows and thrown weapons), vehicle scale (vehicle-mounted weapons), and starship scale (starship-mounted weapons). This skill also covers ranged attacks across all tech levels, from basic bows and thrown weapons to advanced energy weapons and starship weaponry. In campaigns that use only this general skill instead of specialized weapon skills, this is the only skill available for ranged attacks, though talents may provide bonuses to specific specialized weapon types regardless.
