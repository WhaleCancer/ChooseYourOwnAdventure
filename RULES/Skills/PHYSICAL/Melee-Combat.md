# Melee Combat

**Characteristic:** PHYSICAL

**Tech Levels:** Basic, Low, Medium, High

The Melee Combat special skill represents general proficiency with all types of close combat. This skill covers unarmed combat, improvised weapons, and melee weapons. In campaigns that use only this general skill instead of specialized melee combat skills, this is the only skill available for close combat, though talents may provide bonuses to specific specialized combat types regardless.

## Related Skills

This general skill relates to the following specialized melee combat skills:
- **[[Melee-Weapons]]** - Melee weapons including axes, clubs, polearms, staves, and swords
- **[[Brawling]]** - Unarmed combat and improvised weapons

If rules reference any of these specialized skills but your campaign uses the general Melee Combat skill instead, simply substitute Melee Combat for the specialized skill reference.
