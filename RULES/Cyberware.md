## Cyberware

In EPIC, cyberware means **artificial body parts and embedded systems**—everything from replacement limbs to wired‑in reflex boosters and under‑skin armour. In 1985 British Columbia this technology is not something you buy at the mall, but it is **visible enough to make the news**: magazine spreads on “bionic heroes,” talk‑show segments with experimental patients, and the occasional police press conference about a “cybernetic officer” or “rehabilitated veteran.” Scattered **black clinics, military research projects, and programs built on recovered alien craft** have pushed human medicine a decade or two ahead of where it should be, just in very specific directions.

Conspiracy broadcasters, occult groups, and burned‑out insiders talk about a hidden **Ascension Programme**: a project run by breakaway technocrats who want to **merge human beings with machines** and with something that might not be entirely human intelligence. On paper it is about saving lives, ending disability, and making “the next step in human evolution.” In practice, it looks a lot like building a controllable, post‑human underclass and a tiny, almost untouchable cybernetic elite.

For most citizens, cybernetics are something that happens **to other people**—soldiers on the evening news, factory accidents in lurid tabloid stories, celebrities rumoured to have secret work done. They know it exists, but will likely go their whole lives without meeting someone openly augmented. For player characters it is possible, but dangerous, expensive, and permanently life‑changing.

## Installing Cyberware

- **Access**: Cyberware requires a **specialist surgical team** with access to experimental hardware, alien‑derived materials, or both. This usually means:  
  - Classified military hospitals and off‑the‑books government facilities.  
  - Criminal “back‑room” surgeons with stolen tech.  
  - Occult‑adjacent groups who have secretly acquired alien biotech.
- **Recovery**: Major implants require **weeks or months** of recuperation, physiotherapy, and psychological adjustment.
- **Luck cost**: Once installed, each separate cyberware component **permanently reduces the character’s LUCK** (see table). This represents reduced margin for freak survival, accidents, and “the universe cutting you a break.”  
- **Irreversible**: Removing cyberware is possible in theory, but in practice it is extremely rare, expensive, and risky.

Cyberware may be obvious chrome, discreet surgical work, or almost undetectable alien grafts, depending on the item and the clinic.

## Cyberware Summary

Use 1985 CAD costs (see `Money`) as baseline surgical + hardware prices. Black‑market or off‑book military work may charge **1.5–3×** these amounts, or demand favours instead of cash.

## Cyberware Descriptions

### Replacement Arm

A mechanical or bio‑synthetic arm anchored to the shoulder, designed to replace a lost limb or, in some programs, “upgrade” a healthy one. The limb is stronger and faster than flesh and bone, granting **+1 to all attempts to grab, hold, climb, or perform Melee / Strength tests with that arm**.  
It can incorporate obvious chrome or be built to appear nearly natural, at additional cost.

### Replacement Leg

A reinforced leg that restores or enhances mobility. A character with one replacement leg gains **+1 to running, sprinting, and jumping tests**; with **two replacement legs**, apply a **+3** instead. Falls and landings may also be treated more leniently at the Director’s discretion.

### Replacement Eye and Upgrades

The basic cyber‑eye restores normal sight to a blinded or missing eye using advanced optics and alien‑inspired sensor arrays. On its own it has **no LUCK cost** beyond surgery risk.  
The eye can be upgraded with **night‑vision, zoom, image capture, and data overlay** functions. With these enhancements, the eye grants **+2 to Awareness** in low light, surveillance, or long‑range spotting, and may host a **Targetlink**, providing **+1 to ranged attack totals**.

### Wired Reflexes

This system overlays or partially replaces the character’s nervous system with high‑speed synthetic pathways. Benefits:

- The character **cannot be surprised** in ordinary circumstances, acting normally even during ambushes.  
- Once per round they may declare a **Fast Shot**: they act as if they had taken a speed penalty (e.g., a “Rapid Shot”) but without the usual full Skill penalty. Apply a reduced penalty instead, as agreed with the Director.

Side‑effects include tremors, sleep problems, and a subtle alien “feel” to movement that some NPCs may notice.

### Datalink

A cranial or spinal interface that connects directly to computers, radios, or specialised devices via cable or short‑range wireless. The character gains **+2 to relevant Computer, Electronics, or Systems tests** when jacked in and may operate compatible equipment hands‑free. Military and intelligence agencies consider uncontrolled datalinks a serious security risk.

### Skill Card Slot

A socketed implant that allows a character to use **skill cards**—encoded chips or alien memory crystals. Each card provides access to a specific special skill at a pre‑set rating (for example, a new skill at 1–3).  
Loading a card takes a short time; until it initialises, the skill cannot be used. Higher‑rated, rarer cards are more expensive and are prime targets for theft or espionage.

### AutoMedKit

An internal med‑kit reservoir under the skin or between ribs. When triggered (by thought, switch, or remote signal), it releases a carefully measured cocktail of drugs and clotting agents.  
The character makes a **SKILL or Medical test**; on success they **restore 4 STAMINA**, and on a critical success **restore 8 STAMINA**. The kit cannot critically fail its own injection, but once used it must be refilled at a clinic or medbay before it can function again.

### Subdermal Armour

Armour plates or dense fibres implanted under the skin over much of the torso and limbs. To casual inspection it is invisible; a trained medic or scanner may detect it.  
The character is treated as wearing **Guard / Armoured Clothes** for protection (see `Armour`) even when apparently unarmoured, and does **not** need the usual Armour skill requirement for that level of protection. If heavier armour is worn over it, the Director may grant **+1 column** on the protection track.

### Embedded Communicator

A tiny transceiver implanted near the jaw, ear, or throat. It allows **short‑range, nearly silent communication** with compatible radios or other implanted units. Speech can be no more than slight lip movements or subvocalisation; incoming audio feeds directly to the auditory nerves.

### Integral Blades

Retractable blades concealed in the forearms or hands, triggered by a subdermal button or specific muscle movement. In combat they function as a **Sword‑class melee weapon**, and the character gains **+1 to attack totals** when using them. When retracted they are difficult to detect without scanners or a close physical search.

### Integral Firearm

A compact firearm integrated into an arm or prosthetic. It must be small (typically pistol calibre) and holds **only one or two shots** before requiring a complex reload.  
It does **not** gain a separate attack bonus, but is extremely hard to detect and ideal for assassins or undercover operatives. The cost of the cyberware **does not include the weapon itself**, which must be purchased separately and may be custom‑built.

### Stimpack Implant

An internal injector full of powerful stimulants and alien‑derived compounds. When activated, it floods the character’s system, pushing them toward **near‑superhuman speed** for a brief time.  
For one combat, the character may **act twice per round** (or an equivalent benefit in your system), but afterwards suffers heavy fatigue and potential medical complications. The implant normally stores **1–3 doses**; each use requires a medical test or downtime to safely reload.

The Director should use Stimpack implants sparingly—they are dramatic, cinematic, and dangerous, and heavy reliance on them can justify long‑term health problems, addiction, or strange alien side‑effects.

### Cybernetic Chassis

This is not a single limb or implant but a **full or near‑full body conversion**: reinforced skeleton, artificial organs, composite armour plating, and actuators throughout the frame. What is left of the original body is entombed inside a walking armoured shell.

- The character is treated as wearing the equivalent of **Heavy Battle Armour** at all times (see `Armour`), with Encumbrance **Large**.  
- They gain **+1 PHYSICAL** for lifting, breaking, and other brute‑force tests.  
- They no longer suffer most penalties from missing limbs or many crippling injuries; however, repair requires **specialist workshops**, not ordinary hospitals.

Drawbacks: the character is obviously not “normal” unless heavily disguised, requires regular maintenance, and is usually **contractually owned** by whichever agency paid for the conversion (police, military, corporation, or worse).

### Tactical HUD & Recorder

An integrated **heads‑up display**, threat analyser, and encrypted audio‑visual recorder wired directly to the character’s optics and auditory nerves. It overlays targeting data, highlights threats and wanted faces, and records everything from the character’s point of view.

- Grants **+1 to Awareness tests** to spot weapons, ambushes, or known suspects in crowds.  
- When combined with a Targetlink or upgraded eye, the HUD grants an additional **+1 to attack rolls** against targets it has time to track (not in pure snap‑fire situations).  
- Recordings provide strong evidence: when used in court hearings or internal affairs inquiries, they grant a significant bonus on relevant **Law, Bureaucracy, or Persuasion** checks.

Drawbacks: authorities or handlers may **subpoena, hack, or remotely access** the feed, and some black‑clinic versions include “dead‑man” broadcast functions that dump footage if the user goes offline.

### Pain Editor

A cluster of implants that intercept and dampen pain signals, emotional spikes, and stress responses, allowing the character to fight on through horrific damage.

- While the Pain Editor is active, the character **ignores penalties from wounds, shock, and fear**.  
- They may continue acting normally at **0 STAMINA**, but each round must make a **Body/Constitution test**; on failure they immediately collapse as all stored trauma hits at once.

Long‑term use can cause emotional blunting, explosive outbursts when the editor is offline, or disturbing detachment from human suffering.

### Directive Chip

An implanted control module carrying **hard‑coded directives** and priority rules: who counts as a “civilian,” which agencies must be obeyed, what cannot be targeted except under extreme conditions.

- Grants a bonus on resisting **bribery, intimidation, and some forms of mental influence**, representing rigid conditioning and prioritisation.  
- However, the chip can also **forbid certain actions** (for example, firing on specific uniforms, harming registered “civilians,” or disobeying direct orders from a designated handler) unless the character undergoes illegal reprogramming or catastrophic trauma.

Directive Chips are the reason some cyber‑enhanced operatives feel more like **property** than people, and they provide GMs with hooks for conflicts over free will, overrides, and secret “fourth directives.”

### Gyro‑Stabiliser Harness

Heavy torsion bars, gyros, and reinforcement struts anchored into the spine and hips. This hardware is designed so the user can **brace heavy weapons with their whole body**.

- When firing **Light Machine Guns or GPMGs**, the user may ignore the usual **‑2 Skill penalty for moving and firing** and treat the weapon as if it had one Encumbrance step lower for purposes of bracing.  
- Hyperfire with heavy weapons becomes less risky; the Director may allow rerolls of certain malfunction checks or reduce recoil penalties.

Drawbacks include bulk (always Encumbrance **Large**), noisy servo whine at speed, and obvious mechanical bulk under clothing, making subtle work much harder.

### Failsafe Kill‑Switch Core

Hidden deep in the torso or brainstem, this device is a **corporate or government dead‑man switch**: a shaped charge, neural burn‑out grid, or alien failsafe that can be triggered remotely if the subject goes rogue.

- Grants a small narrative bonus when resisting **certain forms of mental domination**—the host knows that going fully out of control could trigger their own destruction.  
- Allows handlers to threaten or actually trigger **instant incapacitation or death** if strict conditions are violated.

The Kill‑Switch is almost never offered to free citizens; it is imposed on **test subjects, black‑ops operatives, and resurrected assets** as part of their contract.

### Tracked Lower Chassis

Inspired by military prototypes and B‑movie “mandroids,” this system replaces or augments the legs with a **detachable tracked base**.

- While the treads are attached the character gains **increased movement speed**, improved stability, and a higher **encumbrance capacity** (the Director may allow several extra Normal items).  
- Rough terrain, snow, and logging roads are treated as easier ground, but **stairs, tight interiors, and stealth** become serious problems.

Switching between legs and treads takes specialised tools and time; some operators never remove the chassis, trading humanity for sheer battlefield presence.

### Runaway Enforcement Protocol (REP Chip)

An experimental **law‑enforcement AI** burned into a control chip. The REP constantly evaluates threats and “criminality,” and can partially seize the host’s motor functions when the law is being broken.

- Provides bonuses to **tracking, target acquisition, and intimidation** against flagged offenders.  
- In stressful scenes the Director may call for REP checks; on failure the chip may **force the character toward lethal escalation, arrest attempts, or uncompromising pursuit**, even when that is tactically unwise.

Black clinics sometimes install hacked REP Chips into bounty hunters or vigilantes; official agencies prefer not to admit they exist at all.

### Patchwork Resurrection Matrix

A crude neural lattice used to drag a clinically dead or brain‑destroyed subject back into a kind of life. The Matrix stitches surviving memories to artificial patterns, producing something **part person, part machine**.

- Allows an important NPC or PC to return from death with **partial amnesia, emotional glitches, and occasional involuntary behaviour**.  
- Mechanically, the character may gain bonuses to ignore fear or pain, but suffers penalties to **social rolls, empathy, or memory checks** when the Matrix misfires.

Most jurisdictions would consider the Matrix unethical or outright illegal, so installations are hidden in basements, foreign clinics, or corporate black sites.

### Spinal Data Vault Courier Core

This hardened memory core is fused to the host’s spine and nervous system, turning them into a **living data courier**.

- Holds encrypted corporate, military, or alien data that can only be accessed with specialised hardware or by physically capturing the body.  
- Grants strong bonuses when bargaining with factions that want the data, or when resisting attempts to coerce disclosure without extraction.

The vault is resistant to EMP and routine surgery; removal is lethal without precise procedures. Many couriers do not even know **what** they are carrying—only that everyone hunting them is willing to spill a lot of blood to get it.

### Ascension Uplink Node

A crown of hidden implants and deep‑brain electrodes that tunes the user into an **off‑books machine network**—part classified mainframe cluster, part something stranger built from recovered alien logic. Technicians sell it as the first step toward “joining a higher consciousness.”

- When interfacing with **AIs, advanced computers, or alien‑derived tech**, the user gains **+2 to relevant mental or technical tests** and may communicate with such systems silently.  
- During severe stress or sleep, the Director may choose to feed the character **visions, commands, or data** from the Uplink that may or may not be truthful.

The Node blurs the line between inspiration and outside control; some users come to believe the network is literally a god, while others fight to keep their own thoughts separate from the incoming signal.

### Hive Relay Antenna

An array of subdermal antennas and spine‑mounted repeaters that lets multiple augmented operatives share **tactical data, emotional states, and target priorities**.

- Teams linked through Hive Relays gain a small bonus when **coordinating actions, maintaining formation, or sharing Awareness checks**.  
- The Director can also treat them as having a limited **telepathic chat** within a short range, useful for silent operations.

At higher bandwidths the distinction between “teamwork” and **hive‑mind conditioning** gets thin. Long‑term users sometimes report hearing orders from no one in the room.

### Ghost Mirror Backup

A highly experimental system that runs a **partial copy of the user’s neural patterns** on hidden storage, updating whenever they sleep or undergo maintenance.

- Once per campaign (or at the Director’s discretion), if the character dies or suffers brain death, the Ghost Mirror may allow a form of **return**: either by rebuilding a damaged brain or booting the pattern into a fresh cybernetic body.  
- The restored character may have **gaps in memory, altered personality traits, or occasional “echoes”** of prior iterations.

Religious and occult communities argue violently over whether the Ghost Mirror preserves the soul or merely animates a **very convincing puppet**.

### Puppet Override Harness

An invasive spine and limb harness wired for **remote neuromuscular control**. Officially it exists to let trainers or technicians assist a recovering patient; unofficially it is a way for handlers to pilot a cyborg like a drone.

- When voluntarily linked to a trusted operator, the Harness can grant a bonus to **complex physical tasks** (synchronised fire, parkour, vehicle operation).  
- In hostile hands it allows a remote user to **override the subject’s actions**; resisting requires repeated Willpower or LUCK tests, and failure can leave the character watching their own body commit acts they would never choose.

The Harness is the clearest example of cyberware as **enslavement rather than enhancement**, and most free clinics refuse to install it at any price.

### Mark‑of‑Grid Sigil

A small, almost decorative implant—often a corporate logo, barcode, or abstract symbol—containing **biometric ID, cashless payment credentials, and health/behavioural telemetry**.

- Holders breeze through security gates, cashless transactions, and medical systems, gaining bonuses to **bureaucratic, financial, or travel‑related rolls** in areas where the Grid is trusted.  
- At the same time, every use updates a central ledger with their **location, purchases, associates, and biometric state**.

Many citizens are given subsidised Sigils as part of “modernisation” or welfare programmes. Conspiracy circles whisper that this is the opening layer of a **total control grid**—the soft, smiling face of the same Ascension Programme that puts crowns of metal inside people’s skulls.

## Cyberware Research and the X‑Com Phase

In the early part of the campaign, most of this catalogue exists only as **rumours, case files, and classified photographs**. Once the game shifts into an X‑Com‑style phase, the Characters gain access to labs, captured hardware, and living (or not‑quite‑living) subjects from the **Ascension factions**.

- **Research projects**:  
  - Each major cyberware entry can be treated as a **research topic** unlocked by recovering appropriate evidence: captured operatives, recovered implants, stolen design files, or cooperation from sympathetic insiders.  
  - Completing a project moves an item from “rumour” to **field‑deployable**, allowing it to be installed on PCs, allies, or custom NPCs.
- **Cost and risk**:  
  - Even after research, the 1985 Canadian cost and LUCK penalties still apply.  
  - Early prototypes may impose **extra drawbacks** (glitches, side‑effects, maintenance demands) until further refinement is researched.
- **Moral choice**:  
  - Using cyberware means **borrowing tools from the same inhuman logic** the Ascension Programme serves. PCs who adopt these implants gain undeniable power, but also risk dehumanisation, spiritual compromise, or sliding into the same breakaway mindset as their enemies.  
  - Psionic powers gained from studying alien entities create a parallel path: one rooted in hostile otherworldly minds, the other in human technocracy. Directors are encouraged to **play these paths against each other**, forcing the group to decide how far they are willing to go, and which kind of corruption they fear more.

By the time the Characters are fielding cybernetic commandos and psionic agents, they should be uncomfortably aware that they are walking the same road as their enemies—just hoping they can stop before the point of no return.
