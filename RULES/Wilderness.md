# Wilderness

## Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to provide you, as either Characters or Game Masters, with the means of creating interesting and challenging wilderness environments. These rules can be used with a map that you have already created, or help you create one.

As with the sections on settlements and dungeons, it is advised that you consider the results of the tables as suggestions for your game and alter them to suit your needs.

In a world of adventure, the wilds are a truly dangerous place.

Roads and tracks may be known to locals but will lead travellers astray. Maps are hard to obtain and unreliable.

Help for wanderers, in the form of shelters or inns, is sparse or non-existent and all the while you may feel the hairs on the back of your neck prickling as a wily beast or ruthless bandit tracks your steps.

Even should you find your way and avoid confrontation, a great storm can sweep across and freeze you to the bone. If the cities and towns are dangerous, the wilds are deadly.

To survive your adventures across Titan you will need to find your way, deal with your encounters and be prepared for the ever changing weather.

### A note on Skills

Throughout this section the ‘Region Lore’ skill will be referenced extensively. In the Advanced Fighting Fantasy core rulebook only two types of Region Lore are referenced - Forest Lore and Sea Lore are specified, but any type of environment can have its own skill. Thus the full list (for the purposes of this book, you may add your own as required) are Plains Lore, Forest Lore, Hills Lore, Mountain Lore, Tundra & Ice Lore, Desert Lore, Jungle Lore, Marsh Lore,

Rivers & Lakes Lore, Shorelines and Sea Lore. This is quite a long list of skills! At the discretion of the Game Master, you can substitute a single skill ‘Wilderness Lore’ which covers all of these.

In addition, remember that these are knowledge Skills - a Character can still use SKILL or MAGIC to attempt the tests - the points in the Skill makes it more likely you will succeed, but an experienced barbarian or sorcerer will be able to cope with most challenges without developing all these Skills separately.

For the purposes of this book, each Region Lore skill covers a type of environment rather than a particular place. A Character with three points in Marsh Lore can use this skill in any marsh they come across. You may prefer the idea that Region Lore refers to a particular area, if so Characters must make a note of which part of the world they are familiar with when they learn the skill.

### Using the Characters Companion Rules

The Advanced Fighting Fantasy Characters Companion book provides rules on creating maps for wilderness areas, if the player or Game Master prefers to use these rules they should do so; the tables for weather, terrain and encounters from this book can then be used to enhance the use of these maps.

## Creating your Wilderness

See [[RULES/Wilderness/Creating-Wilderness|Creating Wilderness]] for detailed rules on creating wilderness maps, including map creation methods, random landscape generation, and tables for wilderness generation.

## Travelling the Wilds

See [[RULES/Wilderness/Traveling-Wilderness|Traveling Wilderness]] for detailed rules on traveling through the wilderness, including travel time, encounters, foraging, exposure, and survival.

## Environment Descriptions

See [[RULES/Wilderness/Environment-Descriptions|Environment Descriptions]] for detailed descriptions of each environment type, including route tables, weather conditions, terrain, and encounter tables.

## Wilderness Encounters

Travelling through the wilderness should mean more than simply bumping into wandering monsters (though that should happen occasionally). These encounters aim to bring the wilds to life by offering more than just random combat.

## Unusual Locations & Themes

The rules presented thus far cover many standard locations and environments of the sort that you might find in most fantasy settings, but there are an endless number of places that can be added to customise your world and adventures. There simply isn't enough space to cover them all properly though the mechanics and tables provided in this book can be used as templates to be modified as you see fit. You can change the encounters, add your own, alter things like the weather conditions, the number of encounters per day and the chances of getting a hostile encounter compared to meeting someone that just wishes to talk.

If you are using a place in passing you can try to modify the tables as you go but if you are creating an environment you intend to use frequently (for example, the heart of your campaign takes place in a chaos infested land of hills and plains which your Characters will traverse many times) it can be a better idea to write up your modifications and altered encounter tables in full for your own reference.

Some examples of different locations and environments are given here, with ideas as to how you might want to modify the ruleset. The more effort you put into customising the map and encounter tables, the more unusual and memorable your environment will be!
