# Chapter 9 - Villains

What would a hero be without a villain to defeat? In this chapter we present a number of archetypes of villainy to use, which we will call your opponent. In general it is assumed you have one opponent at a time, though you can take on more if you are up to the challenge.

Your opponent will initially be unaware of you and will try to escape confrontation, so you will need to force the encounter.

In addition to the example villains, this chapter offers a way to randomly generate dastardly evildoers. Look through the list for ideas and add your own twists.

## 9.1 Example Villains

Twelve example villains are provided to give you a range of opponents. These villains are divided into three for each of four 'domains': 'Winds of Magic', 'Fury of the Gods', 'Chaos Unleashed', and 'Lust for Power'. These domains correspond to common fantasy tropes (magic users, worshippers of evil gods, warriors, and 'professionals') and to the division of special skills in Advanced Fighting Fantasy.

For example, an evil priest is more likely to gather cultists than to start fights between criminal gangs.

### For each villain there is provided:

**Description:** A pen portrait of the mastermind or group the brave Hero must defeat. Their methods and motives vary, but all wish ill upon the world and pursue their goals regardless of the consequences for the common folk, be they human, elf or dwarf.

**Motivation:** A brief summary of their motivations and a table showing which type of missions they usually instigate.

**Lair:** The scene for the battle when you track them down, but usually has no wider impact on gameplay.

**Confrontation:** Each opponent will have their own tactics and abilities, which should be read carefully before fighting. It's likely you will need to track down your opponent multiple times before defeating them, as a villain's plans don't involve being defeated by an annoying hero!

**Item:** Each villain also has a unique magic item. Know what the item does before fighting the villain.

**Henchmen:** The most loyal servants of your opponent, always keen to do their bidding. Sometimes you might battle a henchman instead of the mastermind.

**Retaliation:** After your first mission (even if you don't strike your opponent), your opponent will realise a hero is trying to foil them, and there will be consequences! Retaliation continues until your opponent is defeated. Depending on the villain, this can be very inconvenient.

## Choosing a Villain

Whilst quests can exist without a specific villain, having an opponent makes the game more compelling. You can choose from the examples provided, create one of your own, or roll randomly (see section 9.2 for help).

### Table 9.1.1 Who is your Opponent?

Roll 1d6, Reroll 5, 6

| Roll 1d6 | 1 - Winds of Magic | 2 - Fury of the Gods | 3 - Chaos Unleashed | 4 - Lust for Power |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-2 | The winds of magic swirl and thunder around Titan; anyone who could seize their power would be mighty indeed.<br><br>**Villains:** The Magician, The Sorcerer, The Coven | The Gods look upon the mortal plane and grow restless, eager to play some part in the drama. Becoming their favourite will bring great rewards.<br><br>**Villains:** The Inquisitor, The Claws & Thorns, The Necromancer | The mighty battle drums sound out their rhythm and the dungeons of Titan spew out their foul denizens to unleash havoc.<br><br>**Villains:** The Horde, The Emerald Scale, The Nest Mother | What is life, if not a competition? And how else should we measure winners and losers, but by the accumulation of power?<br><br>**Villains:** The Syndicate, The Warlord, The House of Swords |
| 3-4 | | | | |

Each villain description will include a table of relevant adventures. These can be combined with campaign missions (section 10.1) to create a series of adventures culminating in the villain's defeat. You can roll for a new opponent after defeating one to continue your hero's story.

Use the villain descriptions and motivations to create custom quests and missions (see section 10.2 for advice). Remember that villains initially have their own plans and are not necessarily targeting the player characters. Missions should reflect this dynamic, and direct confrontation might only occur after the player characters have thwarted the villain multiple times, or if there's a specific reason for the villain to hate them.

## Creating Patrons and Allies

Whilst this section is focused on creating villains, it can also be used to help build patrons and allies that are friendly to the hero. All that is needed is to make the same rolls as before, but reinterpret some of the results. So if you roll "Gold - your opponent is looking to amass a great fortune" for a patron, it could mean your friend wants to ensure fair and honest trade. The role of patrons/allies is flexible and can be combined with Chapter 7 for ideas on motivations and trappings.
