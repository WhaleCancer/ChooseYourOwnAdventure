# Holdings and Dominions

Heroes in Advanced Fighting Fantasy might invest their spoils into legitimate enterprises like an inn, shop, mine, mercenary company, or temple. This chapter's content can be used for plot hooks, home bases, creating organizations, and providing hirelings, allies, and enemies, serving as a fun sub-system for experienced heroes.

## Holdings System

The system is a rough-and-ready one for approximating income from organizations or investments, designed for speed and playability rather than economic theory. These rules, along with hireling and mass-battle rules, allow heroes to play a larger part in their world.

Investments are graded on a scale of 1-12, with "gaps" in the scale. The table below provides details for each grade, regardless of the investment type.

## Holdings Table

| Grade | Buy | Upgrade | Maintenance | Rent | Income |
|-------|-----|---------|-------------|------|--------|
| 1 | 250gp | - | 10gp | 15gp | 2x |
| 2 | 500gp | 225gp | 20gp | 30gp | 4x |
| 4 | 1,000gp | 450gp | 40gp | 60gp | 8x |
| 6 | 2,000gp | 900gp | 80gp | 120gp | 16x |
| 8 | 4,000gp | 1,800gp | 160gp | 240gp | 32x |
| 10 | 8,000gp | 3,600gp | 320gp | 480gp | 64x |
| 12 | 16,000gp | 7,200gp | 640gp | 960gp | 128x |

### Buy

This is the direct purchase price for an investment at a specific grade. Low-graded investments are more common than high-graded ones.

### Upgrade

The cost and time to upgrade an investment one grade at a time. Examples: Grade 1 to Grade 2 costs 225gp and takes 1 month; Grade 6 to Grade 8 costs 1,800gp and takes 4 months.

### Maintenance

The required payment to keep an investment operational. Failure to pay results in no income for that month, and three consecutive missed payments reduce the investment's grade.

### Rent

The rental value of an investment as a safe option for a return, but it denies the owner personal use. A Grade 4 investment brings 60gp per month before maintenance, but the owner cannot use it. Suitable tenants are required, and higher-grade investments are harder to rent out.

### Income

A multiplier is used with a 2D6 roll each month to calculate gp income, with maintenance still deducted. If the owner runs the investment directly, their Hero's Stewardship special skill value (or an appropriate skill) is added to the 2D6 roll for income. Direct income also allows the Hero to make direct use of the investment.

**Modifiers:** Other modifiers can be added to monthly rolls. Examples include a +2 bonus for a medicinal herb shop during a plague, and a -3 penalty for a fleet holding near a pirate nest. Hero actions can also apply modifiers, such as a bonus for a mercenary company leader arranging a guard contract.

**Commercial Viability:** Investments must be commercially viable to generate direct income. An example describes fertile farmland making money, but if bordered by "The Forest of Howling Death" and "The Swamp of Despair," it would produce no food. The Director decides commercial viability. A holding usually covers the owner's (or steward's) living costs.

### Direct Use

Direct Use depends on the nature of the investment. Examples include using trading ships for travel, a Rogues Guild to prevent spies, or an Inn to house friends. A key rule: if an investment is used directly for more than two weeks in any given month, no income will be generated for that month.

### Grade

Grade is an analogue of SKILL, used to determine if a building, mine, or fleet survives disasters (earthquakes, gas explosions, storms) using a 2D6 check against the grade with modifiers. Failure is bad but not always disastrous. Grade is also used for opposed tests in direct competition between organizations, such as merchant guilds influencing a lord, using an opposed roll to determine success. If a holding is a building, it can function as a fortification in battles or skirmishes.

## Types of Investment

The range of investments a Hero can make is wide. Player ideas should align with existing organization types.

### Holding Types

| Grade | Building | Land | Mine | Trees | Temple |
|-------|----------|------|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Cottage | Plot | Stream Pan | Stand | Devotional |
| 2 | House | Small Field | Pit Mine | Copse | Way Shrine |
| 4 | Inn/Farm | Large Field | Cave Mine | Small Wood | Shrine |
| 6 | Hall | Huge Field | Shallow Mine | Large Wood | Chapel |
| 8 | Guild House | Hamlet | Normal Mine | Huge Wood | Small Temple |
| 10 | Small Castle | Village | Deep Mine | Small Forest | Large Temple |
| 12 | Large Castle | Estate | Huge Mine | Large Forest | Huge Temple |

| Grade | Organisation | Merchant | Tribe | Fleet | Workshop |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | >5 | Barrow | 10/5 | Small Boat | Craftsman |
| 2 | >10 | Stall | 20/10 | Large Boat | Small Workshop |
| 4 | >20 | Small Shop | 40/20 | Longship | Large Workshop |
| 6 | >40 | Shop | 80/40 | Small Galley | Small Craftshop |
| 8 | >80 | Local Trade | 160/80 | Large Galley | Large Craftshop |
| 10 | >160 | Mid-Trade | 320/160 | Small Fleet | Small Factory |
| 12 | >320 | Long-Trade | 640/320 | Large Fleet | Large Factory |

### Building

Building holdings are single buildings or ranges of buildings (e.g., private houses, inns, workshops). They are often used as a base rather than for profit. Examples: a cottage is a tiny two-room hut, a house is two-storey, an inn or farmhouse has several outbuildings, a hall is a grand house, and a guildhouse is a "veritable warren of rooms." Small and large castles are described as impressive fortifications with defensive value. All buildings usually have staff.

### Land

Land holdings are tracts of land worked for profit. A plot is a large garden, with fields of varying sizes. The largest sizes are associated with entire hamlets or villages. Land does not necessarily include tenants or village houses, but local villagers could be employed. Land can be used to grow crops or fruit, or keep livestock. Crops, animals, tools, and other necessary stock are included in the finances.

### Mine

A mine investment produces metal ore, coal, stone, precious metals, gemstones. Mines need defense. Miner numbers can be approximated using a staff table.

### Trees

Woodland investment for hunting, timber, or other uses. Increasing grades refer to larger areas. The number of foresters is determined by staff value if worked for profit.

### Temple

Temple ownership is reserved for senior Priests or Templars. Temples have profitability. Different types of shrines (devotional, way shrine) exist. Resident clergy numbers can be estimated using a staff table. A temple must be dedicated to a specific God when founded.

### Organisation

Holdings without land or structural elements, focusing on groups of people (trade guild, criminal gang, assassins brotherhood, mercenary company). Members are "active" and generally loyal to the organization and owner. Their numbers are listed on a table.

### Merchant

Merchant holdings range from mobile barrows to stalls and shops, emphasizing storage, accommodation, and weather protection. Trade routes for buying and transporting goods exist. Businesses can be single-product or multi-product.

### Tribe

Tribal holdings (inherited, granted, or conquered). A tribe is a clan of peoples (nomadic or sedentary) living outside normal civilization. The owner is the tribal chief responsible for survival. Numbers for male/female members, children, and combat capability are listed.

### Fleet

Holdings in boats and ships, including propulsion methods (sails, oars), types of vessels (longships, galleys). Sources of income include trade, fishing, exploration, piracy. Crew numbers can be approximated using a staff table.

### Workshop

Holdings that produce goods (pottery, furniture, clothing, weapons). Different scales exist, from a single craftsman working at home to workshops, craftshops, and factories with multiple master craftsmen, journeymen, and apprentices.

## Staff

Common staff members in holdings have basic stats (5 SKILL, 5 STAMINA, 2 in special skill). They are reluctant to fight or adventure, and their loyalty is tied to wages. Staff are usually background elements, but a table is provided to estimate staff numbers based on the grade of holding.

| Grade | Staff |
|-------|-------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 10 |
| 8 | 20 |
| 10 | 40 |
| 12 | 80 |

## Customisation

Holdings need to be customized, with the level of detail depending on the campaign style. A "brief description" end of the scale is suitable for high adventure games. A "fully detailed holding" end of the scale is suitable for games where heroes are more settled and use resources to achieve goals.

## Combined Holdings

Multiple holdings can be combined (e.g., a mountainside with a mine and wood, or a guild and guildhouse). A guildhouse functions as accommodation and meeting space, a status symbol. Its staff and maintenance are handled separately. Two money-making holdings should be maintained separately even if they are in the same place and owned by the same person.
