# Magic

Not all Characters are iron-thewed barbarians or chain-clad warriors. Some Characters are able to harness mystical power and use ancient and arcane arts to powerful and spectacular effect. Some Characters will know a few cantrips to make life just that little bit easier, whilst others will use much more powerful spells. Magic using Characters are often vulnerable in combat, but can also wield incredible power.

## Basic Concepts

There are a few concepts common to each of the magic types, and these are explained first, followed by rules for each specific type.

### MENTAL Characteristic

All Characters that desire to use Magic must have at least one point in the MENTAL Characteristic. This characteristic may affect the chance of successfully casting a spell, the amount of arcane power available and even the potency of some spells. A Character wanting to use a few cantrips or minor spells may only need a point or two in this characteristic, whilst a fully fledged Wizard will need a lot more!

### Magic Points

Spells of both the Minor Magic and Wizardry Magic types are powered by mystical energies that accumulate in each living being. This power is represented by the Magic Points score. A higher natural affinity with magic and magical training both increase the amount of power available to a spell caster.

If a Character has any points in the Magic-Minor or Magic-Wizardry skills, their Magic Point total should be calculated before play, and recalculated if necessary. The Magic Point score is calculated as follows:

`(MENTAL Characteristic + Magic-Wizardry skill) × 2`

That is, 2 Magic Points for every point in that characteristic and skill. These points are available every day to a Character, and are replenished by a night's sleep. If the Character has disturbed sleep or less than a full night, the Game Master may reduce the number of points gained. A Character may never restore their Magic Point total above the calculated value by sleep or potions. An increase in one of the contributory factors will however increase the magic Point maximum value.

### Spellcasting Roll

The rules for casting a spell are very similar to the main rule mechanic. That is roll two 6 sided dice and total the results. If that total is less than or equal to the Character's MENTAL characteristic plus the appropriate Magic skill, the spell is successfully cast. If the total is higher, the spell is not cast. If the result is a double 6, regardless of the target number, the spell has failed more spectacularly and a roll must be made on the Oops table (which says it all!).

There will probably be modifiers and even exceptions to this roll for each magical type and situation, but as usual the Game Master is the final arbiter.

Spells are usually cast in one combat round, but may also be prepared for longer. This preparation cannot be interrupted, and the casting round must follow the preparation immediately. It is fairly obvious to all observers that the spellcaster is preparing a spell.

### Oops… Spell Failure

Even the most proficient of spell casters can make mistakes in the intricate series of hand gestures and spoken phrases that constitute the spell. If the spellcaster rolls a double 6 on their spellcasting test, the spell has failed and must immediately roll on the Oops table below. This table will describe what actually happens when the caster completes the casting. The effects should be applied immediately as appropriate for the situation.

#### Oops Spell Failure Table

| 3D6 | Spell Failure Effect |
| --- | -------------------- |
| 3 | Caster is turned into a toad for 2D6 minutes. The toad retains the caster's intelligence but is in all other respects a normal toad. |
| 4 | Caster immediately ages by 2D6 years. This is permanent and irreversible. |
| 5 | There is a brief but heavy rain of fish in an area 50m across. All further physical actions in the area are at -2 due to the slipperiness underfoot. There is also sufficient fish for many good meals! |
| 6 | The Caster's speech is garbled for 1 hour, preventing verbal communication and spellcasting. |
| 7 | Caster has constant hiccups for 1D6 hours, and has a penalty of -4 to spell casting during that time. |
| 8 | The Caster grows a tail (the type is chosen by the Game Master). This remains for 1 week. |
| 9 | All Gold Pieces carried by the caster turn into butterflies and flap around randomly in the area. |
| 10 | An Orc (7 SKILL / 8 STAMINA) materialises beside caster, and is very angry….. |
| 11 | The Caster's hair turns bright blue. This will only change as the hair grows out. |
| 12 | The Caster's shoes catch fire. See Combat rules for fire rules. These shoes are now ruined. |
| 13 | The Caster grows a pair of curly goats horns. These remain for 1 day. |
| 14 | A dead giant squid appears above the head of a random party member. The falling squid causes 1D3 points of STAMINA damage and knocks the Character down. |
| 15 | The Caster's hair grows rapidly for 1 hour, ending up floor length. |
| 16 | The weapons of everyone within sight of the caster turn into bunches of flowers. The sparks radiating from the caster make it blatantly obvious that the caster is the source of this change. Magical weapons return to normal after 10 minutes, but all other changes are irreversible. |
| 17 | The Caster immediately changes sex. Only a powerful Archmage can reverse this. |
| 18 | The Caster vanishes…. (At the Game Master's discretion, the Caster may reappear, unconscious, some short time later within a mile or so of the casting point, smoking gently!) |

### Resisting Magic

Some magical spells and powers can be resisted by their target, even if they are cast successfully. Any spells that can be resisted are stated as such in each description. The same goes for most magical items and creature powers.

If it is not clearly stated whether a spell or power can be resisted, it falls to the Game Master to decide.

If a Character is targeted with a spell that can be resisted, and the spell is cast successfully, the Character must immediately Test their LUCK. A successful test means that the spell fails to have its full effect (although some spells may well do something, even if the Character is lucky) and a failed test means that the spell has its full effect. As with other uses of LUCK, the Character's current LUCK score is reduced by 1 point regardless of the result. A Character may also, voluntarily choose not to Test their LUCK, which will cause them to take the full effect of the spell, but will also not reduce their current LUCK score.

If a monster or NPC without a LUCK characteristic is targeted by such a spell, they instead test their SKILL. The fact that the SKILL of the monster is not reduced after each test should not cause too many problems in most cases.

It is also possible for a spellcaster to reduce the chance of a target making their magic save. If the caster invests extra magic points (wizard) or STAMINA (sorcerer) into the spell purely for the purposes of reducing a target's resistance, the test for LUCK must be modified by this amount. Thus a Wizard wishes to cast Fear onto an enemy warrior. Wanting to make extra sure the warrior fails his test for LUCK, the Wizard spends an extra 4 magic points. The warrior has a LUCK of 9, but to resist this spell must roll a 5 or less (LUCK 9 minus 4 modifier). These extra points must be invested before the spell casting test is made.

## Magic Types

EPIC supports three main types of magic:

- **[[RULES/Magic/Minor-Magic|Minor Magic]]** - Easy-to-cast cantrips that require little magical power
- **[[RULES/Magic/Wizardry|Wizardry]]** - Traditional spellcasting powered by magic points
- **[[RULES/Magic/Sorcery|Sorcery]]** - Spells powered by the caster's own STAMINA

Each type has its own rules, advantages, and limitations, detailed in their respective articles.
