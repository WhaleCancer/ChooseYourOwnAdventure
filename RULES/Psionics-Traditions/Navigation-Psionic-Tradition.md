# Navigation Psionic Tradition (Astronavigator)

The Navigation Tradition focuses on piloting craft, manipulating sensors, and protecting vehicles.

## False Signals

This ability requires absolute concentration from the psionicist for a full round. When used, the ability will allow the psionicist to mislead the sensors of other craft. The psionicist makes an opposed test against the Sensor Skill of the other craft, and if successful, the psionicist can decide what information is detected. External modules such as weapons and thrusters cannot be masked, nor can the type and appearance of the vessel be altered. Each use of this ability costs 1 PSI point.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point

## Mental Pilot

This ability allows a psionicist to link their mind to that of a flying saucer (or a human craft that uses the same technology). The psionicist has reduced awareness of what is happening around their own body (-2 to Awareness tests) but can control the linked craft as if it were their own body. The ranks in this ability can be used as the Pilot Skill, and in many cases the Director will apply a special bonus of +1 or even +2 to allow for the instinctive control this ability allows (determined per craft). The link takes a full round to establish or break, and once active, costs 1 PSI point per day to maintain (even if the link is broken and restored several times during the day).

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per day to maintain

## Overcharge

With this ability, a psionicist can convert PSI points into bonuses to ship systems and tests. After making a successful test, the psionicist can add +1 to one ship system for each PSI point spent (up to their rank in this ability):

- Ship Combat rating
- Ship Speed rating
- +1 to Sensors test
- +1 to other module test
- +1 to a specific Damage roll
- +1 to a specific Armor roll

The psionicist can choose which systems to boost, although no system can have more than a +1 bonus from this ability in any one round.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per +1 bonus

## Shield Craft

This ability allows a psionicist to reduce the damage a flying saucer (or human craft with appropriate technology) takes from weapons and even collisions. This takes a full round to use, and requires an ability test. If successful, the psionicist can sacrifice 1 PSI point to negate each point of damage (up to their rank in this ability).

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per point of damage negated
