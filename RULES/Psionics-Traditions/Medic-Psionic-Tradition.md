# Medic Psionic Tradition (Mental Healer)

The Medic Tradition focuses on healing, empathy, and protective abilities.

## Empathy

This ability allows the psionicist to accurately diagnose the condition of a patient. This takes a full round, requires a successful roll and costs 1 PSI point. The type of conditions diagnosed vary with the number of points in the power. With a single use, a psionicist will diagnose any and all ailments and injuries that can be detected. Use of this ability will grant a bonus of +2 to mundane or technological attempts to heal the injury or wound, but can also diagnose mystery ailments that confound science.

- **Rank 1:** External injuries can be accurately assessed.
- **Rank 2:** Internal injuries can be determined and identified.
- **Rank 3:** Diseases common to the species of the patient can be identified.
- **Rank 4:** Any active poisons or residual damage can be identified.
- **Rank 5:** Mental afflictions in the patient can be diagnosed.
- **Rank 6:** Almost any affliction, including xeno pathogens, can be identified.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point

## Energy Medicine

This ability restores general health and energy to the psionicist or a patient. The ability costs 1 PSI point per use and takes a full round and a successful test to use. The psionicist must touch the patient. When used, this ability will instantly heal a number of STAMINA points equal to the rank of this ability.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point

## Mental Healing

With this ability, the psionicist can remove mental afflictions suffered by the patient, whether natural or induced via psionics, drugs or technology. The psionicist must lay their hands on the head of the patient, make a successful test and spend 1 PSI point. The use of this ability takes a full round for each rank required. The affliction will then be removed totally and permanently.

- **Rank 1:** Will remove extreme fear or other powerful emotion.
- **Rank 2:** Will remove phobias and similar minor compulsions.
- **Rank 3:** Will cure more serious afflictions that do not manifest all of the time.
- **Rank 4:** Will cure more serious afflictions that are manifested all of the time.
- **Rank 5:** Will remove mania and major afflictions.
- **Rank 6:** Will cure catatonia and complete mental collapse.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point

## Psychic Surgery

This ability allows rapid and immediate healing of wounds, injuries, and diseases—even those considered lethal or incurable by human medicine. Healing via Psychic Surgery is instantaneous but requires a full round to use and a successful Test (such as SKILL, PSI, or a relevant ability as decided by the GM). Use of Psychic Surgery consumes PSI points.

- **Rank 1:** Heal minor injuries (up to 1 SKILL point lost or equivalent small wounds).
- **Rank 2:** Heal moderate injuries (up to 2 SKILL points lost, broken bones, deep cuts, mild infections).
- **Rank 3:** Heal major injuries (3+ SKILL loss, critical injuries, internal damage, severe trauma, or common diseases like flu).
- **Rank 4:** Cure serious chronic illnesses (diabetes, heart disease), multiple major injuries, and severe infections.
- **Rank 5:** Cure life-threatening conditions (aggressive cancers, organ failure, advanced poisons, or rapidly fatal diseases) and fully restore lost SKILL.
- **Rank 6:** Cure or regenerate almost anything short of death—terminal illnesses, total body trauma, rare alien diseases, or reverse crippling disabilities (at the GM's discretion, may even revive a subject moments after death if the body is sufficiently intact).

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per rank used
