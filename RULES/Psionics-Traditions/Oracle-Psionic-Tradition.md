# Oracle Psionic Tradition (Academic Psionicist)

The Oracle Tradition focuses on perception, precognition, and remote sensing.

## Aura Reading

Activating this ability uses a full round, requires a test and costs 1 PSI point. The psionicist can read the psychic aura that surrounds all sentient beings. The target of this ability will not be aware that they are being examined. The amount of information acquired will depend on the rank of the ability, with all lesser rank information also being read.

- **Rank 1:** Current major emotion (fear, anger etc).
- **Rank 2:** Rough idea of the current intentions of the target.
- **Rank 3:** More accurate idea of the target's intentions.
- **Rank 4:** General description (two words) of the personality of the target.
- **Rank 5:** Comprehensive overview of the character of the target.
- **Rank 6:** Read the main surface thoughts that round.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point

## Precognition

This ability allows the psionicist to get a "gut feeling" about future events both near and distant. In practice, the psionicist activates this power, taking a whole round, and makes a test to see if the power succeeds. The psionicist can then spend a number of PSI points up to the rank they have in this ability and can ask the Director a question about the future. This question could be phrased as "what would happen if...", could be "will X happen?" or could be some other question. Within the constraints of the number of PSI points used (see below), the Director should then provide some information. However, it should be noted that the future is not accurately predictable even with psionic powers and so the visions/feelings may not come true if steps are taken to change events.

- **1 point:** General gut feeling about an event in the next few rounds.
- **2 points:** Feeling about an event up to a day in the future.
- **3 points:** Strong feeling about an event up to a week away.
- **4 points:** Very brief glimpse of the future up to a month in the future.
- **5 points:** Vague or cryptic vision up to six months away.
- **6 points:** Fairly specific vision up to a year in the future of a likely outcome.

**Cost:** 1-6 PSI points (as described above)

## Scrying

When activated, this ability allows a psionicist to see and hear (or even smell) at a distance, even through walls or in the dark. The power takes a full round to activate and requires a successful test. Once activated, the psionicist must close their eyes and concentrate for a full round to sense as if they were in the remote location. The power costs 1 PSI for every minute (or part thereof) and will remain active as long as PSI points are spent, even if there is no active scrying. The psionicist can either specify a distance and direction (15 feet straight ahead) or a location known to the psionicist (the starship bridge) each round and as long as the location is within range, the psionicist will sense as if they were there (with basic dark vision). This ability can be blocked by certain technologies.

- **Rank 1:** Scry up to 10 feet.
- **Rank 2:** Scry up to a mile away.
- **Rank 3:** Range of 10 miles.
- **Rank 4:** Scrying works up to 100 miles.
- **Rank 5:** Range of 1000 miles.
- **Rank 6:** Scry anywhere on the same planet or its orbit.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per minute

## Sense Person

This ability allows the Dark Psionicist to detect a specific known person within 1 mile of their location. This power activates automatically when the enemy is within 1 mile, costing the psionicist 1 PSI point. This activation does not require a roll, nor does it require an action. Although it tells the psionicist that the enemy is within range, it does not give exact direction or distance. A Dark Psionicist may have as many enemies linked to this power at any one time as they have ranks in this ability. It takes a full hour of meditation to add or replace an enemy.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per automatic activation
