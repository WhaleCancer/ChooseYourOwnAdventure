# Harvest Psionic Tradition (Dark Psionics)

The Harvest Tradition focuses on mental manipulation, fear, and control—powers often associated with hostile entities and cultists.

## Dominate

Using this ability, the Dark Psionicist can force a target within sight to act against their will, in a way demanded by the Dark Psionicist. The ability requires a full round to activate, and then the Dark Psionicist and target must both make opposed PSIONICS + Ability tests, although a non-psionicist can make a SKILL test instead. If the target loses, they will be under the control of the Dark Psionicist for a number of rounds equal to the ability score. The Dark Psionicist does not need to issue a verbal command each round, but for each command, they must spend a PSI point. If the target moves out of sight, the domination ends.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per command

## Induce Fear

This ability will induce extreme fear and terror of the Dark Psionicist into one target in sight. This ability has an activation time of one round and costs 1 PSI point. Upon activation, the Dark Psionicist and target make an opposed test. If the Dark Psionicist wins, the target becomes afraid of the psionicist and will need to make a SKILL test to avoid running away any time they see the psionicist. Even if they do stay and fight, the target will suffer a penalty of -2 to all actions. The Psionicist may renew the effect each new day at a cost of 1 PSI point per target, and may have a maximum number of active Fear effects equal to the rank of the ability.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point per target

## Mental Affliction

With this ability, the Dark Psionicist can inflict a temporary or permanent mental affliction on one target. This ability takes a full round to use, and requires an opposed roll with the target. If successful, the Dark Psionicist can use one or more PSI points (up to their rank in this ability) to impose the desired affliction. If the affliction is permanent, it can be cured with medication, technology or another appropriate psychic ability.

- **1 PSI point:** Inflicts temporary fear, lasting 2D6 rounds. The target must pass a SKILL test every round to take any action other than run or hide. At the discretion of the Director, a Dark Psionicist may inflict a different powerful emotion.
- **2 PSI points:** Inflicts a permanent phobia of the psionicist's choice. The target must pass a SKILL test to overcome this phobia every time they encounter whatever it is they fear.
- **3 PSI points:** Inflicts a more serious mental affliction that will come and go, seemingly at random. Some days the target will suffer badly, and others they will not. The Director should determine the details.
- **4 PSI points:** Inflicts a serious mental affliction (similar to 3 PSI points) that manifests all or most of the time.
- **5 PSI points:** Inflicts a very severe affliction which manifests all of the time.
- **6 PSI points:** Inflicts a crippling affliction such as catatonia or mental collapse, effectively preventing the target from acting at all until cured.

**Cost:** 1-6 PSI points (as described above)

## Restrain

This ability will bind the target object or creature in bands of magical energy, fixing them in place even if they are airborne! Once bound, the target cannot move a muscle, although they can still breathe. Even gravity will not affect a Restrained target, so a falling boulder or leaping combatant could both be fixed in the air. The ability lasts for three minutes, and normal physics will take over when the Restraint is removed. Up to 3 cubic metres may be affected by this ability.

**Cost:** 1 PSI point
