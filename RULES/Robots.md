## Robots

If cyberware is the **inside‑out** face of the Ascension Programme, then robots are its **outside‑in** face—mechanical bodies wrapped around alien logic and human ambition. In EPIC’s world history, Japan took the global lead in robotics after the 1970s, pushing far beyond real‑world projects like **WABOT‑1** thanks to quiet access to recovered alien components and equations. By 1985, Japanese conglomerates and research institutes export humanoid robots, industrial manipulators, and “smart dolls” to the rest of the world, while keeping their most advanced work very close to home.

In British Columbia, Japanese‑built machines show up on factory floors, in hospitals, and in glossy news features about “our brave robot future.” The public thinks in terms of advanced WABOT‑style units—awkward but impressive helpers. Only a handful of people know that some of those chassis are testbeds for the same Ascension tech that turns soldiers into cyborgs.

For game purposes, “robots” include any **non‑biological, machine‑minded entities**: service bots, industrial manipulators, hunter‑killer drones, and fully autonomous androids. Most bear Japanese model numbers somewhere inside their chassis, whether they were shipped directly from Osaka and Tokyo, licensed to North American partners, or quietly diverted to Ascension black sites.

## Robot Types

EPIC uses five broad robot types inspired by the reference rules. These describe **how smart** a machine is and what sort of roles it fills. In public, Japan officially exports Types I–III and a few carefully supervised Type IVs; Type V units and certain weaponised Type IV designs exist only in classified files and in the nightmares of people who have seen them in action.

- **Type I – Task Machines**  
  - Single‑purpose machines (floor scrubbers, welding arms, bomb‑disposal rigs).  
  - No real intelligence; they cannot improvise outside their programming.  
  - In play, treat them as obstacles or tools rather than characters.

- **Type II – Specialist Bots**  
  - Robots with limited adaptability in a narrow field (mechanics, farm bots, animal handlers, industrial drones).  
  - Can use one or two Special Skills at modest rank related to their job.  
  - Common in larger industrial sites and some hospitals.

- **Type III – General Service Robots**  
  - Multi‑purpose assistants: home help units, hotel staff bots, delivery and maintenance drones.  
  - Have basic pseudo‑intelligence; can converse, follow complex instructions, and handle people.  
  - Sometimes encountered as NPCs with simple personalities.

- **Type IV – Advanced Specialist / Semi‑AI**  
  - High‑end medical robots, security units, legal/translation machines, advanced pilots.  
  - Very sophisticated programming but still focused on specific roles.  
  - Often tight‑leashed by corporations, governments, or the Ascension Programme.

- **Type V – True AI / Artificial Humans**  
  - Fully self‑directed artificial minds capable of learning, adapting, and developing quirks.  
  - Rare, heavily regulated, and of intense interest to both aliens and technocrats.  
  - Only Type V robots are suitable as **player characters**, and even then at the Director’s discretion.

Low‑tech human industry mostly produces Types I–III, with a few Type IV machines in flagship hospitals and corporate facilities. Type V units show up almost exclusively in **alien deployments, Ascension black projects, or one‑off experimental prototypes**.

## Robot Characters (Type V)

Type V robots with true AI can be run as Characters or major NPCs. They are built differently to human characters:

- Replace **LUCK** with **TECH**.  
  - Robots do not benefit from luck or divine favour; tests that call for LUCK automatically fail for them.  
  - **TECH** represents the sophistication and quality of their components and AI core.  
- Robots also have **SKILL** and **STAMINA** like any other character.

### Starting Stats (suggested)

- **SKILL 6**, **STAMINA 10**, **TECH 4** for a fresh Type V unit.  
- The player gets **8 points** to improve these three:
  - SKILL up to max 9.  
  - STAMINA up to max 18 (each point of STAMINA costs 2 of the 8).  
  - TECH up to max 10.

Robots do **not** have PSIONICS and cannot use psionic abilities. They are also normally immune to direct psionic effects that target the mind or emotions, but powers that manipulate **machines, electricity, or energy** may still affect them (see `Psionics`).

If a robot’s TECH is ever reduced below the **required level for its modules or skill cards**, those functions shut down until repaired.

---

## Embedded Skills and Modules

Instead of learning every Special Skill the slow human way, robots come with **embedded skills** and **modules**:

- At creation, pick **two embedded Special Skills** at **rank 2** that define the core role of the robot (e.g. `Computers`, `Engineering`, `Melee Weapons`, `Firearms`, `Medicine`).  
- These can be improved with XP like any other Special Skill.  
- Additional skills can be installed later as **Skill Cards** or firmware updates at in‑game cost (money, time in a workshop, and suitable TECH rating).

Robots can also be fitted with **Talents / Modules** that echo the reference system. The Director can treat these as special advantages that require a **minimum TECH** rating:

- **Wheels / Tracks** (TECH 4): replace legs; much faster on flat ground but clumsy on stairs or rough terrain.  
- **Integral Tool or Weapon** (TECH 5): one built‑in tool or small weapon (still needs ammo or refuelling).  
- **Armoured Shell – Light / Medium / Heavy** (TECH 4/6/7): counts as Light/Medium/Heavy natural armour.  
- **Languages Module** (TECH 6): near‑perfect translation in many languages.  
- **Detachable Probes / Drones** (TECH 6): small remote units for scouting or minor tasks.  
- **Self‑Repair Module** (TECH 9): slow self‑healing using stored parts and energy.  
- **Stealth Mode** (TECH 10): design and counter‑sensors give bonuses to Stealth tests against living observers and some tech.  
- **Android Shell** (TECH 10): appears human on casual inspection; only detailed medical tests or damage reveal the truth.  
- **Emotional Emulation Suite** (TECH 8): sophisticated affect simulation for more convincing social interaction.  
- **Obedience Shackles** (TECH 7): hard‑coded behavioural restraints and remote override channels.  
- **Environmental Package** (TECH 6): extra seals and systems for deep cold, underwater, or near‑vacuum work.  
- **Psionic Interface Node** (TECH 9): hardware bridge between robot systems and human psionics or alien minds.

The Director can add more modules as needed, especially for **alien and Ascension‑built machines**.

## Robot Module Reference

The following entries expand each of the standard modules. Treat them like Talents or cyberware options for robots; each requires a **minimum TECH rating** and usually some in‑world downtime in a workshop or lab.

### Wheels / Tracks

- **Requirement**: TECH 4  
- **Effect**: Replaces legs with wheels or treads.  
  - Gain a **significant movement boost** on flat or gently sloped terrain (usually +1 range band to sprint or chase actions).  
  - Gain advantage on checks to **resist being knocked down or pushed back**.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Treat stairs, ladders, and very rough ground as **difficult terrain or impassable** without assistance.  
  - Stealth tests may suffer a **‑1 penalty** on hard surfaces due to noise or vibration.

### Integral Tool or Weapon

- **Requirement**: TECH 5  
- **Effect**: The robot has one **built‑in tool or small weapon** (e.g., cutting torch, pistol, taser, welding arm).  
  - The item can be deployed or retracted as a **fast action**, making it harder to disarm the robot.  
  - When retracted, it requires a deliberate search or scan to detect.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - The weapon or tool still uses **ammo, fuel, or maintenance** as normal.  
  - Certain jurisdictions treat integral weapons as **illegal military hardware**, drawing extra legal and media heat.

### Armoured Shell – Light / Medium / Heavy

- **Requirements**: TECH 4 (Light), 6 (Medium), 7 (Heavy)  
- **Effect**: Adds permanent armour plating to the chassis.  
  - Counts as **Light, Medium, or Heavy natural armour** respectively (see `Armour`).  
  - If the robot also wears external armour, the Director may grant **+1 column** on the protection track for especially over‑built designs.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Increases **Encumbrance** (Light often counts as Normal; Medium/Heavy may count as Large for movement and transport).  
  - Heavy shells are visually obvious unless disguised, making the robot stand out in civilian or undercover situations.

### Languages Module

- **Requirement**: TECH 6  
- **Effect**: Integrated translation suite tied directly into the AI core.  
  - Grants broad competence in **spoken and written languages**, including many dialects after brief exposure.  
  - Provides a bonus to **social and negotiation tests** when language would otherwise be a barrier.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Extremely rare languages or alien communication may still require **special data, a live tutor, or research**.  
  - Logs of translated conversations can become **evidence or blackmail material** if retrieved or subpoenaed.

### Detachable Probes / Drones

- **Requirement**: TECH 6  
- **Effect**: Three small, independent drones or probes stored in the robot’s chassis.  
  - Each drone can fly, roll, or swim (choose at installation), has low STAMINA, and can carry a **sensor package** or tiny tool/weapon.  
  - Only one probe can be **actively piloted at a time**, usually drawing on the robot’s own Awareness or relevant skills.  
  - Probes extend the robot’s **line of sight and sensor reach**, ideal for scouting, bomb disposal, or infiltration.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Drones are **fragile** and expensive to replace. Losing them may reduce TECH temporarily or require dedicated repair scenes.  
  - Signals can be **jammed, intercepted, or hacked**, giving enemies a way to spy back or turn the probes against their owner.

### Self‑Repair Module

- **Requirement**: TECH 9  
- **Effect**: Internal repair system with a limited number of “charges.”  
  - Once per scene, the robot may attempt a **TECH‑based Self‑Repair test** to restore **2 STAMINA** (or more on a critical success), consuming one charge.  
  - Independently of active use, the robot can recover a small amount of STAMINA each day while consuming charges, even without an engineer.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - When all charges are exhausted, the module is inert until replenished in a **proper workshop** with parts.  
  - A critical failure on a repair roll may cause **temporary malfunctions** (limb glitches, sensor noise, movement penalties) until serviced.

### Stealth Mode

- **Requirement**: TECH 10  
- **Effect**: Special joints, sound‑dampening surfaces, and counter‑sensor measures.  
  - Grants a **+2 bonus to Stealth tests** against living observers.  
  - Against basic technological sensors (motion detectors, simple cameras, low‑grade radar) treat the robot as having **+3 to resist detection**.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - The system is delicate; heavy damage may temporarily **disable Stealth Mode** until repairs are made.  
  - High‑end military or alien sensors may be designed specifically to **see through** this kind of masking, at the Director’s discretion.

### Android Shell

- **Requirement**: TECH 10  
- **Effect**: A full body shell designed to **pass as human (or another chosen species)** at first and even second glance.  
  - Casual observers and basic medical checks will not notice anything unusual.  
  - Opposed, in‑depth examination (Medicine vs TECH, advanced scanners, or significant damage) can reveal the truth.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Synthetic skin, hair, and soft‑tissue components require **maintenance and replacement**; neglect leads to an uncanny or “wax museum” look.  
  - Discovery of an android in a human role can trigger severe **social, legal, or religious fallout**, especially in conservative communities or in areas sensitive to Ascension influence.


## Robots in Combat and Damage

Robots are played much like any other character in combat, with the following tweaks:

- **No LUCK**: they cannot spend or test LUCK, and any LUCK‑based avoidance automatically fails unless a Talent or psionic power explicitly overrides this.  
- **Critical hits**: limb loss, bleeding, and some organ effects do not apply. Instead, the Director may rule that critical hits damage specific systems (arms, sensors, locomotion, AI core).  
- A robot reduced to **0 STAMINA** shuts down rather than dies; reaching **–4 STAMINA** destroys critical systems and may permanently reduce TECH by 1.  
- Repair is done via **Engineering** and parts, not Medicine.  
- Fire and high‑energy weapons can be especially dangerous if the robot lacks appropriate armour or resistances (see `Armour`).

Robots cannot normally be healed by psionic powers that work on living tissue, but some Mental Healer or Astronavigator abilities might interact with their AI in unusual ways at the Director’s discretion.

## Factions and Robot Use

Robots in EPIC fall broadly into three groups, all of them touched—openly or secretly—by Japanese robotics culture:

- **Human Civilian Tech**  
  - Mostly Types I–II made under licence from Japanese firms, with a few Type III and carefully supervised Type IV medical and service robots in big cities. Think advanced WABOT‑style walkers, translator dolls, and industrial arms with friendly faces.  
  - Found in factories, hospitals, shipping yards, high‑end restaurants, and research labs.  
  - Occasionally hacked or repurposed by criminals and local governments, often without understanding just how deeply alien some of the firmware really is.

- **Ascension Programme Constructs**  
  - High‑end Type IV and V units built in joint projects between Japanese megacorps, defence ministries, and the shadowy Ascension leadership. Many never leave secret facilities in Japan, but prototypes and “export models” appear in North American black sites.  
  - Includes **enforcement drones, cybernetic shepherd units, humanoid pilots, and eerie child‑like androids** that feel one step away from an Evangelion plug‑in. These designs deliberately blur the line between robot, cyborg, and psionic interface.  
  - Often integrated with the same **Ascension Uplink / Hive Relay** infrastructure that cyberware uses, making them walking terminals of the control grid.

- **Alien Machines**  
  - Sometimes follow the same Type I–V logic, but often feel wrong: modular swarm drones, liquid‑metal repair units, or organic‑looking “piloted” shells for alien minds.  
  - Human engineers reverse‑engineer these into new Japanese and Ascension designs; use the robot rules as a base, but the Director may give them unique psionic or biological interactions.

---

## Robot Player Characters

Allowing a Type V robot as a Character can make for strong contrast with cybernetic and psionic humans:

- They experience the **Ascension conflict** from the opposite side—built to be what the technocrats and some aliens want humanity to become.  
- They are immune to some horrors (possession, certain psionic attacks) but vulnerable to others (remote overrides, Kill‑Switches, reformatting).  
- Their very existence raises questions about **soul, personhood, and ownership**, mirroring the dilemmas around heavy cyberware and psionic Dark Temptation.

If you permit robot PCs, make sure they are tied to the factions and mysteries of the setting: an escaped Ascension prototype, a recovered alien drone that achieved self‑awareness, or a municipal service android that “woke up” after a psionic event.
