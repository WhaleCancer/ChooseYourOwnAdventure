## Overview

On the pages that follow you will find details of some of the fearsome monsters, humanoids and animals that can be encountered in the savage lands of Allansia and beyond. You can use them in designing your own adventures as a solo player, or players of Fighting Fantasy - The Introductory Role-playing Game may find themselves coming up against them in new adventures designed by their Director. Let us hope your swords remain sharp and your STAMINA is good...

In each of the entries that follow there are two sections: one lists the statistics for the creature for ease of reference, while the other consists of a longer description of the creature and its special features. The list for each creature provides the following details:

## 1. SKILL and STAMINA

These are average values, as not all creatures of the same species are exactly alike. In a large group of the creatures there will be some variation in these scores. For example, in a band of four Goblins, two may be typical creatures with SKILL 5, STAMINA 5; one might be the leader of the group, with SKILL 6, STAMINA 6; the last might be a little weaker, with only SKILL 4, STAMINA 3. Scores should only be varied by one or two points.

## 2. NUMBER OF ATTACKS

Solo players may ignore this score, as it is only used in a multi-player game. In most cases there are no details of the number of Attacks, which means that the creature has only a single Attack. Otherwise, the number given indicates the maximum number of opponents that a creature can fight in one Attack Round. If the creature has more Attacks than there are adventurers, it does not get any extra Attacks. Each Attack will be conducted from the single Attack Strength rolled for the creature, unless it says otherwise in the creature's description.

## 3. HABITAT

This indicates the general area a creature may be encountered in. Where more than one type of habitat is listed, the first is where the creature is most often found, the second where it is less frequently found, and so on. For example, Giant Eagles live mostly in mountainous areas, but they may also sometimes be encountered in hilly or wilderness areas.

### Habitat Terminology

The terms should be self-explanatory, but the following may help a Director when placing monsters in his adventures:

- **Towns** includes villages and other settlements.
- **Ruins** are found above ground, and can include towers, castles, houses and so on.
- **Dungeons**, on the other hand, are found below ground, and will not include natural caves.
- **Plains** are wide, generally grassy areas such as the Pagan Plain.
- **Wilderness** means large dead areas which are rocky and desolate, such as the Windward Plain or the fringes of the Desert of Skulls.
- **Demonic or Magical Plane** refers to a supernatural home in another dimension; there are further explanations of these in the individual descriptions of the creatures.

## 4. NUMBER ENCOUNTERED

These numbers show how many creatures between one and three adventurers will encounter. If there are more players, their Director should feel free to double or treble the number they meet. Some beings are solitary creatures, however, and will only be encountered on their own: the description of the particular creature will have further information in these cases.

### Rolling the Numbers

Rolling the numbers is simple:

- **1-6** means roll one die, and that many creatures are encountered
- **2-12** means roll two dice
- **3-18** means roll three dice, and so on
- **1-3** means roll one die and halve the result, rounding any fractions up
- **1-2** means roll one die: if the result is an odd number the score is 1, if it is even the score is 2

There are also a few other special numbers, which are explained in the descriptions of the monsters concerned.

## 5. TYPE

This gives a rough indication of the nature of the monster, and is also used to generate Treasure for it (see page 125).

## 6. REACTION

When adventurers first encounter a creature it will react to them in one of a number of ways:

- **Friendly:** It greets them warmly and shows no hostility. It may share food or provide useful information for the adventurer(s).
- **Neutral:** It is wary of them, but does not show open hostility; it will probably react if attacked, but may be fairly friendly if treated carefully.
- **Unfriendly:** It shows obvious displeasure at encountering them, but does not leap into battle immediately; it may wait to sum up the situation before deciding one way or the other.
- **Hostile:** This often means it is hungry! The creature will attack immediately.

You will notice that for a few creatures two or more of these reactions are listed together. In these cases the creature may react either way, depending perhaps on what the adventurers are doing.

## 7. INTELLIGENCE

This final detail shows how clever a creature is. There are four scores for this: High, Average, Low and None.

- **Humanoids** will generally be rated as High (humans come somewhere in the middle of this category).
- Most **monsters** and some **animals** will be Average
- The rest are **Low**
- In general only **plants** have no intelligence at all

Intelligence should be borne in mind when considering the reaction of a particular creature. Clever beings will obviously use more cunning in their attack, and may even have spells or special weapons which they can use. Stupider creatures are more likely just to leap into battle regardless!
