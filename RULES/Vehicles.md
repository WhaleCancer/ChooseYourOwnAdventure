## Vehicles

British Columbia in 1985 runs on **trucks, ferries, logging roads, and back‑alley alleys**. Vehicles matter for chases, ambushes, smuggling, and how factions actually move people and cargo around.

EPIC keeps vehicle rules **light and abstract**, aligned with the existing weapon/encumbrance system:

- Each vehicle type has **Passengers**, **Cargo** (rough encumbrance capacity), **Armour**, and **STAMINA**.  
- By default, **person‑scale weapons deal half STAMINA damage** to vehicles (round down), unless they are explicitly anti‑armor (see `RULES/Weapons/Anti-Armor`).  
- Critical hits and spectacular crashes are primarily **narrative tools**—use them when a vehicle loses most of its STAMINA or takes a very high damage result.

### Generic Road Vehicles

Use these profiles for most cars, trucks, and bikes. Faction‑specific examples appear later.

| Type              | Examples                               | Passengers* | Cargo**       | Armour | STAMINA | Off‑Road | Notes |

| Box Truck         | Small straight truck                   | 2          | 10+ Normal    | 0–1    | 16      | Poor     | Moving companies, warehouse deliveries                        |
| Semi + Trailer    | Highway tractor with container trailer | 2          | 20+ Normal    | 0–1    | 20+     | Poor     | Long‑haul freight; hitting one is bad news for everyone       |

### Boats and Watercraft

The B.C. coast is full of small boats, trawlers, and ferries. Use these for most maritime scenes.

| Type           | Examples                        | Crew/Passengers | Cargo        | Armour | STAMINA | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Small Boat     | Skiffs, tin boats, small runabouts | 1–4          | 2 Normal    | 0      | 8       | Short‑range; vulnerable to weather and gunfire                |
| Speedboat      | Fiberglass speedboats           | 2–6             | 3 Normal    | 0      | 10      | Fast; good for smuggling and quick getaways                  |
| Fishing Boat   | Small trawlers, seiners         | 3–8             | 8+ Normal   | 0–1    | 16      | Excellent cover as legit workboats; common cartel/BCB asset  |
| Tug / Workboat | Harbour tugs, utility craft     | 2–6             | 10+ Normal  | 1      | 18      | Powerful, slow; used to quietly move larger hulls or barges  |
| Barge          | Unpowered cargo barge           | 0–a few         | 30+ Normal  | 0–1    | 20+     | Requires tug; ideal for bulk smuggling and “lost” containers |

Large ferries and ships can be treated as **set‑pieces**: treat them as having very high STAMINA and localized systems (bridge, engines, cargo holds) rather than tracking every hit.

### Aircraft

Aircraft are dangerous, rare tools—APEX, military, and high‑end smugglers use them more than street gangs.

| Type              | Examples                    | Crew/Passengers | Cargo      | Armour | STAMINA | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Bush Plane        | Cessna‑type STOL aircraft   | 1–4             | 3 Normal  | 0      | 10      | Remote airstrips, lakes; ideal for fly‑in smuggling          |
| Light Helicopter  | Bell 206, Hughes 500        | 1–5             | 3 Normal  | 0–1    | 12      | Observation, insertion, news choppers, APEX/RCMP assets      |
| Utility Helicopter| UH‑1‑class                  | 2–12            | 8 Normal  | 1      | 16      | Military / high‑end corporate or APEX transport               |

Aircraft can be **forced to land** or **crippled** by high‑column hits, anti‑armor weapons, or deliberate targeting of engines/rotors. Crashes should be treated as severe threats to anyone on board.

## Using Vehicles in Combat & Chases

- **Half Damage Rule:** By default, person‑scale weapons deal **half STAMINA damage** to vehicles (round down). Dedicated anti‑armor weapons (RPGs, missiles, heavy plasma) deal **full damage**.  
- **Criticals:** When a vehicle loses **half or more STAMINA** from its starting value, or suffers a 7+ column hit, the Director may introduce critical effects: blown tires, engine failure, brake loss, or fuel leaks.  
- **Cover:** Passengers in vehicles benefit from cover based on Armour and body type; sedans give partial cover, armoured trucks give heavy cover. Motorcyclists have no meaningful cover.  
- **Chases:** Use vehicles primarily as **position and stakes**: gaining distance, cutting off routes, forcing crashes, or herding targets toward ambush sites.

## Faction Vehicle Profiles

These are quick references for what different factions typically drive in 1985 B.C. Use the generic profiles above to stat them.

### Hells Angels & Support Clubs

- **Primary:**  
  - Custom **Harley‑Davidson big‑twin motorcycles** (Motorcycle profile).  
- **Support Vehicles:**  
  - Pickup trucks and **panel vans** for hauling drugs, weapons, and bikes.  
  - Occasional box trucks and tow trucks owned via garages, scrap yards, and towing businesses.  
- **Use:**  
  - Highly visible convoys on highways; quieter runs at night in vans and pickups.

### Big Circle Boys (Triads / BCB)

- **Primary:**  
  - Unmarked **sedans and compact cars** for meetings and collections.  
  - **Panel / cargo vans** and small box trucks tied to import–export or seafood firms.  
- **Maritime:**  
  - **Fishing boats and workboats** operating out of Vancouver, Richmond, and Delta.  
  - Occasional barges or chartered freighters used for high‑value shipments.  
- **Use:**  
  - Blend into legitimate port and Chinatown traffic; containers and manifests matter more than flashy rides.

### Colombian Cartels & Latin American Suppliers

- **Primary:**  
  - **Pickup trucks, SUVs, and sedans** in B.C. (often via local partners).  
- **Maritime/Air:**  
  - **Speedboats** and small fishing boats for coastal drops.  
  - **Bush planes** and light aircraft for remote strips and lake drops.  
- **Use:**  
  - Serve as upstream suppliers; their vehicles are more often seen just outside B.C. or in joint ops with local distributors.

### Yakuza & Japanese Organized Interests

- **Primary:**  
  - **Black sedans and luxury cars** (Sedan profile) used by business‑suit types and visiting “investors.”  
  - Discreet **vans** for bodyguards and equipment.  
- **Use:**  
  - Clean, understated, and often leased through shell companies; little overt flash compared to bikers.

### Street Gangs & Local Crews

- **Primary:**  
  - **Compact cars, beat‑up sedans, and cheap pickups**; many are stolen or borrowed.  
- **Use:**  
  - Drive‑bys, quick getaways, and low‑rent smuggling; vehicles are disposable and frequently swapped.

### Smuggling Networks

- **Primary:**  
  - **Panel vans, box trucks, and semi‑trailers** that look like legitimate freight.  
- **Maritime:**  
  - **Fishing boats, tugs, and barges** along the coast and Fraser River.  
- **Use:**  
  - Specialise in moving “weird cargo” and high‑risk loads for multiple factions, often oblivious to the true contents.

### APEX Consortium

- **Primary Ground Assets:**  
  - Unmarked **black sedans and SUVs/4x4s** with upgraded radios and occasional hidden armour.  
  - **Mobile labs and command vans** based on panel/cargo vans or box trucks.  
- **Air & Sea:**  
  - **Light and utility helicopters** for rapid response and extraction.  
  - Access to “legitimate” **research vessels** and corporate shipping.
- **Use:**  
  - Show up as clean, professional, and over‑equipped; their vehicles may hide experimental tech, robots, or containment pods.

### Canadian X‑COM / Military

- **Primary Ground Vehicles:**  
  - **Pickup trucks, SUVs, and 4x4 wagons** adapted for field teams.  
  - **Box trucks and light military transports** for equipment and captured artefacts.  
  - Where appropriate, treat APC‑style vehicles as **Armoured Trucks** or heavy SUVs with Armour 2–3 and high STAMINA.
- **Air & Sea:**  
  - **Bush planes and helicopters** for remote insertions.  
  - Access to **coast guard cutters and patrol boats** (Fishing Boat / Workboat profiles with better radios and gear).

Use these defaults to quickly answer “what are they driving?” in any scene. Adjust individual vehicles for personality (the flamboyant biker’s candy‑apple chopper, the Yakuza fixer’s spotless black sedan, the APEX van that hums faintly when it’s parked) without changing the underlying stats.
