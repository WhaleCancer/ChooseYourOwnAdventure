# Calm Plant (1)

**Range:** Metres = Harvest Score

**Duration:** Minutes = Harvest Score

Grove Tenders have spent their lives studying the life energies of growing things and how they might be entwined with magical energies, confronting an animate plant is easy for them to deal with. This spell calms such plants, stopping them from attacking. If the plants are under direct control of another being they receive a SKILL test to avoid the effects of the spell. A grove tender may expend more points of Harvest to affect more plants with one casting of the spell, they may affect a number of plants equal to their Magic-Fecundity or, if the plant is a zone or area (a field of Blood Vines for example) they may affect up 10 metres squared per point of Harvest expended.
