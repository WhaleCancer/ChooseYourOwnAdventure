# Commune with Plants (1)

**Range:** 10 metres per point of Harvest score

**Duration:** One hour

This spell allows the grove tender to communicate with nearby plant life. The plants do not become more intelligent but the grove tender is able to interpret their senses to glean basic information about what sort of animals have passed through or occurred within the range of the spell. The amount and quality of the information is up to the Director.
