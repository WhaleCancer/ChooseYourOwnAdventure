# Preserve Herb (1)

**Range:** One dose of plant material

**Duration:** Weeks equal to Harvest score

This spell places a light protective ward on one 'dose' of plant or herb product, preserving it from decay for a number of weeks equal to the grove tender's Harvest score. Although the magic does not require concentration, it is active in a way that limits the grove tender to preserving doses equal to their Harvest score at any one time. The preserved dose is treated as 'freshly cut' for the entire duration of its preservation.
