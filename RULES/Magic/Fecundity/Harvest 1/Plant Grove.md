# Plant Grove (1)

**Range:** One roughly circular patch of land with a diameter equal to the caster's Harvest score

**Duration:** See description

This spell, learned by all grove tenders at the start of their training, enables them to establish their first grove, glade, garden, or other plant-filled space. Casting takes one day per point of Harvest score. During this time, minor interruptions (eating, conversations) are allowed, but the caster must primarily tend to the grove's creation. Serious interruptions (half a day or more) require restarting the process. Once established, the grove possesses all properties of a level 1 grove and expands outwards at a rate of one meter per day until it reaches the caster's designated grove size, provided the caster is present. If the caster leaves, the grove's expansion pauses until their return, though concentration is not required for growth during this stage.

A grove tender can only have one active grove at a time. When a new grove is created, any old grove reverts to a natural environment and will, over time, become indistinguishable from the surrounding wilderness.
