# Woodskin (1)

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Minutes = Harvest Score

Casting this spell causes the target's skin to harden to a woody consistency, reducing all damage except fire damage by one point. It does however impose a penalty of -2 to Acrobatics, Jumping and Running tests as the hero becomes less bendy. The spell also causes the target's skin to become woody in appearance and it is obvious that it has been cast.
