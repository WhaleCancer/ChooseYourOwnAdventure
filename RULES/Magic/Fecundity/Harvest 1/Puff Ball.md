# Puff Ball (1)

**Range:** Metres = Harvest Score

**Duration:** Instant

The grove tender conjures a puff ball and throws it at their opponent. It is not particularly aerodynamic and has a range of 10m. When it lands it detonates, sending choking spores 3m in every direction. Those in the area of effect must test against their SKILL (to dive out the way or hold their breath) or find themselves gasping and choking - they will be at -3 for two rounds as they recover.
