# Pass as Plant (1)

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Hours = Harvest Score

This spell allows Grove Tenders to disguise their animal nature and appear as a plant, preventing attacks while they work. The effect ends if they attack a plant (harvesting small samples for research is not considered an attack). While under the spell, the grove tender's skin becomes mottled with plant-like patterns and colors (e.g., browns, greens), granting a +1 bonus to Sneaking skill in forest, jungle, or other lush environments.
