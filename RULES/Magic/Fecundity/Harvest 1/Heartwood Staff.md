# Heartwood Staff (1)

**Range:** See Description

**Duration:** Permanent

Without killing the tree from which it is taken, the grove tender extracts a staff of living wood imbued with properties based on the level of their grove.

## Heartwood Staff Powers (by Grove Level)

- **Grove Level 1:** Your staff is considered a superior quality weapon (2,2,3,3,3,3,4) and is capable of hurting creatures that can only be hurt by silver weapons.
- **Grove Level 2:** Your staff now counts as a magical weapon and is resistant to normal damage; it can only be damaged by magical weapons and effects or exposure to extremes (so a camp fire will not burn it, but a forge will).
- **Grove Level 3:** Your staff is alive in your hands and each round can add +1 to either your combat roll, damage roll, armour or dodge roll - the grove tender must choose one. It also increases its damage track to 3,3,4,4,4,4,5.
- **Grove Level 4:** You can hurl the staff (use the ranges for a Javelin) using your staves skill for your combat roll. It sprouts legs like a stick insect and runs back to you after one round if not retrieved.
- **Grove Level 5:** Your staff is alive with natural energies; when you hit with it in combat you can choose to inflict 2 points of poison damage or release a blast of choking spores that cause -3 to spellcasting attempts for 2 rounds.
- **Grove Level 6:** Your staff can transform into a Tree Man for a number of minutes equal to your Harvest; if the tree man is 'killed' during this time it reverts back to being a staff.
