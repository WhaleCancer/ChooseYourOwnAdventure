# Transformation-Ancient Oak Treeman (6)

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Minutes = Harvest Score

This spell consumes a seed pod to transform the grove tender into a huge 'ancient oak' Tree Man. This increases their SKILL by +2, STAMINA by +6 and grants them 3 attacks. Each attack is treated as a Mace with double damage. Their armour is Monster Heavy and they are resistant to bludgeoning and piercing attacks (they do a maximum of one point of damage after armour has been applied).

The Ancient Oak Tree Man can move with the same pace as a human and is the size of a large tree - 2-3m across at the base and 9-15m tall. In this form the grove tender gains +4 to their Strength special skill (on top of the base increase in SKILL). They are vulnerable to fire damage, taking one extra point, but not flammable - they can only be set alight by magical or special means such as the use of Fire Oil. When successful with a combat attack - they can attack anyone within 5m of their base - the Ancient Oak Tree Man can choose to grapple an opponent (opposed Strength or Athletics test to escape) and grappled opponents have -3 to their physical skill tests, including combat. Ogre sized or smaller opponents that are grappled can be thrown 3d6 metres away suffering 1d6 points of damage and ending up prone.
