# Wall of Vines (3)

**Range:** See Description

**Duration:** Hours = Harvest Score

Consumes a Seed Pod, which must be within metres = Harvest score of the Grove Tender when the spell is cast, out of which sprouts within one round a thick tangle of thorn vines, occupying a volume of one cubic metre per point of Harvest the caster has. Thus a grove tender with a Harvest score of 9 can create up to 9 cubic metres of hard, thorny vines which could form a barrier across a large corridor, fill a medium sized room up to waist height (or completely fill a small room) or any other shape they wish - the vines must be at least half a metre in thickness though. They can be used to form a bridge (metres equal to Harvest score in maximum length) which will take the weight of 4 human sized creatures (or 2 ogres, or 6 halflings etc).

Once erected the barrier is extremely hard to shove through and full of thorns. It has an effective Strength skill of 12 for anyone wishing to make their way through at a rate of 1m each round and even if that person succeeds in an opposed strength test they take 1d6 points of damage from the wicked thorns. It is not flammable and each cubic metre has STAMINA 14 and is resistant to weapons that crush or pierce, they do 1 point of damage per attack. Only slashing weapons such as swords do normal damage.

The grove tender who created it can pass through the Wall of Vines without a problem and they can allow anyone they wish to pass to do so.

If this spell is cast within the grove tender's own grove or glade it is permanent until they dispel it and they can have a maximum of 100 cubic metres per point of Harvest score as a permanent wall of vines in their glade.
