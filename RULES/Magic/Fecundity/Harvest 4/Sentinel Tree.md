# Sentinel Tree (4)

**Range:** Heartwood Staff

**Duration:** Hours = Harvest Score

The grove tender plants their staff in the ground and commands it to sprout into a broad bush or low limbed tree, radius of 3m, inside which they and their companions may shelter. Inside they are protected from natural heat, cold, rain or other environmental effects and are extremely hard to see (-6 to Awareness tests). Any large or dangerous creature entering the boughs of the plant will alert the grove tender (waking them if they are sleeping) and the tree will try to entangle them with its branches - it has a SKILL of 9 and makes one attack per target each round if they are inside it. Grapple creatures are at -3 to all physical actions.
