# Return plant to life (2)

**Range:** One piece of dead plant material within sight (10 metres per point of Harvest)

**Duration:** Instant

This spell returns a dead piece of plant material to vigorous life, often to the surprise of its current owner. This spell can cause a spear shaft to warp and sprout twigs and leaves, rendering it unusable as a weapon. It can also cause a door or other piece of furniture to suddenly become living, growing wood, warping and twisting out of shape. If the object is magical or held by an owner, they receive a LUCK test to avoid the effects. For 2 additional points of Harvest, the grove tender can affect a larger, more reinforced structure made of dead plant material, such as part of a building or a ship's hull, causing the same effects. The building or structure might not collapse entirely but will certainly be damaged.
