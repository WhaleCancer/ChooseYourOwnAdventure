# Enhance Herb (2)

**Range:** One dose of plant material

**Duration:** Effect lasts for one hour

Doubles the potency of one dose of plant or herb product provided it is used within the duration. At the end of the hour the plant or herb product withers to dust, its natural energies expended. A poison that causes 1d6 points damage and lasts for 3 rounds will now last for 6 rounds, a herb that cures one person of disease will be able to cure two and so on. This spell must be cast on the plant material either before or during preparation, if it requires any.
