# Plant Form (2)

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Hours = Harvest score

On casting this spell, the grove tender takes on the form of a small tree or large bush. They are nearly immobile, able to shuffle along at a rate of 1 foot per round, and are indistinguishable from a normal plant, even on close inspection. A successful Second Sight test will reveal a magical aura but not the true form of the grove tender. The caster remains aware of their surroundings and can change back to their normal form at any time. Being in tree/bush form does not provide any immunities to damage or armour. At the end of the duration, the grove tender can either revert to their usual form or expend one point of Harvest to extend the spell by its original duration.
