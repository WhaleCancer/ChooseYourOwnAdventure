# Grow Seed Pod (2)

**Range:** 10m

**Duration:** 1d3 hours

Allows a grove tender to harvest a seed pod from nearby vegetation. They must be uninterrupted for 1d3 hours as they search for the best, most fertile plants and coax its life energies into producing a seed pod for them. This may take longer (1d6 hours) in areas with little plant life and is impossible if the region is barren (Director's discretion).
