# Grow Seedling (2)

**Range:** One Seed Pod

**Duration:** Minutes = Harvest Score

This spell consumes a Seed Pod to grow a "Chomper Seedling." The creature is described as having a body like a huge cabbage atop a nest of tentacle-like roots that propel it. Its body opens to reveal a mouth full of sharp, thorn teeth and a thick red root protruding like a tongue. Its stats are given as SKILL 6 (Large Bite), STAMINA 7, Armour: 0,1,1,1,2,2,3. Its saliva is a sticky corrosive liquid that deals an extra 1 point of acid damage and imposes a -1 penalty to victims' armour rolls for the rest of the fight as their armour corrodes.
