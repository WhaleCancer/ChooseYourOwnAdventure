# Primal Energy [4]

Primal magic uses the most ancient and basic magical energies, the same energies that were later adopted to power less ancient magical styles. When cast, this spell instantly cancels every non-Primal magic spell (both beneficial and harmful) within 30 yards of the caster. The caster receives 1 Magic Point for every spell cancelled this way, though they cannot exceed their starting Magic Point total. Due to "vast magical fluxes," it cannot be cast more than once per day.
