# Winters Fury [4]

Summons "the full fury of winter" into an area up to 100' in radius (caster can make it smaller). Lasts for as many minutes as the caster has Arcane Mastery score. The area fills with howling winds, driving snow, ice underfoot, and bitterly cold temperatures.

Everyone except the caster in the area takes 1d3 STAMINA damage each round from the cold (armour provides no protection). A -2 penalty to all actions due to sheet ice underfoot. Flight is impossible within the area. Effects stop abruptly at the edge of the spell area; anyone even a foot outside experiences normal temperatures and existing wind/breeze.
