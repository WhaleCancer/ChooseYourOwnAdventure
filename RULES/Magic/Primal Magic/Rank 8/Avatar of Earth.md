# Avatar of Earth [8]

Invests "considerable amounts of power" into one ally of the caster who must be touched for the spell to take effect. The spell takes the rest of the current combat round to take effect. At the start of the following round, the recipient appears "incredibly powerful" to all watchers.

The Hero receives bonuses for a number of rounds equal to Arcane Mastery:

- +2 bonus to Attack rolls, spellcasting rolls, and special skill rolls.
- Damage dealt to enemies is increased by +1 STAMINA from all sources.
- Damage received from enemies is halved (rounded down) before armour is applied.
- Spells cost half the normal amount of Magic Points or STAMINA (rounded down).
- The Hero may take two actions in every round.

This spell may not be cancelled by any means, but may only be cast once in any Lunar month.
