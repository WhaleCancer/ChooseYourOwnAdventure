# Roots of the Mountain [1]

This spell can be cast on one target (or the caster) by touch. The target becomes unable to move their feet, and no force can move them. They cannot remove their footwear. The only way to move their body is to physically break it free of their legs. The target can be "stuck" to a wall or ceiling, but their normal strength applies. If stuck upside down holding a rope, they cannot be pulled down but can only pull up what they would normally be able to lift. The spell ends when either the target or the caster wishes it to end.

If the target attempts to move, roll a d6:

| d6 | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The spell ends |
| 2-3 | No effect |
| 4 | The target takes 1 STAMINA damage |
| 5 | The target is impeded and has a -1 penalty to all actions this round |
| 6 | The target takes 3 STAMINA damage |
