# Titan's Mantle [1]

This spell is cast directly on the caster's body. Upon completion, the caster's skin takes on a stone-like, grey and mottled appearance. Until the following dawn, the caster receives a +1 bonus to all armour tests and counts as having a leather cuirass if no armour is worn. Additionally, a d6 is rolled whenever the caster takes physical damage; on a roll of a 6, that damage is completely negated.
