# Lash of the Volcano [1]

This is an attacking spell that must be cast while the target is standing on the ground. It cannot be used against enemies that fly, are incorporeal, etc. Jumping or climbing are not sufficient to disrupt the spell.

Once cast, a split appears in the ground nearby, and a tentacle of lava shoots out to attack the target. A 2d6 roll must be made against the target's SKILL, with the caster's special skill rating added. If the roll is higher than the target's SKILL, the target is struck for 2 STAMINA damage, which ignores any armor. If the attack misses, the tentacle disappears.

In the following (and subsequent) rounds, the tentacle will repeat the attack if it is still present and the target is alive. This tentacle persists, with its origin moving to follow the target, until it either misses an attack, the target dies, or the caster cancels the spell.
