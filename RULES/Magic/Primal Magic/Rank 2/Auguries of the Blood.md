# Auguries of the Blood [2]

This spell takes ten minutes to cast and requires fresh blood, enough to fill an egg cup. Once completed, the caster stands insensible for a number of rounds equal to their Arcane Mastery. The caster receives one fragmentary vision of the future per round, and as each is received, it can be interpreted by the Director.
