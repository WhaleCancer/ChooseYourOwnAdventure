# Inspiration of the Heroes [2]

When cast, the Primal Mage appears to glow with the power of ancient Gods, causing all allies within thirty yards to grow in confidence. For a number of rounds equal to the caster's Arcane Mastery, all allies (excluding the caster) gain a +1 bonus to their attack rolls, damage rolls, armour rolls, special skill tests, and spellcasting rolls. These bonuses cannot be combined with other spells like Ironhand, and those spells will end when this spell takes effect.
