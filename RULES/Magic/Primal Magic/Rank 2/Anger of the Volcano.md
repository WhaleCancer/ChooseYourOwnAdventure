# Anger of the Volcano [2]

This spell is cast on one target within sight. Immediately, the ground around the target begins to bubble and boil, and lava spits up from cracks, aimed at the target. Each round, the target must roll on a table (see below), even if they can fly or leave the ground. Armour does not apply to any damage inflicted by this spell.
