# Strength of the Heartwood [2]

This spell, cast on a target, lasts until dawn the following day. During its duration, the recipient can (once per round) draw on their inner strength to restore their body. They may reduce their current SKILL by 1 point to restore 1d6 STAMINA. This lost SKILL returns at a rate of 1 point per day, provided the recipient is not under the effects of this spell on that day. If the spell is cast every day, no SKILL will be restored until such castings stop.
