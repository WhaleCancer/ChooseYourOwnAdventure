# Anger of the Heavens [6]

Creates a huge, roiling black cloud above the caster, from which multiple bolts of lightning strike down. Can only be cast outside. The caster may target a maximum number of enemies equal to their Arcane Mastery score, who must be within 100 yards. Every targeted enemy is hit with a bolt of powerful lightning, dealing 3d6 damage. The target may Test their LUCK to avoid the lightning.

If the target has metal armour, they make an armour roll, but the "protective value" is ADDED to the damage inflicted. Leather armour protects as normal. Each enemy may only be targeted once.
