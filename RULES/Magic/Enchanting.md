# Enchanting

Enchantment is a magical skill that may be learned in addition to wizardry or sorcery. To learn Enchantment, a spellcaster must have a rating of at least 4 in their primary magic special skill. Enchantment is the process of creating magical items, from simple items such as potions or more involved items such as magic swords.

## Practitioners

Enchanters are already experienced users of magic who learn enchantment for various reasons. Some sell potions to fund their research, while others are employed by a great lord or king to create magical items for their armies or courts.

## Learning Enchantment

To learn Enchantment, a spellcaster must have a rating of at least 4 in their primary magic special skill (either [Magic-Wizardry](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Wizardry.md) or [Magic-Sorcery](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Sorcery.md)). The [Magic-Enchanting](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Enchanting.md) special skill is then used for all enchantment attempts.

## Enchanting Process

### Workshop Requirements

Enchanting items requires a magical laboratory and workshop, costing 1,000gp per rank of recipe to be constructed. The workshop must be suitable for the type of item being created.

### Learning Recipes

Recipes are found or learned individually, costing 20xp per rank of recipe learned. Recipes for potions are common, while higher-rank recipes and artefacts are more difficult to find and may require entire campaigns to locate.

### Components

Each recipe requires specific components. Potion ingredients are easier to acquire, while artifact ingredients may require a campaign. The Director must create lists of suitable ingredients.

### The Enchanting Roll

The enchanter needs a suitable workshop, compiled ingredients, and must take the listed time. A roll is made against the Magic-Enchanting special skill. A failure means the enchantment fails, but another attempt can be made with the same ingredients. A "double 6" indicates failure and destruction of the ingredients.

Taking more time than listed is possible, granting a +2 bonus to the enchantment roll for each extra time period taken, up to a maximum of +6.

## Item Categories

### Scrolls, Potions & Sundries

**Enchantment required:** 1  
**Cost of recipe:** 50-150gp  
**Cost of ingredients:** 1-50gp  
**Time to craft:** 1 Hour

Potions are transient magical objects that are drunk (or applied to the skin), scrolls must be read by someone with Magical Lore special skill and sundries are very minor objects that are usually used once before their magical energy is used up. All of these items have fairly short production times and can usually be brought from a minor enchanter in many cities.

### Curiosities

**Enchantment required:** 2  
**Cost of recipe:** 200-400gp  
**Cost of ingredients:** 75-150gp  
**Time to craft:** 1 Day

Curiosities are minor magical items that may be used repeatedly, unlike potions, but will have a specific effect or only work under specific conditions. Thus an item may protect against fire damage inflicted by Fire Demons only, but no other creatures, or a crystal ball may only work at midday each day for 10 minutes. Some curiosities have no apparent useful effect at all!

### Trinkets

**Enchantment required:** 3  
**Cost of recipe:** 500-800gp  
**Cost of ingredients:** 200-400gp  
**Time to craft:** 1 Week

Trinkets are similar to curiosities in that they have a specific use, but are generally more powerful and are sometimes destroyed or drained when used. Many trinkets are created with a specific goal or adventure in mind.

### Enchanted

**Enchantment required:** 5  
**Cost of recipe:** 1000-2000gp  
**Cost of ingredients:** 500-1000gp  
**Time to craft:** 1 Month

Enchanted items are much more powerful that trinkets and usually have a permanent enchantment. Magical swords, armour and staves are usually of this class, as are most magical rings. Recipes and ingredients for enchanted items are occasionally available for purchase, but this is rare and the buyer must normally be well known to the seller.

### Artefact

**Enchantment required:** 6  
**Cost of recipe:** N/A  
**Cost of ingredients:** N/A  
**Time to craft:** 1 Year

Artefacts are the most powerful type of magical item, and many Heroes will never even see one, let alone craft one. Artefacts are usually legendary, much sought after and worth a kings ransom! Unlike other recipes, an enchanter may only ever use an Artefact recipe once.
