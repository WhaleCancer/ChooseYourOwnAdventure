# Poltergeist

A Witch is able to siphon energy from the area around them, and transfer that energy into ordinary objects. The control over these objects is very limited, as the Witch just puts energy into them, but the effect can be startling and disorienting for anyone inside.

## Activation

Once per day, a Witch can spend a round summoning the latent magical energies of the local area into all of the small items in an area roughly ten yards in radius. Every small object within this area (coins and larger, up to a pound in weight) will suddenly possess great energy, will fly up from the ground, and will zoom around. The area is centred on the Witch, and if she moves, so does the area.

## Strength

When this power is used, the Director should assign a Strength to the effect (between 1 and 6) dependent on how many small items are in the area, but this cannot be higher than the value of the Magic-Witchcraft special skill. A 1 would be some empty grassland, and a 6 would be a crowded shop. Most normal rooms would be a 3 or 4. The Witch must make a successful Magic-Witchcraft test to activate this power, and it will last for a number of rounds equal to the Witch's Hex value, and at the end of the effect the items will just drop to the floor.

## Effects on Others

Everyone inside the area will be bombarded by random items at speed and from every direction except the Witch and anyone she specifies. Those that are affected must Test their SKILL every round with a penalty equal to half of the Strength of the area (rounded up). Those that succeed can act normally, but any that fail have that same penalty to all of their actions that round (including spellcasting and combat) and will also take damage (armour protects, but dodge does not). This damage should be rolled on a d6, but with a maximum equal to the Strength of the effect. Missile attacks into or out of the affected area are all deflected by the numerous items and will never hit their target.
