# Animation

A Witch, given enough preparation time, can imbue magical energy into a physical object to give it apparent life. These animated forms, referred to as Golem Servants, act as guardians and servants, though they are not as permanent as true Golems. Many take the form of statues, furniture, or even parts of the architecture of the Witch's home.

## Creating a Servant

A Witch can only have one animated servant. The ritual takes at least five days to complete, requiring an hour per day. A successful Magic-Witchcraft test must be made each day. If a day is missed, a test fails, or the ritual is interrupted, it must be restarted. The physical item chosen for enchantment must be at least the size of a dog but no larger than a cow, though its size does not affect its characteristics.

After successful completion, the item gains rudimentary intelligence and can follow basic verbal orders. However, if it fails to complete a task, it reverts to its "item" form and becomes only faintly magical.

## Servant Characteristics

At the time of the ritual the Witch can choose one of the options below for each point they have in the Magic-Witchcraft special skill. An individual option cannot be chosen more than once.

- Upgrade Unarmed attacks to Small Claw
- Upgrade Small Claw to Large Claw
- Upgrade Unarmoured to Light Armour
- Upgrade Light Armour to Medium Armour
- Increase Attacks to 2
- Make servant immune to magical attacks
- Increase STAMINA by +2
- Increase SKILL by +1
- Give servant ranged attack (as Javelin)

The created Servant has a SKILL equal to the MAGIC characteristic of the Witch. It will have a STAMINA equal to the Hex value of the Witch. A Servant will inflict damage as an Unarmed (normal size) attack, will have one attack and will have no armour (unless upgraded).

These Servants will continue their last command, even if their Witch leaves or dies, and are immune to fear, mind control and similar.
