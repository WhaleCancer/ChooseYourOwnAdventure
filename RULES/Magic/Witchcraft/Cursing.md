# Cursing

Cursing is an ability Witches are known for, and it is feared and permanent, unlike a Wizard's "Firebolt" damage which heals. There's little a victim can do to remove a curse apart from the Witch lifting it.

## Laying a Curse

A Witch can lay curses based on their "Hex value." For example, a Witch with a "Hex of 12" can lay up to 12 curses, but may be limited if they have existing curses on escaped bandits.

To lay a curse, the Witch must see and hear the victim, proclaim the curse loudly, and make a successful Magic-Witchcraft special skill test. If successful, the victim can attempt a LUCK test to avoid the curse; failure means they are cursed.

## Curse Effects

The effects of a curse on a victim's characteristics (SKILL, STAMINA, LUCK and/or MAGIC) are permanent until the curse ends. The "Magic-Witchcraft value" of the Witch determines the maximum reduction (one for 1-3, two for 4-6) and that "STAMINA" is reduced by 2 for every point allocated.

For example, a Witch with a "Magic-Witchcraft of 4" can apply 2 points to "SKILL" and one each to "STAMINA" and "LUCK," resulting in the victim reducing "SKILL by 2, STAMINA by 2 points and LUCK by 1." These reductions are permanent until lifted.

An individual can only be cursed once, and if a second curse is attempted, only the more powerful one will apply.

## Removing Curses

A curse ends if the victim dies. The easiest method is for the Witch who laid the curse to touch the victim and proclaim it lifted. Powerful Wizards or Priests can lift curses, potentially for a price.
