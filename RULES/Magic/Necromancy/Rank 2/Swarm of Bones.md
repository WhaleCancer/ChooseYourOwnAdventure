# Swarm of Bones (2)

**Requirement:** The necromancer must be holding a handful of long bones (e.g., arm bones, ribs, or leg bones).

**Casting:** The necromancer throws the bones at one target.

**Target Defense:** The target may not make a Test for Luck.

**Impact:** The bones whirl and fly around the target, distracting and preventing activity.

**Penalties:** Missile fire becomes impossible for the target. Spellcasting and melee attacks suffer a -3 penalty. Missile attacks *against* the target also suffer a -3 penalty.

**Duration:** Lasts for one round per point of Arcane power.
