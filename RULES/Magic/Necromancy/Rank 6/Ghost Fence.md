# Ghost Fence (6)

**Casting Time:** Takes considerable time to cast, involving placing wooden poles topped with skulls. Each post must be within sight of its neighbors, all posts must be placed while the enchantment is underway, with a maximum of 12 posts.

**Activation:** Once active, any living being crossing the fence line activates the magic, causing the skull eye sockets to glow red. Intruders take 1D6 STAMINA damage, and the necromancer is aware of the crossing.

**Defense:** If a living being grabs or strikes an active pole (even with a missile weapon or ranged spell), they take 3D6 STAMINA damage as dead spirits bound within the fence stream towards the attacker. A counterspell can cancel the fence.

**Duration:** If not cancelled, the fence lasts one day per point of arcane power.
