# Raise Undead (6)

A favourite with Necromancers, this spell will animate a corpse with a spark of living spirit, forcing it to return as an undead under the control of the caster. The spell itself takes a whole hour to cast, and requires a corpse of some kind. If the corpse is incomplete, the resulting undead will be missing that body part. The caster must be close to the undead to issue it with orders; Said orders will be followed literally until countermanded by the Necromancer.

By expending different amounts of magic points, different types of undead may be created:

- **Skeleton (6):** The basic form of this spell, creating a skeleton from a corpse.
- **Crypt Stalker (7):** Requires 7 magic points.
- **Skeleton Warrior (7):** Requires 7 magic points.
- **Zombie (7):** Requires 7 magic points.
- **Decayer (8):** Requires 8 magic points.
- **Ghoul (8):** Requires 8 magic points.

A Wizard may have a maximum of four Raised Undead at any one time for every point he has in his [arcane power](../../Wizardry.md#casting-wizardry-spells) (his combined MENTAL characteristic and Magic-Wizardry skill, as described in [Casting Wizardry Spells](../../Wizardry.md#casting-wizardry-spells)).

It should also be noted that Raising Undead is considered an evil act in most lands.

> ## For Necromancers
>
> This spell is also available to Necromancers as [Raise Undead](../../Necromancy/Rank%206/Raise%20Undead.md). A true necromancer can raise 8 undead per point of arcane power (instead of 4).
