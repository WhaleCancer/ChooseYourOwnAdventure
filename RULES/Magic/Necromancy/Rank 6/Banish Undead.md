# Banish Undead (6)

This spell will destroy the lifeforce that animates one single undead, thus returning it to a peaceful rest. Whilst the target may attempt to resist the spell as normal, the test is reduced by the MENTAL characteristic of the caster. An undead creature banished by this spell can never be animated again, so this spell is sometimes cast on the bodies of dead heroes to prevent them ever being raised.

> This spell is also available to Necromancers.
