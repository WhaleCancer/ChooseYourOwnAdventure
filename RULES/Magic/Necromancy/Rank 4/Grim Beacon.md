# Grim Beacon (4)

**Effect:** Causes a ghostly skull to appear above the target's head if a Test for Luck is failed.

**Tracking:** The skull follows the target's movements.

**Duration:** Lasts for 10 minutes per point of arcane power.

**Undead Attraction:** Calls all undead within 10 meters to come and attack the target.

**Undead Behavior:** Undead can sense the Beacon through walls and will try to make their way directly to the target.

**Countering:** A counterspell will remove the Beacon, but any undead already in sight of the target when the spell is cancelled will still attack.
