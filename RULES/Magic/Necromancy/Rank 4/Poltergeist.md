# Poltergeist (4)

**Targeting:** Targets a number of enemies equal to the caster's Magic-Necromancy score.

**Defense:** Each target is allowed a Test for Luck to avoid the effects.

**Activity:** Affected targets become the focus of poltergeist activity, which includes: weapons being drawn from scabbards, arrows scattered, cloths thrown over heads, belts undone, etc.

**Effects per Round:** Each target suffers from one effect each round, determined by the Director.

**Hero Defense:** A hero may test their luck each round to avoid the effect for that round only.

**Duration:** Lasts for one round per point of arcane power. Once successfully cast cannot be cancelled by a counterspell as the poltergeist is already in the world.
