# Grave Stench (Minor)

**Effect:** Causes a touched object or spot to emit a foul odor of rotting and decomposing flesh.

**Impact:** Repulses most animals (except vultures, which may be attracted), makes normal people very uncomfortable.

**Conditions:** More effective indoors (no wind to disperse smell).

**Duration:** Lasts for 10 minutes.
