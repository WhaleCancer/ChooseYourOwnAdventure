# Transcend Death (8)

**Effect:** A necromancer implants a portion of their life force into an object, losing 1 SKILL and 2 STAMINA points. The object radiates a faint enchantment.

**Resurrection:** If the necromancer is killed within the next month and a day, their life force is tethered to the mortal plane by the object and returns to their body when safe, though the invested SKILL and STAMINA points are lost.

**Death Wraith:** If the necromancer's earthly body is totally destroyed, the necromancer becomes a Death Wraith. If the necromancer does not die in the allotted time, the SKILL and STAMINA points are recovered and the spell ends.
