# Assassin's Dagger (8)

This spell is much beloved of evil Wizards, to be used against luckless Characters who have escaped their grasp. When cast upon a known enemy, this spell creates a ghostly hand holding a dagger. This hand immediately sets off directly towards its target at a steady walking pace. Whilst not very fast, the hand is relentless and never stops or rests, and will float ever onwards towards its victim. The hand can be trapped for a short while if the victim is ingenious enough, although this will only ever be short term relief. If the hand does catch up with its victim, It attacks with SKILL 10, but never takes any damage if it loses a combat round. The only way to cancel the curse is to cast a counterspell on the hand (which must be present).
