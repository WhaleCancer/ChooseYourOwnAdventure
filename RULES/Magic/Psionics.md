# Psionics

Psionics is the use of the mind to manipulate the world, serving as a potential aid to Heroes or a dangerous threat from enemies.

## Mental Strength

Psionics uses a new characteristic called "PSIONICS" for heroes, which can be up to 7 for a starting character, similar to how magic points are allocated. Using Psionics (a Primary style) prevents the use of magic; heroes cannot have both. The combined total of Psionics and [Magic-Psionics](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Psionics.md) special skill is referred to as "Mental Strength."

## Psy Points

Psionicists use "Psy Points" to power their abilities. When fully recharged, these are 2 Psy Points for every point of Mental Strength, and they are recovered with a full night's sleep or equivalent.

## Psionic Traditions

A psionicist must belong to one of four traditions: Academic Psionicist, Dark Power, Physical Adept, or Wild Psionics. Each tradition defines how abilities are learned and what they can do.
