# Animal Mastery

Animal Mastery is a type of magic created by Elves, now used by humans, Dwarfs, Orcs, Lizard Men, and the Caarth. It involves animal-based spells and powers, contrasting with "Marrangha" by being infused with the power of original, untwisted animals.

## Practitioners

Spellcasters with Animal Mastery are drawn to the "Animal Court" or have a mystical connection to a chosen creature. They are called "Beastmasters" and "Animal Mages." A spellcaster with the [Magic-Animal Mastery](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Animal-Mastery.md) Special Skill picks one animal type as a guardian and power source, determined by choice or a random roll on a Sample Animal Table.

Beastmasters and Animal Mages are a variable group, often taking on characteristics of their chosen animal over time.

## Bestial Power

Animal Mastery spells are cast like Wizardry spells. No components are needed. Animal Mages record their spells in a spellbook. A spellcaster learning Animal Mastery cannot cast traditional Wizardry or Sorcery spells but can learn the Minor Magic Special Skill. The combined MAGIC plus Magic-Animal Mastery special skill is called "Bestial Power."

## Modifiers Unique to Animal Mastery

- Animal is Beastmaster's chosen type: +1
- Animal is related to the chosen type: -2
- Animal is not Beastmaster's chosen type: -4
- Animal is not in chosen Habitat: -2
- Animal is in completely different Habitat (e.g. Ice instead of Desert): -4

Beastmasters' power and effect vary based on the size and shape of their chosen animal.

## Variant: Plant Mastery

Plant Mastery is a variant of Animal Mastery, practiced by figures like the "Master of Gardens" or "Mistress of Pines." Spellcasters using Plant Mastery are identical to Animal Mastery users, but their spells focus on a particular type of plant or fungi.
