# Minor Magic

Some magic has been developed to make the life of the magician just that little bit easier. These Minor Magic spells (also known as Cantrips) are easy to cast and low in effect. Adventurers find them useful, and some travelling conjurers make a living entertaining villagers with them. Cantrips are easy to learn and cast, and require very little magical power.

## Learning Minor Magic

To learn Minor Magic spells requires a MENTAL characteristic of at least 1, and at least 1 point in the Magic-Minor skill. A Character starts knowing 3 Minor Magic cantrips for every point they have in the Minor Magic skill. These cantrips should be chosen when the Character is created.

## Casting Minor Magic

To cast a Minor Magic spell requires a standard spellcasting roll with a bonus of +6 to reflect the ease of casting. A spellcaster's total of his MENTAL characteristic and his Magic-Minor skill is referred to as his "Incantation" score.

### Casting Modifiers

Some additional modifiers may also apply:

| Cantrip Casting Situation | Modifier |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| Each round of preparation | +2 |
| Quiet surroundings | +3 |
| Not under attack | +0 |
| Caster is Target of 1 ranged attack | -1 |
| Caster is Target of >1 range attacks | -2 |
| Target of 1 melee attack | -2 |
| Target of >1 melee attack | -4 |

If the spellcasting roll succeeds, the cantrip is cast and no magic points need be deducted. If the spellcasting roll fails, one magic point must be expended. If a double 6 is rolled on the spellcasting roll, 2 magic points must be deducted.

## Acquiring New Cantrips

To acquire new cantrips, a caster need simply increase his Magic-Minor skill. Each additional point gained will allow the caster to choose three more cantrips, either immediately or at some time in the future. A Character may not have more than three cantrips per point in the Magic-Minor skill.

**Play Tips:** Minor Magic cantrips will not usually defeat enemies or create powerful effects. They will however make the life of a magician somewhat easier. The starting selection of spells should be chosen carefully however, as many of these spells can come in very useful in specific situations. These spells can even be useful for a non-magician Character, although the acquisition of these spells will of course come at the expense of other abilities. It is probably a good idea to try and choose a "theme" for the minor magic spells known, and the Instil cantrip is often a good choice.

## Minor Magic Cantrips

Listed below are the common Minor Magic spells. This list is by no means exclusive and the Game Master should feel free to add to this list.

### Attraction

This cantrip makes the target find one other person seriously attractive. The caster must either touch the target or Instil this cantrip into a drink. The subject of the attraction need not be present but if not the caster must know the subject reasonably well. The cantrip will last an hour or so, and will usually override any previous feelings held by the target towards the subject. However, this cantrip will not force the target to act completely out of character.

### Burn

This cantrip creates a small flame in the palm of the caster's hand, lasting up to one minute if desired. This flame can be used to light a candle, lantern or campfire, or will do one point of STAMINA damage if applied to an unaware target. This flame will of course damage anything held by the caster in that hand, but can be dispelled simply by closing the hand into a fist.

### Cool

This cantrip will cool one object or person down. If used on a living being, the spell will not cause any freezing damage, but will make a being feel cool or even cold, regardless of the ambient temperature. If used on an inanimate object, the temperature may be taken down almost to freezing. As usual, an unwilling target may Test for LUCK to avoid the effects. Regardless of the target, the effects will last for 3D6 minutes (rolled in secret) after which the surrounding temperature will start to reassert itself.

### Dry

This spell will instantly evaporate all of the water from one inanimate object such as an item of clothing, book etc. Although this cantrip will not affect oil, it will affect all water-based liquids.

### Enhance

This minor illusion improves the appearance of a small item or group of items. This could make rotten food appear succulent or an old and battered item appear new and shiny. A successful test against Awareness or a successful test for LUCK will allow an observer to see through the deception. The effects will last 1D6 minutes (rolled in secret).

### Entertain

This cantrip will cause a small visual illusion to appear on the caster's outstretched hand. The illusion will be reasonably detailed, and may perform any actions that the caster desires, as long as they take place on the caster's hand. The illusion will last 2D6 minutes, and is mainly used by travelling conjurers to earn a few small coins.

### Extinguish

This cantrip will put out a small fire, usually the size of a lamp or candle flame in size. The spell caster needs to be able to see the flame to extinguish it. Larger flames, up to the size of a campfire, can be extinguished, but have a penalty of -1 to -3 to the spellcasting roll. Flames are extinguished immediately, although smouldering embers may remain. This cantrip will not work on any sort of magical flame.

### Glimmer

Creating a Light in the darkness is useful for all adventurers. The Wizardry spell "Light" is able to create a bright light suitable for reading or illuminating a wide area, but sometimes all that is needed is a faint light. This cantrip creates a dim glow, either on the hand of the caster or a small object, lasting for 2D6 minutes. This glow is equivalent to that given out by the embers of a fire, and will illuminate an area enough to see large shapes in the gloom.

### Hear

This cantrip allows the caster to listen in on a conversation that he can see, but may be out of earshot. Whilst the spell is active (which is either one conversation or 2 minutes, whichever is shorter) the caster can only really hear the target conversation. If the conversation is being conducted at a whisper, there is a penalty of -2 to the spellcasting roll.

### Heat

This minor magic spell will heat up one object or being. As with the Cool minor magic spell, this will not inflict any damage. When used on an inanimate object, that object may be heated up to what a person would regard as "very hot". When used on a living being, their temperature may be increased so that they feel hot, equivalent to being in full sun in a tropical area. An unwilling target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, and like Cool, the effects will last 3D6 minutes (rolled secretly).

### Hold

This cantrip fixes one small object in place for 30 seconds. This could include sticking a sword in a scabbard, attaching a boot sole to the floor or even sticking a rider's trousers to a saddle! An unwilling target may Test for LUCK to avoid the effects of this spell.

### Honesty

When this cantrip is cast upon a target, who must also be touched as the spell is cast, the result is that the target admits one lie they have just told. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, and must have told a lie in the very recent past. If several separate lies have been told, the Game Master decides which one is admitted.

### Inebriate

When this spell is cast and the target touched, the target immediately becomes very, very drunk. The target may of course test for LUCK to avoid the effects, but if this test is failed, the target will have a penalty of -2 to pretty much all actions. The drunkenness will wear off after an hour or so, but can also be removed with the Sober cantrip or a counterspell. The Instil cantrip can be used in conjunction with this one to make a mug of beer or other drink very potent indeed!

### Instil

This very useful cantrip allows the caster to introduce the effects of one minor magic spell into a drink or food. The Instil and effect cantrips must be cast at the same time, and the magical effects are retained for 1D3 days. When the food is eaten or the drink drunk, the spell takes full effect.

### Jab

When this minor magic spell is used, the caster must lightly touch the target with an extended finger. The target will then feel like they have been firmly jabbed with a sharp stick. This spell may cause 1 STAMINA point of damage (a roll of 6 on 1D6), which will be unaffected by any armor worn. If the caster desires, this spell may be used from a distance of up to 5m away with a -2 modifier to the spell casting roll.

### Mend

The Mend cantrip will repair small holes in wooden, metal or cloth items. A suitable patch is required to actually fill the hole, this cantrip merely securely fixes the patch in place. As this cantrip only fixes a single small hole, it could not be used to repair a broken sword or cracked shield.

### Mistake

This cantrip must be cast on one target within eyesight, who may test for LUCK to avoid the effects. If the test is failed, the target makes a small mistake. Whilst it will not affect combat, it will however cause someone to make a mistake when writing something down, take a wrong turning, mix the wrong two potions together or mis-weigh an item to be bought or sold. The Game Master may rule that this spell does not work if the effect is too major, or may apply a modifier to the spell casting test.

### Noise

This auditory illusion causes fairly indistinct but appropriate noises to be heard coming from a short distance away. This could be footsteps, murmuring voices, rustling bushes or the squeaking of a door. Targets may not test for LUCK, as the sounds actually exist!

### Pied Piper

This cantrip forces a nearby group of pests to follow the caster for 2D6 minutes (rolled secretly), although the caster cannot otherwise control them. When the spell ends, the vermin act as normal for their type. This spell can affect up to 10 rats, 100 beetles or 500 flies. To increase the numbers affected will incur a -2 penalty to double, a -4 penalty to treble, a -6 penalty to quadruple etc.

### Pucker

This annoying cantrip will cause the mouth and cheeks of one target within 10m to pucker uncontrollably. The target may test for LUCK to resist, but if the test is failed the target will not be able to eat, drink or talk easily. Any social skills that rely on speech will suffer a penalty of -2, as do any spellcasting attempts. This cantrip will last for 1D3 minutes.

### Push

Without any overt actions, this cantrip will allow the caster to push one item or person. The target can be up to 10m away, and the force exerted will be roughly equivalent to a real physical push by the caster. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects. If affected, the target will stumble, suffering a small penalty to physical actions that round (-1 or -2), but is in most danger if standing near the edge of a cliff or river.

### Repulsion

This cantrip is the opposite of the Attraction Minor Magic spell, making the target take an instant dislike to a specified person. This dislike will not necessarily be violent, but will be a strong emotion. Like Attraction, the spell affects a touched target (or can be Instilled), the subject of the Repulsion must be present (or known to the caster) and the effects will last for 1 hour.

### Ripen

This enchantment will cause inedible food, such as unripe fruit, rotten meat or mouldy bread, to become edible. This will affect one single item of food such as a single apple or joint of meat, and the food must be touched for the spell to work. This spell can also reverse the effects of a Sour spell.

### Secrete

This spell allows the caster to steal one small object without even seeming to touch it. The caster must be close enough that he could touch it, and anyone actually watching the item will see it vanish, but not where it goes to. The item, which should be around the size of a gold piece, will appear in the caster's pouch or pocket as desired.

### Slip

This spell causes one target within 10m to slip, as if on a banana skin under-foot. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, which will generally amount to a -2 penalty to physical actions for one round. If the target is running however, they will require a test against SKILL or go sprawling.

### Smudge

This cantrip causes the writing on one page to become blurred, smudged and unreadable. The caster need merely cast this spell and touch the document in question. The smudge can be restored by casting a counterspell on the page, but otherwise the smudging is permanent.

### Sober

This spell, much beloved of any caster who spends too much time with Dwarfs or adventurers, will instantly sober up one intoxicated target. Simply requiring one touch, this spell can also be Instilled into a potion for instant sobriety!

### Sour

This cantrip will spoil a single container of food or drink, up to the size of a barrel. The container must be touched as the spell is cast, and the food will be soured immediately. Although not poisonous, the food will cause severe stomach ache if eaten. This spell will not affect any sort of magical or enchanted food.

### Spark

This spell will cause a small but painful spark of electricity to jump from the caster's fingertip up to 10cm away. Although the spark will cause no real damage, it is painful and will cause the target to jump. This spell is most useful for getting a domestic animal moving, or getting a dawdling person out of the way.

### Stutter

This cantrip will cause the target to stutter uncontrollably whenever they try to speak on one particular matter (determined by the caster). The effects will last for up to two minutes, and completely prevent the target talking about the matter in question. As is usual with this type of spell, the target must be within 10m of the target, and may test for LUCK to avoid the effects. This spell will not work on spell casting of any kind.

### Weather Protection

This useful cantrip will protect the caster from the worst of the weather for 1 hour. In driving rain, the caster will be merely damp. In biting cold the caster will be chilly, and in blazing sunshine the caster will be warm and a bit red. This cantrip can really increase the comfort level of a travelling magician, but if the weather is really terrible, the caster will still need proper protection.

### A winning Smile [Always costs one MP]

This spell gives you +1 skill when making SKILL – BARGAIN roll. As a reaction when you make a SKILL - BARGAIN roll, you modify the result by 10%, if you succeed.

i.e. you sell three short swords for 30g. As a reaction, you may cast 'A Winning Smile', if you succeed to get an extra 10% on the sale price. Thus, if you BARGAIN to sell 100gp of goods, and you win with this cantrip in effect, you get 110gp.

### Ethereal Pocket

This spell, which lasts for an hour, creates a small interdimensional space. One small object (no heavier than a few pounds in weight or longer than a six inches in length) may be secreted away. Only one of these spells may be active at any time. i.e. if the caster uses it on themselves, they cannot cast on another person. Whilst active, the targeted object cannot be subject to 'pickpocket, theft, pilfering, searching or removal by any nefarious means. At the end of the duration, the item will reappear in the right hand of the caster.

If the caster invests 1MP, which is lost, even if the spell succeeds, the duration may be extended to 24hr. This spell is very useful for keeping a special item very safe. If someone has the Second Sight skill, a successful check will reveal the location of the pocket to them.

### Applause

For the vainglorious mage, this minor magic spell causes a ripple of applause and cheering to be heard just after they cast their next spell (not minor magic). The 'real' spell must be cast within 3 rounds of casting Applause to have the effect apply.

### Good as New

When cast upon a non-magical item, it is cleaned to the point where it appears to be new. May be cast once per day, and may only be cast on one item per day A rusty, old, beaten and broken goblin short sword may be repaired and cleaned to look like it is new. After 2 days it will become apparent the weapon is defective (It will look like it did before this spell was cast).

### Chutney

By means of this spell the caster may turn raw ingredients into RATIONS. For the cost of two (2) encumbrance slots of 'ingredients' the caster has in their possessions, they may cook, cool and congeal them into one PROVISION with no fire or ice available. The process takes ten minutes. The Chutney appears anywhere within 30cm of the caster, at the caster's choice. If there is a suitable receptacle ready (an open glass jar or some such), the 'Ingredients' are immediately turned into Chutney. If there is no receptacle within reach the 'Chutney' lands on the ground with a splat.

### Hammer Finger

Allows the caster to use their fingers to hammer in nails that won't come out for one minute, after which time the nails can be removed as ordinary nails. They must have nails available to use, the spell does not create them.

### Hot Towel

Allows the caster to shape the facial hair of a recipient. Requires a towel or similar cloth heated to nearly scalding temperatures, placed on the face of an ally or themselves. The towel must remain in place for five minutes. If removed before five minutes, the spell is cancelled. After five minutes, the recipient can immediately select any desired facial hair design. At the Director's discretion, this cantrip can provide a +1 or +2 bonus to social skill tests like Etiquette, Disguise, or Con, depending on the chosen style.

### Knot

A cantrip cast by tying a knot, making it untieable for one minute. A SKILL test is required. If successful, the knot becomes a normal knot after the minute duration ends. If failed, it falls apart after the minute is over.

### North

This spell only works outdoors. The caster spends one minute observing the environment. After one hour, the caster knows which direction is North.

### On a Roll

Provides an additional +1 morale boost to anyone attacking in combat, affecting their next physical action, including combat. Can only be cast on a target that has just scored a critical attack roll.

### Smoke Rings

Allows the caster to create small, shaped smoke figures (e.g., smoke ships or a rabbit). Requires a pipe or other smoking instrument. Lasts for one hour, or for the duration of an evening if the caster remains within a comfortable, well-furnished drinking establishment with a good fire, ale, and decent food.

### Sniff (Dwarf Only)

Cast as a reaction with an Awareness roll. When underground, the dwarf can sniff the air, wipe walls, and discern dust thickness to estimate the age of rooms. Upon entering an enclosed room, an Awareness roll can be made. If successful, the dwarf can immediately determine how long it has been since someone last disturbed the area. If a party opens a crypt door, a Dwarf immediately makes a 'Sniff (Awareness)' roll. If successful and the spell is cast, they get a fairly accurate estimate of when the room was last occupied.

### Spectral Dunce Hat

Forms a hat on the target's head. One round after it's cast, the hat contracts and causes one point of damage. The hat appears like a dunce's hat and remains visible until it contracts and causes damage. Can only be cast on a target that has just fumbled any SKILL or MAGIC roll.

### Splice

Allows sections of rope to be spliced together to form longer ropes. The splicing is permanent and is as strong as the weaker of the two ropes joined.
