## Description

This spell takes an entire round to cast, with effects lasting for a number of rounds equal to MAGIC plus Magic-Demonology.

## Effects

Once cast, the caster's face warps and twists and becomes that of a terrible Demon, fearsome to behold. Every round thereafter, the caster can stare at one enemy (without taking an action), and that target must Test their LUCK or flee in fear on their following action.
