## Description

This is a risky spell often used by Demonologists under attack. It takes a full round to cast, then opens a portal to Hell, allowing one or more Demons to come through.

## Effects

A roll is required to determine the Type of Demon that appears:

| D6 | Type | Number |
|:---|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | I | 2-12 |
| 2-3 | II | 1-6 |
| 4-5 | III | 1-3 |
| 6 | IV | 1-2 |

Tables in Chapter 2 are used to determine the exact Demon form, and only one actual Demon form will appear. For example, if "Demonspawn" is rolled, there will be 2-12 Demonspawn.

The summoned Demon(s) will be angry and will attack anyone within the area randomly. They will not vanish until killed.
