## Description

This Ritual summons a Messenger of Death, used to bring a slow but certain death to a specific target. Blood and hair (or other bodily parts) from the target must be used, but once complete a Messenger of Death will appear. Without a further word, the Messenger will stalk off to find its designated target. The Messenger will vanish when its task is complete.
