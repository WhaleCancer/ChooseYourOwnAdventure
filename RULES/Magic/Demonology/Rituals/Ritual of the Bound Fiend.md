## Description

The Conjurer sprinkles Demon blood in a crude circle while chanting words of binding. Most Demons recognize and react to this ritual.

## Effects

Upon completion, the Conjurer must make a Magic-Conjuration Test with a penalty equal to the Demon's Essence (a +3 bonus applies if the Demon's true name is known). Success binds the Demon to the Conjurer's will for a year and a day, or until the Conjurer dies or releases it. Failure can lead to trouble for the Conjurer.
