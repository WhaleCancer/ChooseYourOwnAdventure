# Psionic Oops Table

This table is used when a psionic ability fumbles (rolls a 12 on the activation test).

| 2D6 | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | Psionicist is thrown into the air, suffering temporary skill reduction (1D6+1 points) from major injuries due to psionic power ripping out of their body |
| 3 | The psionicist's temporary psionics are reduced by 1D6, recovering at 1 point per day |
| 4 | The psionicist and all persons within 3 meters lose 1D3 Attack Rounds of activity, stunned by an uncontrolled psionic wave |
| 5 | If the ability was targeted at an enemy, it affects the psionicist; if targeted at a friend or self, it affects the nearest enemy |
| 6 | The psionicist loses the normal Psy Points for the ability, plus one extra Psy Point, as the ability fails |
| 7 | The psionicist experiences a minor annoyance, such as a strange change in appearance, odd sensations, or uncontrollable twitching |
| 8 | The psionicist is stunned and loses their action for the next Attack Round |
| 9 | The ability fizzles out, and the psionicist loses an additional 1D6 Psy Points on top of the normal cost |
| 10 | The psionicist loses 2D6 Psy Points. For each point lost, a nearby living being takes 1 stamina damage, affecting the nearest being first, then the next nearest, and so on |
| 11 | A burst of psionic ability occurs, dealing damage from the Psionics Damage table to all within short range of the psionicist. Armour does not protect against this damage |
| 12 | The temporary psionics characteristic is reduced to 0 and recovers at a rate of 1 point per week |
