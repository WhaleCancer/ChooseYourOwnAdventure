# Telekinesis

This ability allows the adept to manipulate, lift, or move objects at a distance (within sight, as long as the item is clearly seen). It costs 1 Psy Point and a full round to activate.

- **Rating 1:** Push a button, move a small lever, or pick up a knife.
- **Rating 3:** Wield a sword, and even attack with it (using the lower of the ability rank or Swords Special Skill).
- **Rating 6:** Lift a hefty person and their equipment or push over a Golem or other heavy creature.

A single action can be extended over several consecutive rounds, not exceeding the power's rating.
