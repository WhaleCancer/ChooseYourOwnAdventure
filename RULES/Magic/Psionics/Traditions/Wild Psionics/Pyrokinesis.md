# Pyrokinesis

A Wild Psionicist with this ability can ignite flammable material within sight using the power of thought. Requires a full action to use and a successful test. At the end of the round, with the expenditure of 1 Psy Point, the material will burst into flames. For the first few rounds, the fire's extent depends on the ability's rank. After that, the fire may spread, grow, or go out, depending on the material ignited.
