# Psionic Pulse

Similar to Wild Burst, but produces an expanding wave of mental power, a "weird psionic pulse." Does not affect living things, but causes damage to magical creatures (Golems, Demons, Elementals, Undead) and inanimate objects (walls, buildings, boats, etc.). Requires a full action to use, a successful test, and costs 3 Psy Points. The Psionic Damage Table is used, but damage to large things like ships, buildings, and fortifications is quartered. Armour provides no protection against this ability.
