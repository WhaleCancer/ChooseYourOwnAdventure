# Magical Flux

This ability crosses the boundary between Psionics and Magic, creating a random effect. When used, the psionicist rolls once on the Random Spell table (from the Heroes Companion) to determine the spell effect. The spell must be "cast" immediately. The Psionicist can choose the target of the spell.
