# Psychic Evasion

This ability allows the psionicist to avoid attacks and can replace the Dodge Special Skill in or out of combat. It is always active and can be used in response to an attack. The psionicist spends 1 Psy Point to make a Dodge roll, using the ability's rank as the Dodge rank. A new D6 roll is made, and the best protection from either armour or this ability (but not both) is applied to the damage. This ability can be used in the same round as another psionic ability.
