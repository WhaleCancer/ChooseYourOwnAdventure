# Psychic Blade

This ability summons a glowing energy blade of pure psychic force. It can take various forms, sometimes requiring an attuned handle or generating a blade attached to a wrist. It takes a full round to activate or deactivate and costs Psy Points. Once active, the psionicist can attack using the Swords Special Skill. The blade uses the Psionic Damage table with a bonus equal to the ability's ranks. Armour can protect against this attack. If the blade inflicts at least 1 stamina damage, the psionicist must spend 1 Psy Point; otherwise, it cannot inflict damage.
