# Communicate

Allows a Wild Psionicist to understand and be understood by almost any sentient being. Does not grant knowledge of the language, ability to read/write it, or understanding of other language uses like magical talking objects or animals. Combines the psionicist's language knowledge with the target's language from their minds for translation. The ability's rating is used as a language rating (like a Language Special Skill). Does not require an action to activate, but needs a successful test. Costs 1 Psy Point per conversation.
