# Block Damage

This ability takes a full hour to activate or deactivate, requiring a successful test but costing no Psy Points. Once active, it protects the psionicist against damage from attacks and other effects. It automatically triggers when the psionicist takes damage, reducing the damage by 2 stamina points at a cost of 1 Psy Point (after an Armour Roll, even if the residual damage is 1).
