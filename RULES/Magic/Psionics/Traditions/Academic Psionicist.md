# Academic Psionicist

This tradition is "collegial and organized." Academic Psionicists are trained in schools and colleges of magic, where they learn theory, research lore, and conduct experiments.

Potential psionicists are identified and trained in two ways: either teams travel to locate and mark individuals for future training, or individuals present themselves at schools/colleges later in life.

The abilities developed by this tradition are considered "Classic" psionics, focusing on mental detection, communication, and control.
