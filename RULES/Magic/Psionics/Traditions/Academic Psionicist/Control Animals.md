# Control Animals

This ability requires a full round to activate and costs 1 Psy Point. The target of this ability must be a non-sentient animal or creature, with an Intelligence of Average or below. A successful psionics roll is required to activate the power, with a penalty equal to half the skill of the animal. If successful, the psionicist can exert a measure of control over the animal, as determined by the level of ability. The psionicist must concentrate fully on the control, and once this concentration lapses, the link is broken, and the power deactivated.

- **Rank 1** allows gentle control sufficient to make the animal pause for a round in an attack, or come a bit closer than it normally would, etc.
- **Rank 2** allows emotion control of the animal, making the animal angry, friendly, frightened, etc. The animal will then react to this emotion.
- **Rank 3** allows the psionicist to direct the animal to take normal actions, though the psionicist cannot dictate exactly how the action is to be executed.
- **Rank 4** gives full control as long as the suggested action would normally be taken by the animal.
- **Rank 5** allows total control, although the animal will not take obviously suicidal actions.
- **Rank 6** allows complete and utter control of all actions of the creature.
