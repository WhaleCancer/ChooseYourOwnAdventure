# Mind Shield

This ability takes a full round and 1 Psy Point to activate with a successful test. Once active, it blocks mental control, mind-reading, and similar psionic powers directed at the psionicist, as well as scrying attempts in the immediate area. Only powers with a lower rating than Mind Shield are blocked, and each blocked power costs an additional 1 Psy Point. If no powers are blocked for a full minute, another Psy Point is expended to maintain the power, which can be deactivated at any time at no cost.
