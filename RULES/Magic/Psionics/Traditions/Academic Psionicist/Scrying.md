# Scrying

When activated, this ability allows a psionicist to see, hear, or even smell at a distance, even through walls or in the dark. It takes a full round to activate and requires a successful test. Once active, the psionicist must close their eyes and concentrate for a full round to sense as if they were in the remote location. The power costs 1 Psy Point per minute (or part thereof) and remains active as long as Psy Points are spent, even without active scrying. The psionicist can specify a distance and direction (e.g., 5 metres straight ahead) or a known location (e.g., The Black Lobster Tavern, Port Blacksand) each round. As long as the location is within range, the psionicist senses as if they were there (with basic Dark Seeing). This ability can be blocked by holy or magical wards.
