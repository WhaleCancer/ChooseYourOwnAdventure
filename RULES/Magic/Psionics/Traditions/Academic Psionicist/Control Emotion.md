# Control Emotion

This ability requires a full round to activate and costs 1 Psy Point. The target, who must be visible to the psionicist, can resist if they are a sentient being. If the ability succeeds, the Reaction of the target towards either the psionicist or one other person (or even object) within sight can be altered.

Reactions can be changed by 1 step for each point the psionicist has in this ability. For reference, the Reactions are: Friendly > Neutral > Unfriendly > Hostile

Reactions may be improved or worsened by this ability, but once changed, this ability may not be used on the same target until the target has slept (or equivalent).
