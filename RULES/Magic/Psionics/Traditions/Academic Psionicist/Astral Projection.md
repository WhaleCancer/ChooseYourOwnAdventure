# Astral Projection

This ability allows the psionicist's spirit to leave their body and travel at a normal walking speed. Activation takes a full round, during which the body slumps into a coma. It costs 1 Psy Point and requires a successful test. The "ghost" can pass through walls and vacuum without ill effects, though spiritual or magical barriers might prevent access.

The psionicist cannot have any physical effect on the world whilst astral but may still use other psionic abilities. However, every minute spent in astral form costs another Psy Point and if these points are all used up while the psionicist is away from their body, they must make an immediate Astral Projection test or die from the shock!
