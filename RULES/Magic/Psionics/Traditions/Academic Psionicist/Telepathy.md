# Telepathy

This ability allows the psionicist to communicate mentally with another sentient being who is either known personally or within sight (range determined by ability level). If both psionicist and target share a language, communication is in words; otherwise, it's in feelings and emotions. The target cannot block communication unless they have an appropriate ability or magical item, but they do not have to respond. This ability does not grant mind reading, allowing the target to remain silent if they wish.

A successful roll is required to activate the link. This ability costs 1 Psy Point and takes a full round to use, although once activated, the link can be maintained at no further cost until broken. The psionicist cannot use other psionic abilities whilst a link is active.

- **Rank 1:** The ability can be used in the same room.

- **Rank 3:** Has a range of 500 kilometres
