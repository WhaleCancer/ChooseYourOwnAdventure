# Precognition

This ability grants the psionicist a "gut feeling" about future events. It requires a full round to activate and a successful test. The psionicist can spend Psy Points, up to their ability rank, to ask a question about the future (e.g., "what would happen if...", "will X happen?"). The Director provides information based on the Psy Points spent, noting that the future is not accurately predictable and visions may not come true.
