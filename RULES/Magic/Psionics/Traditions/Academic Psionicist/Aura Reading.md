# Aura Reading

Activating this ability uses a full round, requires a test, and costs 1 Psy Point. The psionicist can read the psychic aura that surrounds all sentient beings. The target of this ability will not be aware that they are being examined. The amount of information acquired will depend on the rank of the ability, with all lesser rank information also being read.

- **Rank 1** gives the current major emotion (fear, anger, etc.).
- **Rank 2** gives a rough idea of the current intentions of the target.
- **Rank 3** provides a more accurate idea of the target's intentions.
- **Rank 4** gives a general description (in two words) of the personality of the target.
- **Rank 5** provides a comprehensive overview of the character of the target.
- **Rank 6** allows the psionicist to read the main surface thoughts that round.
