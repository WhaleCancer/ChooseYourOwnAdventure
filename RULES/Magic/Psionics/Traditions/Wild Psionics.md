# Wild Psionics

This tradition is barely under the control of its practitioners, rarely taught, and usually self-learned by those with natural ability but no access to a formal tradition. It serves as a natural outlet for the build-up of psychic energies. Many abilities in this tradition are damaging to enemies and expensive in Psy Points. Wild Psionicists tend to "burn brightly and briefly."
