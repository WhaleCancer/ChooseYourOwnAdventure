# Impossible Moves

This ability allows the adept to perform nearly impossible physical actions. Examples include leaping a 15-meter-wide chasm, springing along a taut vine or tree branch, running up a sheer wall, and springing from ledge to ledge. The minimum cost is 1 Psy Point per action, which can, at the Director's discretion, span more than one round. The psionicist can spend more than 1 Psy Point to make more impressive moves, up to the ability's rank. For instance, a 6-point Psy Point spend could allow the adept to leap a 150-meter-wide chasm or climb the tallest city tower in a couple of rounds.
