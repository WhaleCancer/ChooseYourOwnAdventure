# Dark Power

This tradition is one that may not always be known by this name but could be considered evil to learn and to use. Of course, a Director may decide that this tradition is not evil in their setting or is only evil if used for malicious ends. This tradition is normally taught by a master to an apprentice and will rarely if ever be taught in a formal setting.
