# Drain Life

This dangerous ability inflicts 1 stamina point of psychic damage to every sentient target within range. The ability takes a full round to activate and costs 1 Psy Point. A successful test is also required.

Once activated, a wave of psychic energy expands outwards from the Dark Psionicist and damages everyone within range, whether friend or foe. Armour will not protect against this damage. A Dark Psionicist cannot exempt anyone from the effect unless they are physically touching them.

- **1 point** = 2 metre range
- **2 point** = 3 metre range
- **3 point** = 6 metre range
- **4 point** = 15 metre range
- **5 point** = 30 metre range
- **6 point** = 100 metre range
