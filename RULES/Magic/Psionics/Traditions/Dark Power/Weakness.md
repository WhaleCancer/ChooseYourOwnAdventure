# Weakness

This ability temporarily drains a target's energy and vitality. It requires a full round and a successful test to activate on a single target within sight. For a number of rounds equal to the Dark Psionicist's points in this ability, the target suffers a skill penalty equal to half the ability's rank (rounded up). The psionicist doesn't need to use an action to maintain it, nor does the target need to remain in sight. Only one target can be weakened at a time. Each round the power is active costs 1 Psy Point.
