# Choke

This ability takes a full round to activate and requires a successful test. The Dark Psionicist can make a grabbing motion and one target within sight will begin to choke. On this first and subsequent rounds, the target takes Psionic Damage (see the Psionic Damage Table) until either the Dark Psionicist stops concentrating, or the target moves out of sight, or the target dies.

However, this ability cannot be maintained for a number of rounds exceeding the ability rating. This ability costs 1 Psy Point per round and the target also suffers a penalty of -1 to all actions whilst choking. Armour provides no protection against this ability.
