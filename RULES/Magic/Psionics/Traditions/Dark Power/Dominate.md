# Dominate

Using this ability, the Dark Psionicist can force a target within sight to act against their will, in a way demanded by the Dark Psionicist. The ability requires a full round to activate, and then the Dark Psionicist and target must both make opposed psionics tests, although a non-psionicist can make a skill test instead. If the target loses, they will be under the control of the Dark Psionicist for a number of rounds equal to the ability score.

The Dark Psionicist does not need to issue a verbal command each round, but for each command, they must spend a Psy Point. If the target moves out of sight, the Domination ends.
