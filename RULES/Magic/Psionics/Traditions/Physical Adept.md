# Physical Adept

This tradition uses psionic energies to enhance a psionicist's physical prowess. All abilities in this tradition affect only the adept and not other targets. Unlike other traditions, the adept must already possess a good level of physical ability for these enhancements to be effective.

Physical adepts are sometimes quasi-religious, often trained in monasteries or temple retreats, and experienced adepts may take on apprentices.
