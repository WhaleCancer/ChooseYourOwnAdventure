# Transform (8)

This is a "nasty spell" known for turning Heroes into creatures like frogs, cockroaches, or mice. If the target fails a Test for Luck (or chooses not to test), they permanently transform into a small or large creature of the caster's chosen Animal Mastery form (e.g., a Master of Horses could transform someone into a foal or a Warhorse). The victim's clothes and other possessions are not affected and drop to the ground. The transformed victim retains their knowledge and consciousness but can only speak an animal language. The caster can reverse the spell by touching the target and willing it; otherwise, only a Counterspell can reverse the transformation.
