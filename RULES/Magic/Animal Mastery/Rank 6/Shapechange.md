# Shapechange (6)

A power for Animal Masters and Beast Mages, allowing the caster to change into (and back from) a target animal or creature once per day. Clothes and equipment are included in the change, which takes a full Attack Round. The caster retains full intelligence. If the creature's normal SKILL is higher than the caster's, the caster gains a +1 bonus to their SKILL while transformed, but retains their STAMINA score. The caster gains non-magical abilities like flight, extra attacks, or armoured hide.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> This spell works identically, changing the caster's shape into a chosen type of plant or fungi.
