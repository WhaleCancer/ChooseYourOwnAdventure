# Creature Copy (4)

This spell allows the caster to conjure an exact duplicate of any target creature of their chosen type. The duplicate possesses the same SKILL, STAMINA scores (at the time the spell is completed), and powers as the original. The duplicate is under the caster's control and can be commanded to attack the original creature. The creature copy exists for one battle only, disappearing afterward.

The spell works on creatures up to the size of a Water Buffalo or Warhorse. For larger creatures, multiple "Creature Copy" spells may be required. As a rough rule, for every 5 STAMINA points (or part thereof) above a STAMINA score of 10, an additional "Creature Copy" spell is needed. For example, a creature with a STAMINA score of 18 would require three spells. Each "Creature Copy" spell costs 12 Magic Points, assuming the caster has a rough idea of the creature's STAMINA score. If the score is unknown, the caster may need to repeatedly cast the spell over two or more Attack Rounds until the duplicate is complete, requiring the caster to have effective protection during this time.

If the original creature has suffered damage when the spell is cast, the copy will also have that damage.

> This variant works identically, but multiple "Creature Copy" spells may be needed if the caster wishes to recreate a copy of something large like a big tree.
