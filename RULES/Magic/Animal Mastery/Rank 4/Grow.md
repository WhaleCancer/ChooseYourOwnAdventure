# Grow (4)

When cast, the target animal immediately grows half as big again (e.g., a two-meter horse grows to three meters). The increased size grants the target the benefits of a Strength spell, and any harnesses and armor will grow to match the wearer. The spell lasts for 3 minutes but can be cast multiple times on the same target animal. An additional casting on the example horse would increase its length to four and a half meters and provide the benefits of two Strength spells.

An unwilling target animal receives a Test for Luck. Alternatively, this spell can be used to increase the size of a small animal (like a normal wasp) to a large or giant one (e.g., a Giant Wasp).
