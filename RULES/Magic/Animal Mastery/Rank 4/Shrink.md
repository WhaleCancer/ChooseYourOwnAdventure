# Shrink (4)

This spell is the reverse of "Grow," shrinking the target animal to half its normal size. It can be cast multiple times to further reduce size. While under its effects, the target animal suffers from a Weakness spell due to its small size. The spell lasts for 3 minutes or until cancelled. It can also be used to shrink large or giant animals to a normal size (e.g., a Giant Wasp to a normal wasp).
