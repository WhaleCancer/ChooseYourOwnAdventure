# Magic Companion (4)

Casting this spell grants the caster a power chosen from the list below, which must belong to the caster's chosen animal. This spell will last for thirty minutes regardless of which animal power is deployed, or until cancelled by the caster or a Counterspell.

Available powers:

- **Armour:** The caster gains the same armor type as their chosen animal, typically Monster Medium or Heavy Armour. The caster cannot already be wearing any armor for this spell to take effect.
- **Breathe:** This spell allows the caster to breathe effectively in any environment, including underwater, on land, or in oxygen-poor or relatively airless environments. It will not work in a complete vacuum but will double the caster's survival time compared to a regular human in such a situation.
- **Camouflage:** The caster gains camouflage abilities like their chosen animal (color-changing skin or cryptic pelt patterns), becoming nearly invisible when stationary, and receiving an additional +4 to their Sneak Special Skill rolls.
- **Climb:** The caster gains gravity-defying climbing ability like their chosen animal, allowing them to move at twice their normal speed when climbing and gaining an additional +4 to their Climb Special Skill rolls.
- **Disease:** The caster's ability to transmit disease like their chosen animal when fighting unarmed. If the target is wounded, they must Test their Luck to avoid contracting the disease, in addition to suffering regular damage. The disease is identified as "Red Plague," causing large, hot-to-the-touch red blotches that spread over the victim's skin. The victim loses 1 STAMINA per day for 2-12 days, and this damage cannot be healed or restored while infected. If the victim survives, the blotches fade, and lost STAMINA can be recovered normally. Multiple hits do not cause cumulative infection effects.
- **Endurance:** The caster gains the endurance and resilience of their chosen animal. For the spell's duration, the caster suffers no STAMINA damage from adverse environmental conditions and requires no sustenance from food or water. However, any meals eaten during this time do not count towards the 2 Meal a day limit for restoring STAMINA points.
- **Fly:** This spell allows the caster to fly in any direction at a running pace, with full control over movements. The caster gently floats to the ground when the spell expires and can carry a weight equivalent to what they could comfortably carry on foot.
- **Gills:** The spell creates a magical pair of gills on the caster's neck, enabling underwater breathing. A warning is included that these gills bypass normal breathing, so if the caster is not underwater, they may suffocate.
- **Ink:** The caster gains the ability to create a five-meter radius circle of absolute inky darkness centered around them. This area of darkness does not move and cancels out both normal light and the Dark Seeing Talent. The darkness can be cancelled by a Light spell or a Counterspell but otherwise lasts for the duration of the spell.
- **Jump:** The caster gains the ability to jump great distances as per their chosen animal. This spell allows the caster to jump over a wall or across a pit at will, with no chance of slipping or falling. A caster can jump a horizontal distance equal to quadruple their height and a vertical distance equal to twice their height. No run-up is required, and carrying a heavy load or wearing armor has no effect on the jump distance. Casters can also execute a "jump attack" in combat instead of fighting; if they win an Attack Round, they knock their opponent over, who then spends the next Attack Round getting up.
- **Large Bite/Claws/Horn/Tusks:** The caster gains a powerful attack like their chosen animal, but this spell only works if the caster is unarmed. All successful hits inflict "Large Bite/Claw STAMINA damage."
- **Poison:** The caster gains a venomous attack like their chosen animal when fighting unarmed. If the caster wounds their target, they deliver poison damage in addition to regular damage. The poison is fast-acting and immediately delivers STAMINA damage equal to 2 plus the number of Magic Points put into the spell. An example is given: a spellcaster using an additional 6 Magic Points would create a poison inflicting 12 points of STAMINA damage.
- **Running:** The caster gains the running speed and ability of a chosen animal, moving at twice normal speed and gaining a +2 bonus to Running Special Skill rolls.
- **Strength:** The caster gains the strength of a chosen animal, providing a +2 bonus to Strength Special Skill rolls and Damage Rolls in hand-to-hand combat.
- **Swim:** The caster gains the swimming speed and ability of a chosen animal, moving at twice normal speed in water and gaining a +4 bonus to Swimming Special Skill rolls, with no combat penalties in water or other liquid.
- **Tongue:** A sticky tongue attack that hinders opponents. If an enemy is wounded, they must Test for Skill, and if unsuccessful, they are entangled. They suffer a -2 penalty to their SKILL until they win an Attack Round and sever the tongue.
- **Web:** Allows the caster to create a strong web up to 5 meters in diameter, binding and immobilizing anyone within it. Strong victims (like Trolls or Giants) can break out in two Attack Rounds, and Heroes with Strength Special Skill can break out after two successful Strength tests. Others must wait five minutes to be freed.

> While plants may seem to offer limited powers compared to animals, imagination can expand them. A Master of Vines might use Climb, Tongue, or Web powers; a Master of Fungi might use Disease or Poison powers; and a Master of Trees might deploy Armour, Endurance, or Strength powers.
