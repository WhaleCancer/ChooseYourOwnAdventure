## Description

A Beastmaster who has learned all available Animal Mastery spells and has a Magic-Animal Mastery Special Skill of 6 can construct this artifact. It is a silver amulet worn around the neck, taking the form of the Beastmaster's chosen animal type.

## Powers of the Amulet of the Masters

- **Control animal or plant:** The wearer can make up to six unfamiliar animals or plant monsters in the immediate vicinity react as if Friendly for 60 minutes. During this time, they can be commanded to do anything reasonable, such as leaving the area or attacking a nearby enemy.
- **Summon animal or plant:** The wearer can summon 1-6 animals or plant monsters to aid them in battle, provided the creatures are local to the area (e.g., a wizard with a Wolf Amulet cannot summon wolves underwater but can summon Snow Wolves in mountains). The summoned creatures serve for up to one hour or until slain.
- **Talk to animal or plant:** The wearer can speak and understand the languages of animals or plant monsters represented by the Amulet.
- **Immune to animal or plant:** The Amulet wearer is immune to attacks and special abilities of animals or plant monsters represented by the Amulet. An example is given: a mage wearing a Scorpion Amulet would be immune to the venomous stings of all Scorpions.

## Usage

Beastmasters wearing their own constructed Amulets can continuously activate all powers without effort, provided they use them conscientiously to avoid revocation. Anyone else wearing such an Amulet can use each power once per day for up to an hour, only if they are a spellcaster and make a successful Magic Special Skill roll. An Amulet-wearing Beastmaster may not attack another Amulet-wearing Beastmaster, though they may fight to defend themselves.
