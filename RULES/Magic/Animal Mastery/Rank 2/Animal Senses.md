# Animal Senses (2)

Casting this spell grants the caster a special animal sense chosen from the list below. The sense must belong to the caster's chosen animal. This spell will last for thirty minutes regardless of which animal sense is deployed, or until cancelled by the caster or a Counterspell.

Available senses:

- **Call:** The caster receives the distinctive call of their chosen animal type and can communicate with any similar animals nearby, unless restrained or muffled.
- **Darkseeing:** The caster receives the benefits of the Dark Seeing Talent, enabling sight at night and underground. This Darkseeing is monochrome, has a maximum range of twenty meters, and in absolute darkness, only broad features are visible, making reading or distinguishing fine details impossible.
- **Farseeing:** The caster gains the eyesight of an eagle or other long-visioned creature. They receive a +3 bonus to all sight-based Awareness tests and can see for many kilometers, assuming line of sight.
- **Listen:** The caster receives the excellent hearing of their chosen animal type. They cannot be surprised, and anyone attempting to use a Sneaking Special Skill against them does so at a -4 penalty. They can hear distant conversations and discern the number and type of approaching enemies by "putting an ear to the ground or wall."
- **Smell:** The caster receives the superior sense of smell belonging to their chosen animal type. They cannot be surprised, and anyone attempting to use a Sneaking Special Skill against them does so at a -4 penalty. They can smell trails and detect nearby entities and discern the number and type of any who have passed this way simply by putting a nose to the ground.
- **Sonar:** The caster receives excellent sonar capabilities. They cannot be surprised, and anyone using a Sneaking Special Skill against them does so at a -4 penalty. They can detect distant disturbances and discern the number and type of approaching enemies simply by concentrating. Anyone attacking a Beastmaster employing their Sonar sense receives a -1 penalty to their Attack Strength.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> Plants have a much more limited palette of senses when compared to animals. Plant senses include: Listen, Smell and Sonar. Some monstrous plants may have Call or Darkseeing if they can make noises (such as Whistle Buds) or have eye-like organs (such as Bark Biters).
