# Restrain Creature (2/4/6)

This spell will bind the target animal or animals in bands of magical energy, fixing them in place even if they are airborne! Once bound, the target cannot move a muscle although they can still breathe. Even gravity will not affect a Restrained target, so a falling creature or leaping combatant could both be fixed in the air. The spell lasts for three minutes, and normal physics will take over when the Restraint is removed.

- **2 Magic Points** restrains a single small animal of the chosen type.
- **4 Magic Points** restrains up to 6 small animals or swarms or a single large or giant animal of the chosen type.
- **6 Magic Points** restrains up to 6 large or giant animals of the chosen type.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> This spell is basically most effective on either plant or fungi monsters that actively attack their prey. It is also useful on negating the defensive mechanisms of plants or fungi that may have spore or pollen attacks when disturbed by intruders.
