# Control Animal (2/4/6)

When cast, this spell will make up to six chosen animals or swarms in the immediate vicinity to react as if Friendly. The effects last for 10 minutes. During this time, animals can be commanded to do anything within reason, such as leave the area or attack a nearby enemy (though the control will wear off if the enemy is outside the area of effect).

- **2 Magic Points** controls a single small animal or swarm of the chosen type.
- **4 Magic Points** controls up to 6 small animals or swarms or a single large or giant animal of the chosen type.
- **6 Magic Points** controls up to 6 large or giant animals of the chosen type.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> This spell is basically most effective on either plant or fungi monsters that actively attack their prey. It is also useful on negating the defensive mechanisms of plants or fungi that may have spore or pollen attacks when disturbed by intruders.
