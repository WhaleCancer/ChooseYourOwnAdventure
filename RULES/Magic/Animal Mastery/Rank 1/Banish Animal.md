# Banish Animal (1/2/4/6)

When cast this will cause a creature of the Beastmaster's chosen type to either leave the immediate area, or, if previously summoned magically by the caster, to vanish back from whence it came. If Banish Creature is cast on a creature summoned by a different spellcaster, it is equivalent to a Counterspell and will cost an extra Magic Point to cast.

- **1 Magic Point** banishes a single swarm or small animal of the chosen type.
- **2 Magic Points** banishes up to 6 swarms or small animals of the chosen type.
- **4 Magic Points** banishes a single large or giant animal of the chosen type.
- **6 Magic Points** banishes up to 6 large or giant animals of the chosen type.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> This spell works identically, causing the plant or fungi to simply vanish (perhaps reappearing at a later time) or teleport away from the caster in a random direction or distance.
