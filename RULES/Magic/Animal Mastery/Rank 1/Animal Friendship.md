# Animal Friendship (1)

To cast this spell, the wizard simply intones a mystical word of command. The caster can make up to six unfamiliar animals or swarms in the immediate vicinity react as if Friendly. The effects last for 10 minutes and during this time the animals will not attack the caster, though they cannot be commanded to do anything else. If the caster or their comrades attack any Friendly animal, then the spell is instantly cancelled.
