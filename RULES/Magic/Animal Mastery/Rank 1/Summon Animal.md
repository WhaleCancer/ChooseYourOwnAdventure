# Summon Animal (1/2/4/6)

When cast, this spell summons a creature of the Beastmaster's chosen type, appearing instantaneously nearby or from another dimension. The creature(s) serve the caster faithfully for one day or until slain, obeying all reasonable commands. An unreasonable command ends the summoning and may revoke the Beastmaster's magical status.

- **1 Magic Point** summons a single swarm or small animal of the chosen type.
- **2 Magic Points** summons up to 6 swarms or small animals of the chosen type.
- **4 Magic Points** summons a single large or giant animal of the chosen type.
- **6 Magic Points** summons up to 6 large or giant animals of the chosen type.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> This spell works identically to Summon Animal, but causes the plant or fungi to simply vanish (perhaps reappearing later) or teleport away from the caster in a random direction or distance.
