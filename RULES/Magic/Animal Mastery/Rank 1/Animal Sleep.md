# Animal Sleep (1/2/4)

This spell will put to sleep any target animal(s) or swarm(s) depending on the amount of Magic Points invested in the spell. The target(s) can Test their Luck to avoid the effects of the spell. The target(s) will be in a normal sleep for five minutes, but may still be woken by loud noises, injury, being shaken, etc. A Hero may automatically kill most sleeping opponents, although this is considered bad form in most cases, and may lead to the revocation of the Beastmaster's powers. It is otherwise identical to the Sleep spell.

- **1 Magic Point** sends a single small animal or swarm of the chosen type to sleep.
- **2 Magic Points** sends up to 6 small animals or swarms or a single large or giant animal of the chosen type to sleep.
- **4 Magic Points** sends up to 6 large or giant animals of the chosen type to sleep.
