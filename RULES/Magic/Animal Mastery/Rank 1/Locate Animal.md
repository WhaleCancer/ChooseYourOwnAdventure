# Locate Animal (1)

This spell is similar to "Detect Animal" but offers greater precision, revealing a rough direction and distance to the closest chosen animal type. It has the same range and duration for the sensation (ten minutes) and requires recasting if animals move. It reveals nothing if no animals are in range.

> ## Plant Mastery variant
>
> This spell works identically for plants or fungi, and is easier because they cannot move.
