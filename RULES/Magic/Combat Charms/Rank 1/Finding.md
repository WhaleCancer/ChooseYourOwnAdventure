# Finding (1)

Helps the caster locate any physical thing or place. It provides the compass direction to the nearest item of the specified type (e.g., "a Gold Piece"). It does not provide accurate directions or distance. For finding a dungeon exit, it points to the nearest exit regardless of what lies between. The sensation of direction lasts for one minute.
