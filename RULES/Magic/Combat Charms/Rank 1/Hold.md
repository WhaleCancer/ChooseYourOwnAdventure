# Hold (1)

Holds the target object or creature still within a field of magical energy, fixing them in place even if they are airborne. The target may receive a Test for Luck to block the spell. Once bound, the target cannot move a muscle but can still breathe. Gravity does not affect a Held target, meaning a falling boulder or leaping combatant could be fixed in the air. The spell lasts for three minutes, and normal physics resume when the Hold spell is removed. Up to 3 cubic metres may be affected by this spell.
