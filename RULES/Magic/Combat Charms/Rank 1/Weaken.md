# Weaken (1) Combat Charm

This spell drains the strength, agility, and motivation of one enemy. It can be cast against a target within 5 meters, who may Test for Luck to avoid its effects. If affected, the target's stamina is reduced to half its listed value. If the target survives combat, lost stamina returns at 1 point per minute. This spell can also be cast outside of combat.
