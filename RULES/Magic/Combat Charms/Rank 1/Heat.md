# Heat (1)

Heats up one object or being. If used on an inanimate object, it can be heated to what a person would consider "very hot." If used on a living creature, their temperature increases to feel hot, equivalent to being in full sun in a tropical area, potentially causing the loss of 1 stamina point if the caster desires. An unwilling target may Test for Luck to avoid the effects. The effects last 3D6 minutes (rolled secretly).
