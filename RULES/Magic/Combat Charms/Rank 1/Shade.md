# Shade (1) Combat Charm

This spell summons a spirit warrior, a tattered SHADE, to fight in the caster's place. The Shade has skill 7, stamina 4, 1 Attack, and uses a Small Claw weapon. In combat, the Shade's attributes are used instead of the caster's. If the Shade is defeated, the caster continues combat with their own scores. If the Shade wins the combat, it disappears.

Up to 2 extra Magic Points can be invested, each adding 2 skill and 2 stamina to the Shade's scores. This spell can also be cast outside of combat, summoning a Shade to serve the caster faithfully for three minutes, following all instructions except suicidal or ridiculous ones.
