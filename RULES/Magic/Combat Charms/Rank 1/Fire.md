# Fire (1)

The caster may cause a flame, equivalent to a torch. The flame can appear anywhere within 3 metres and lasts for up to 1 minute. If created on a person or flammable object, the target takes 1D3 damage per Round and may ignite. The more flammable the object, the more effective the spell. While the original magic fire disappears when its time is up, any secondary fires caused by this spell will continue burning.
