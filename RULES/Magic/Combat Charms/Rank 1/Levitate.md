# Levitate (1)

This spell removes gravity's effects from the caster, another being, or an inanimate object. Unwilling targets can Test for Luck to resist. When active, the target can float up or down at walking pace under the caster's control. The levitated being can pull themselves sideways with handholds and may be affected by strong winds. The spell lasts one minute, after which the target gently floats back to the ground.
