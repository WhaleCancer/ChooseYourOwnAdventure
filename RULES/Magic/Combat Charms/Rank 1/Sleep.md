# Sleep (1) Combat Charm

This spell can put opponents to sleep in combat. For each opponent, roll one die for each point of stamina they possess; if any roll is a 6, the spell has no effect on that opponent. If no rolls are 6, the opponent falls asleep for the duration of combat. Sleeping opponents are treated as defeated but can be woken by loud noises, wounds, or shaking. A practitioner of Combat Charms can automatically kill a sleeping opponent, though this is considered bad form. The spell can also be cast outside of combat, causing victims to slumber for 5 minutes before waking.
