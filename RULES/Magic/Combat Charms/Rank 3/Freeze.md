# Freeze (3)

When cast, one target is frozen solid in ice, unable to move or speak, but can still breathe, see, and hear. The target can attempt a "Test their Luck" to avoid the effects. After ten minutes, the target thaws and returns to normal, but suffers 1D3 stamina damage. Attempts to speed up defrosting with fire or heat will increase damage. This spell can also freeze water or water vapor into ice, working best where water is already present. It affects an area up to three square meters and lasts for 10-60 minutes.
