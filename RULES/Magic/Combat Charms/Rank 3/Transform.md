# Transform (3)

Described as a "particularly nasty spell" that has featured in legends and folk-tales. If the target fails their "Test for Luck," they are transformed into a small, inoffensive creature of the caster's choice (frogs, cockroaches, or mice). Their clothes and possessions are not affected and drop to the ground. The victim retains knowledge and consciousness but can only speak in an animal language. The caster can reverse the spell by touching the target and willing it, otherwise a "Counterspell" can reverse the transformation, or it will wear off in 10-60 minutes.
