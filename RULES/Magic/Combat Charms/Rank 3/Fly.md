# Fly (3)

Described as a more powerful version of the Levitate spell, allowing the caster to fly in any direction at a running pace with full control for 5 minutes. Upon expiration, the caster gently floats to the ground and can carry a weight equivalent to what they could comfortably carry on foot.
