# Rot (3)

This spell causes the instant decay of one large wooden or metal item (like a barrel or wagon) or several smaller items (like manacles or leather bindings). Wood rots, metal rusts, etc. The item must be within 10 meters and cannot be magical. If the object is being held or worn by someone, they are allowed a "Test for Luck" to avoid the effects.
