# Quake (3)

This spell causes a small but powerful and localized earthquake up to 30 meters in diameter. The ground heaves and shakes, damaging buildings, demolishing rickety ones, and potentially collapsing caves or dungeons. Large cracks open in the ground, and all beings within the area must "Test of Luck" or fall into one. Characters who fall into a crack are stuck until the earthquake subsides. Those who avoid falling must "Test for Skill" to stay on their feet. Only the caster is immune. The earthquake will last for 10 seconds. Thus victims who are swallowed up by cracks or knocked down may recover on the Attack Round after the earthquake stops.
