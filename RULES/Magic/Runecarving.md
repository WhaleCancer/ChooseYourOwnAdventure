# Runecarving

Rune Carvers (also called Engravers or Spell Swords) use rune engraving to cast spells. This process is slower but allows for quick spell use while wearing heavy armor. The origin of rune carving is attributed to earth elementals teaching Dwarves, with the skill spreading to other races. Runes are a form of elemental language, each containing power from elements, and are typically carved onto materials like stone or metal.

## Runic Knowledge

Rune Carvers develop a MAGIC statistic and a [Magic-Runecarving](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Runecarving.md) skill, which combine to form their "Runic Knowledge" score, determining rune power. They can also learn Magic-Minor.

## Rune Powder

To "hold" magic, special "rune dust" or "rune powder" is needed, made from crushed gems, semi-precious stones, silver, and gold leaf shavings, making it expensive. A reinforced leather bag of rune powder, costing 40gp and containing enough for 20 runes, occupies half an equipment slot.

## Creating Runes

Runes are created by carving or engraving and activated by uttering their name. The magic is tied to the creator, meaning only the rune carver can deliberately trigger them, similar to casting a spell with appropriate sounds.

Engraving a fresh rune takes one hour per point of Runic Knowledge. Runes appear as intricately curved and knotted designs, reflecting the elemental language; for example, water runes are flowing and wavelike, while earth runes are thicker and solid.

## Empowering Runes

Empowering a rune takes 10 minutes per point of Runic Knowledge. During this process, the Rune Carver works powder into the design, focuses on its purpose, and charges it with magical energy. This is akin to casting a spell, subject to wizardry magic restrictions like armor penalties. A casting roll is made at the end of the empowering process.

A carved rune can be "refreshed" using rune powder, which is worked into the design with channeled magical power. This is faster than carving a new rune but still slow, incurring the same penalties for armor as wizardry magic. Rune powder is consumed upon spell casting.

## Rune Activation

The language for releasing or activating a rune is a form of Elemental, similar to ancient dwarvish. Silenced Rune Carvers cannot use their runes. If their speech is hindered (e.g., choking, dazed), the Director may require a test against their Magic-Runes special skill to cast.

A second spell casting roll is required for activation. This roll only fails on a result of 12, which causes a harmless burst of elemental energy (flash of flame, gust of wind, spray of dust or water) but does not require an 'Oops' table roll.

Activating a rune is instantaneous and cannot be done accidentally. It involves speaking the rune aloud while envisioning its form.

## Runes

The runes listed below are the most common runes known. There will be other runes, so the Game Master should feel free to add in new runes as required.

The numbers listed for each rune refer to the Runic Knowledge required.

## Permanent Runes

The greatest practitioners of the art can engrave runes upon items that are permanent and recharge from the natural energies that float around Kern, providing one use of the rune each day or more for exceptionally powerful items. Thus, many magical items found on Kern derive their power from Rune Carving. The rune must be interpreted and understood so that its activation word (in the elemental language that is close to ancient dwarvish) can be pronounced. Magical items of any kind are rare but amongst that category, rune engraved items are relatively common.
