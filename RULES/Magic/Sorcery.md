# Sorcery

Sorcery is a magic style initially developed in the Old World, but now disseminated across the whole of Titan. Sorcery uses the same arcane energies as Wizardry, but instead of distilling these energies from the surrounding environment to power spells, Sorcerers draw energy from their own bodies. Thus Sorcery spells are powered by STAMINA rather than magic points and a Sorcerer will only use magic points if he also knows minor magic spells.

One consequence of this approach is that some spells require physical foci, or components, for the spell to work properly. Whilst many of these components are easy to obtain, some are much rarer. The primary consequence of Sorcery is that using spells depletes the caster's own physical reserves, possibly leaving them more vulnerable to attack. Unlike Wizardry, Sorcerers learn all of the spells available during their training.

## Casting Sorcery Spells

Sorcery Spellcasting follows the standard procedure, with a test being made against the total of the caster's MENTAL characteristic and Magic-Sorcery skill. This total, for Sorcery, is referred to as the Sorcerer's "Inner Strength".

As with the other magical styles, certain modifiers will apply to the spellcasting test:

### Casting Modifiers

| Sorcery Casting Situation | Modifier |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| Each continuous round of preparation | +2 |
| Quiet surroundings | +3 |
| Not under attack | +0 |
| Caster is Target of 1 ranged attack | -1 |
| Caster is Target of >1 range attacks | -2 |
| Target of 1 melee attack | -2 |
| Target of >1 melee attack | -4 |

As with Wizardry, a roll of double 6 will result in an automatic spell failure and will also require a roll on the Oops table. However, unlike Wizardry, the wearing of armor does not affect Sorcery spells. A Sorcerer will still require the Armor skill to receive the full protective benefit from the armor though.

## Components

A Sorcerer must always have a component if one is required, and there is no way to cast one of these spells without. The required STAMINA is deducted immediately after the spell is cast, and it is entirely possible for a Sorcerer to knock himself unconscious with the casting of a more powerful spell. It is also worth noting that casting a Sorcery spell does not cause wounds, only weakens the essential life force of the Sorcerer. Thus the Healing skill will not be able to restore STAMINA lost through spell casting, although food, sleep, a Healing potion or priestly ability would.

A final word on components. Some, such as Gold-backed mirrors, Galehorns or Pearl Rings, can be purchased from suitable vendors or found as treasure. Others, such as sand and pebbles, may be selected in nature at no cost. Components such as Beeswax or Goblins Teeth can be harvested from a beehive or goblin corpse. It is suggested that a Game Master allow only one lump of wax or tooth be harvested from each of these sources. Some components will be consumed during the casting of the spell, whilst others can be reused indefinitely.

The availability of components is of course one mechanism whereby the Game Master can restrict the availability of Sorcery spells. It is also one of the major restrictions on the power of a Sorcerer.

**Play Tips:** There are certain advantages and disadvantages to being a Sorcerer. Sorcerers start knowing all the spells, and will never have to learn new spells. Even though some of these will require components, Sorcerers will have a much larger repertoire early on, and even in later stages of a campaign. A Sorcerer is also less reliant on a high MENTAL characteristic than a Wizard. Although a Sorcerer must still test their MENTAL to cast spells, they do not require magic points. This, combined with the ability to wear armor, means that the Sorcerer can be reasonable in combat or other situations.

On the downside, a Sorcerer powers their spells with STAMINA, meaning that a Sorcerer must have a reasonable STAMINA to begin with, but even so, casting several spells can severely weaken a Sorcerer and leave them vulnerable in a fight. Sorcerers can however wear armor, and so can often hold their own in a hand-to-hand fight.

## Sorcery Spell Descriptions

Listed below are all of the Sorcery spells that each Sorcerer knows. Each spell is listed as a 3 word name, a system devised by the earliest Sorcerers, along with any required components and a spell description. Unless specifically noted otherwise, the components are not consumed.

Many of the spell effects are dependent on the Sorcerer's "Inner Strength". This again is the total of the caster's MENTAL characteristic and his Magic-Sorcery skill.

### ZAP (4)

**Component:** None

One of the more powerful Sorcery spells, ZAP fires a large bolt of lightning at one target within 30m, causing 3D6 points of STAMINA damage. Armor is of no use against this spell, and the target does not receive a test for LUCK.

### HOT (4)

**Component:** None

The HOT spell fires a large ball of fire at one target within 30m, bursting on impact into a 3m radius circle of fire. Anyone caught within the radius of effect will take 1D6+1 points of STAMINA damage. Especially flammable targets will find themselves ignited by this spell, as will flammable objects.

### FOF (4)

**Component:** None

When cast, this spell creates a personal and impervious barrier a couple of inches from the caster. This barrier will block attacks from both inside and outside, and will also block all spells. This barrier will last for a number of minutes equal to the caster's Inner Strength, and will move with the caster at walking pace during this time.

### WAL (4)

**Component:** None

This spell will create a 3m x 3m wall of magic that will block anything physical passing through from either direction. This wall cannot be moved once created, but will stop all physical objects, and will even stop a falling building or landslide!

### LAW (4)

**Component:** None

This spell will only work on creatures with Low or No intelligence. Lasting a number of rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength, this spell will completely dominate the target's intelligence, effectively leaving the target under the complete control of the caster. The target will of course receive a test for LUCK, but need not speak the same language as the caster. This spell will allow the caster to order the target with almost any actions, although anything completely out of character will not be obeyed. The target must stay within eyesight of the caster for the spell to continue to work.

### DUM (4)

**Component:** None

This spell will make the target (if it fails a test for LUCK) badly uncoordinated and clumsy. As with many Sorcery spells, the effects will last for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength. Outside combat, an affected target will drop handheld objects on a roll of 1-3 on 1D6. This should be checked each round. In combat, a target will fight at a penalty of -2 and will fumble on any double. If a double 6 is rolled, the victim must make two rolls on the fumble table.

### BIG (2)

**Component:** None

This spell will instantly grow the caster to double their normal size. The caster now inflicts double normal damage with all hand-to-hand effects, but will make all physical tests (except Strength) with a penalty of -2 due to the difficulty of coordinating such a large body. This spell will last for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength.

### WOK (1)

**Component:** A gold coin

Whilst casting this spell, the Sorcerer places the gold coin on his wrist, and the coin becomes a large magical shield. The shield has no weight, and acts in all respects as a large shield. The shield will last for a number of minutes equal to the Sorcerer's Inner Strength, and then disappear, along with the coin.

### DOP (2)

**Component:** None

This spell will open or unlock any one door or chest, even if the door is barred instead of locked. The door or chest to be opened must be touched by the Sorcerer as the spell is cast.

### RAZ (1)

**Component:** Beeswax

As the Sorcerer casts this spell, the beeswax must be run along the cutting edge of a bladed weapon. The weapon becomes super sharp for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength, adding +2 to all damage rolls with that weapon. The portion of beeswax is consumed by the spell.

### SUS (2)

**Component:** None

When cast, the Sorcerer is made aware of any trap or ambush within 10m. This spell will actually detect all traps and ambushes, even those not laid for the caster! The Sorcerer will be aware of the direction and rough distance of each threat, and will know whether the threat is a trap or ambush, but other details are not forthcoming.

### SIX (2)

**Component:** None

This spell creates 5 illusionary duplicates of the caster who mirror his every move. In combat, any successful attack against the Sorcerer will only stand a 1 in 6 chance of hitting the real copy. However, the copies will be dispelled when hit, so if a duplicate is hit, the next attack will stand a 1 in 5 chance of hitting the caster and so on. These duplicates will not count as extra combatants for outnumbering purposes, and will not strike any opponents. If not dispelled by attacks, these duplicates will vanish after a number of combat rounds equal to the Sorcerer's Inner Strength.

### JIG (1)

**Component:** Bamboo Flute

The caster must play the flute as this spell is cast. The spell will cause one target to start dancing uncontrollably to the music, and cannot take any voluntary actions. As is usual with spells of this sort, the victim may test for LUCK to avoid the effects. If the dancing victim is attacked, they can make a combat roll as normal, but suffer a -2 penalty to their attack strength and cannot inflict any damage. The spell will last for a number of rounds equal to the Sorcerer's Inner Strength or until the Sorcerer stops playing, whichever is shorter.

### GOB (1)

**Component:** Goblin Tooth

This spell will consume a Goblin Tooth to summon a Goblin warrior (SKILL 5/STAMINA 5) to fight for the Sorcerer. The Goblin will obey any command, even suicidal ones, and will persist for a number of minutes equal to the caster's Inner Strength or until killed. The Goblin will appear with normal Goblin equipment, which will also disappear when the Goblin does.

### YOB (1)

**Component:** Giant Molar

This spell is similar to the GOB spell, except that a Giant molar is used up to summon a Cave Giant (SKILL 9 / STAMINA 10). As with GOB, this summoned creature is equipped and entirely subservient to the will of the Sorcerer. Problems may be encountered if there is limited headroom! The Giant will persist for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength.

### GUM (1)

**Component:** A Vial of Glue

When casting this spell, the caster throws a vial of glue at the feet of the target. The spell causes the glue to spread out and become super-sticky, making it very difficult for the victim to move freely. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, but if this test is failed the target must halve their SKILL (rounded up) for all physical actions including combat. The glue will last for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength. The vial of glue is consumed by the spell.

### HOW (2)

**Component:** None

This spell can be cast when there is a choice of two or more ways onwards. The caster must have a goal in mind, such as escape, safety, accessing the centre of the dungeon etc. This spell will then give the caster a psychic nudge towards one of the ways onwards. The Game Master should make an educated decision on which way is best to follow.

### DOC (1)

**Component:** A medicinal potion

This spell, when combined with the target drinking a healing potion, will result in the healing potion having double the normal effect. This spell is one of the few that will not work on the Sorcerer himself. In addition, some herbal potions may be enhanced to completely cure a poison or disease. These should be adjudicated on a case by case basis by the Game Master.

### DOZ (2)

**Component:** None

This spell will cause a victim's movements to slow and become sluggish if they fail a test for LUCK. The target makes all physical tests, including combat, at -4, and the target will also be able to inflict damage on even numbered rounds. If the Target wins an odd-numbered attack round, they will not inflict any damage. The effects will last for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength.

### DUD (2)

**Component:** None

When cast, this spell will turn stones, sticks and other debris into apparent treasure worth 1D6×10gp. The treasure is only illusionary however, and will vanish after a number of hours equal to the caster's Inner Strength. The false treasure will radiate a faint magical aura, and a successful test of awareness will give the target an indication that the treasure is not all it seems.

### MAG (2)

**Component:** None

This spell acts as a pre-emptive counterspell, protecting against the next hostile spell cast against the Sorcerer. This spell will remain active for as many combat rounds as the Sorcerer has Inner Strength, but will only stop one spell, regardless of the power of the attacking spell.

### POP (1)

**Component:** Small stone

This spell must be cast on a small stone held by the caster. This stone is charged with magical power such that it will inflict 1D3 damage if thrown at an opponent or object. A stone will retain its power for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength, and a stone can be thrown by anyone.

### FAL (2)

**Component:** None

When cast, this spell will protect the Sorcerer against one fall. This spell may be cast before or during a fall, as long as the fall is above 15m, thus giving the Sorcerer time to cast the spell. This spell will not provide the power of flight, but will merely act as a magical parachute, gently lowering the caster to the ground.

### DIM (2)

**Component:** None

When cast, this spell will cause the mind of one target within 5m to become severely confused if they fail a test for LUCK. The effects will last for one round for every two full points in Inner Strength, and each round must roll 1D6 and consult the following table to find out what action they will take:

| Roll | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| 1 | Target attacks Sorcerer |
| 2 | Target attacks own friends |
| 3 | Target attacks random opponent |
| 4 | Target dithers and does nothing |
| 5 | Target flees for one round |
| 6 | Target may choose his own actions |

### FOG (2)

**Component:** None

When cast this spell will fill one enclosed space with a dense fog, making activity for all concerned almost impossible. All caught within the room will make all physical tests at a penalty of -4 (except the caster who will only have a penalty of -1) until the fog dissipates after a number of combat rounds equal to Inner Strength.

### MUD (1)

**Component:** A handful of sand

As this spell is cast, the Sorcerer must throw a handful of sand over the area desired. This spell will turn the area of ground 3m across into a deep quicksand. Any creature stepping into the quicksand will start sinking into it. The victim must immediately test their SKILL or LUCK to avoid being caught, but if they do escape they will escape back to where they started. A captured creature will drown in a number of rounds equal to their own SKILL characteristic, during which time they will sink lower and lower. The target can fight anyone within weapon range, but will have a penalty equal to 1 for every round they have been sinking. They may be rescued with a suitable plan by anyone not stuck. The quicksand will last for a number of minutes equal to the caster's Inner Strength.

### NIF (1)

**Component:** Nose Plugs

This spell is unique in that the material component is not absolutely required to cast the spell, but without the nose plugs, the caster will suffer the full effects of the spell. When the spell takes effect, the enclosed space immediately fills with an incredibly bad smell. All within suffer a penalty of -2 or more to all actions whilst the smell persists. Most Humanoid creatures suffer a -2 penalty, unless they have the Awareness skill of 3 or more, in which case the level of Awareness is used as the penalty. The general principle is that the better the sense of smell the target has, the higher the penalty. Creatures such as wolves with a good sense of smell will have a penalty of -4. The smell will persist for a number of combat rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength.

### TEL (1)

**Component:** A cloth skullcap

This spell is almost identical to the wizardry spell ESP (rank 2). It will allow the caster to read the surface thoughts and emotions of one target within 5 metres, and will last for a number of combat rounds equal to the Sorcerer's Inner Strength.

### GAK (1)

**Component:** A black facemask

When this spell is cast and the mask held up to the caster's face, one target within sight must immediately test for LUCK. If this test is failed, the target will immediately flee the caster for a number of rounds equal to 12 minus the target's SKILL characteristic.

### SAP (2)

**Component:** None

This spell will drain all morale, confidence and energy from the target, causing them to fight with a -1 penalty to SKILL, a -1 modification to damage rolls, and a -1 penalty to armor rolls as the victim becomes very lacklustre. The target will of course receive a test for LUCK to avoid the effects and the effects will last for one round for every point the caster has in their Inner Strength.

### GOD (1)

**Component:** A jewel of gold

This spell, when cast, will cause all humanoids nearby to become more favourably disposed towards the caster. This will cause all reactions (as described in [[RULES/Character-Creation|Character Creation]]) to shift one place towards friendly; Hostile > Unfriendly > Neutral > Friendly, and will also apply a +2 bonus to all social type tests with those affected. Creatures that are tasked with being hostile to the Sorcerer, such as guards, assassins etc, are allowed a test vs LUCK, but other creatures should not. The jewel of gold is consumed by this spell.

### KIN (1)

**Component:** A gold-backed mirror

The caster must hold up a gold-backed mirror as this spell is cast. The spell then creates a double of the target, who receives a test for LUCK to prevent the spell working. If a double does appear, it will attack the original and will have the same SKILL and STAMINA as the original, and the same equipment, although none of the special abilities or spellcasting. The copy's weapons and armor will also not have any magical abilities of the originals. This spell is best used against lone enemies as any outside interference in the subsequent combat will dispel the copy. During the fight, the caster must keep the mirror pointed at the combat. The copy will persist for a number of rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength, but will disappear if either combatant is defeated.

### PEP (1)

**Component:** A potion of Firewater

This spell will greatly increase the strength of the caster, who must drink a potion of firewater during casting. The caster will gain a +3 bonus to all damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to the caster's Inner Strength. There is also a +3 bonus to the Strength skill during this time.

### ROK (1)

**Component:** Rock Dust

This spell will instantly turn to stone one target whom the caster throws a handful of rock dust over. There is of course a test for LUCK to avoid this effect. If the test is failed, the target and all he carries is turned to stone. The victim will return to normal form after 3 minutes, and will be mostly impervious to normal attacks during this time. The Game Master will need to rule on the affect of any magical attacks. The casting of this spell will consume the rock dust.

### NIP (1)

**Component:** Yellow Powder

Whilst casting this spell the Sorcerer must sniff a special yellow powder. For a number of combat rounds equal to half of his Inner Strength (rounded down), the caster may act at double the normal rate. Thus the caster may attack twice per round, may cast two spells, may run at twice normal speed or any combination of these. Thus under the effects of these spells, a Sorcerer may cast a spell and attack in the same round.

### HUF (1)

**Component:** A galehorn

When casting this spell, the Sorcerer must blow hard into a Galehorn in the direction of the target(s). As the spell takes effect, a huge blast of wind knocks over all man-sized or smaller beings within 3m of the target point. All affected beings may not take any action in the current round other than getting up, although they may also not be attacked with hand-to-hand or missile weapons due to the high winds in the area of effect.

### FIX (1)

**Component:** A staff of oak

This spell will fix one target in place, removing it from all natural laws. If the target is alive, it gets to test for LUCK to resist the spell, otherwise it is frozen and fixed in place. The target is no longer affected by gravity, time or indeed any other natural or magical force. All the while the Sorcerer concentrates and keeps the staff pointed at the target, the victim is fixed. As soon as this concentration is dropped, the target is subject again to whatever forces were acting on the target at the time they were fixed. Thus a Sorcerer fixing a wyvern diving to attack the caster would resume the same dive when the fix was removed.

### NAP (1)

**Component:** A brass pendulum

The caster must set the pendulum swinging as the spell is cast, hypnotising a creature and then sending it to sleep. There is a test for LUCK to avoid the effects, although if the target fails they will instantly fall into a natural sleep. They will only wake up when they would normally wake, although loud noises etc will also wake the target up.

### ZEN (1)

**Component:** Jewel studded medallion

This spell is somewhere between the Levitate and Fly spells in power. Once cast, the Sorcerer may float up, down or in any direction, up to a maximum of 2 metres every combat round. No other spells may be cast whilst the Sorcerer is floating, and the caster may not attack anyone, but otherwise the spell only ends when the Sorcerer touches down on a solid surface.

### YAZ (1)

**Component:** A pearl ring

This spell causes the caster and all that he carries to become invisible. The invisibility lasts for as many minutes as the caster has points in Inner Strength, although it will end early if the caster attacks anyone or casts another spell.
