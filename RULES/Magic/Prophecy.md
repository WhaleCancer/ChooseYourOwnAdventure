# Prophecy

Magic is a fundamental force in the world, similar to elements, and some heroes are attuned to it, able to "pluck whole spells from the winds of magic."

## Prophetess

A prophetess (or prophet) is a magic user who receives random powers through visions or signs, which they interpret to cast spells. They have limited control, the absence of spell books or holy symbols, and the uncertain, unreliable, and daily-changing nature of their magic (e.g., casting 'Levitate' one day, then 'Fog' the next).

## Foretelling

Prophetesses develop MAGIC Characteristic and special skill [Magic-Prophecy](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Prophecy.md), add the two together to get their 'Foretelling' score (similar to Arcane Power, Inner Strength etc).

## Second Sight

Must put one point into 'Second Sight' special skill - generally done at character creation but can be done later. A prophetess cannot learn the special skill 'MAGIC - Visions' until they have one point in the Second Sight skill.

## Daily Spells

Get a number of spells per day picked at random from the Wizard and Sorcerer spell lists (can include any other magical traditions the Director allows). The total magic point cost of their spells should be less than or equal to Twice their Foretelling score and the highest level of spell they can choose is equal to the points they have in the special skill Magic - Visions.

## Spell Tables

See [Prophecy Random Spell Table](Prophecy/Prophecy%20Random%20Spell%20Table.md) for the random spell tables used to determine daily spells.
