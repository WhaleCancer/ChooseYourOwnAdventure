# Illusionary Meal (1)

Creates a large, tasty meal for up to ten people, complete with ale, wines, and condiments. Diners feel full and comfortable. The food is illusionary and provides no STAMINA gain. However, diners also do not lose STAMINA for not eating that day. Works for up to three successive days, after which it has no effect until diners have eaten normally for one day.
