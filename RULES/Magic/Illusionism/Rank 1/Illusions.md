# Illusions (1)

Allows the Illusionist to create one defined visual illusion. The illusion has no physical presence and will be apparent to observers if a creature touches it, or if it touches a creature. Expires after ten minutes. A target will not normally have a Test for Luck to avoid the illusion, though this may be allowed in some circumstances. An example given is an illusory bridge over a chasm that will not support weight, and a Test for LUCK may be allowed to avoid falling straight through.
