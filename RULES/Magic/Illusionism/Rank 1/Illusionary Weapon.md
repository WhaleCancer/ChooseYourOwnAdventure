# Illusionary Weapon (1)

Creates an illusionary melee weapon of any kind in the caster's hand. Lasts for ten minutes and can be used to attack. Enemies susceptible to illusions believe they take damage, showing apparent wounds. The Illusionist uses their SKILL plus Magic-Illusionism to attack, and the damage track corresponds to the weapon type created. Illusionary damage knocks the target out rather than killing them. If the Illusionary Weapon is dispelled, the damage also disappears immediately.
