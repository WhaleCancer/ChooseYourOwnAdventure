# Illusion Ward (1)

**Cost:** At least 1 Magic Point, up to the Illusionist's Magic-Illusionism value

Creates a glowing sigil on a solid, immovable surface, about the size of a human hand. If an Illusion is created within 10 yards (or moves into that range) of the sigil, it is immediately dispelled if its Magic Point cost is equal to or lower than the sigil's value. Lasts for one hour per Magic Point invested.
