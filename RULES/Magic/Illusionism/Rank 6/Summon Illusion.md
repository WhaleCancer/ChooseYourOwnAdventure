# Summon Illusion (6)

This spell is a favorite of powerful Illusionists, animating magical energy with a "spark of living spirit" to create a "physical creature illusion" under the caster's control. It takes "a whole hour to cast" but requires "no actual components." The Illusionist can issue orders that will be followed literally until countermanded. The illusion serves faithfully until slain.

Different amounts of Magic Points can create various illusions: Beetle-Illusion (6), Rat Illusion (6), Eagle Illusion (7), Warrior-Illusion (7), Skeletal Illusion (8), or Spider-Illusion (8). The type of illusion can also be "rolled for on the table below."

An Illusionist can have "a maximum of one summoned illusions at any one time for every four points they have in their combined Shapeworking score."
