# Encircling Snake (6)

When cast, the Illusionist throws their hand towards a target within 30 yards. A worm-sized snake appears, growing as it flies, becoming a large (illusory) constrictor that wraps around the target. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Illusionist's "Shapeworking value." The target suffers a -2 penalty to all actions, can only walk (not run), cannot use missile weapons, and the snake counts as an enemy for outnumbering purposes. The victim can attempt to remove the snake (which has a "touch element"), but cannot actually remove it unless the spell is countered or its duration ends.
