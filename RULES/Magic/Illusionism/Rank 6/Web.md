This illusionary spell creates sticky spider webs up to 5 meters in diameter. It specifies that the illusion includes the sensation of touch, causing anyone caught to believe they are bound and immobilized. Strong victims (like Trolls or Giants) can break free in two Attack Rounds, and Heroes with the Strength Special Skill can escape after two successful Strength tests. Heroes without this skill must wait for the five-minute duration of the spell to elapse.
