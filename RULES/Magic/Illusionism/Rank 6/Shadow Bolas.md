# Shadow Bolas (6)

This spell summons a "whirling magical bolas of black threads" above the Illusionist's head, targeting an enemy within six meters. The threads attempt to strangle the victim, who gets a "Test for Luck." If "Lucky," the victim takes 1d6 STAMINA damage (no Armour Roll allowed) and breaks free. If "Unlucky," the victim dies in 1d6 Attack Rounds as the bolas tightens, "unless any allies can use enchanted objects or spells such as Counterspell."
