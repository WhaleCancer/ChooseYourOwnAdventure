# Grand Illusion (4)

This spell is a more powerful version of a basic Illusion spell, incorporating senses like smell, sound, and touch. It details that those affected will believe themselves injured, the illusion's combat capabilities (SKILL equivalent to Illusionist's MAGIC characteristic + Magic-Illusionism Special Skill), the illusory nature of wounds, and that "killed" victims merely become unconscious for an "Attack Round" before waking up healed. The spell lasts for 30 minutes.

Anyone "slain" by an Illusory Double will wake up 10 to 60 minutes later, fully healed, depending on the Illusionist's Magic-Illusionism Special Skill rank.
