# Illusory Double (4)

This spell allows the Illusionist to conjure an exact duplicate of a target creature. The description notes various ways the duplicate can appear (e.g., from a mirror, shadows, or fully formed). The duplicate possesses the same SKILL, STAMINA, and powers as the original, is controlled by the Illusionist, and can be commanded to attack the original. The Illusory Double exists for only one battle, regardless of the outcome, and then disappears.

The spell works on creatures up to the size of a Water Buffalo or Warhorse. For larger creatures, multiple "Illusory Double" spells may be required. A rule of thumb is provided: for every 5 STAMINA points (or part thereof) above 10, an additional spell is needed. An example is given: a creature with 18 STAMINA requires three spells, which can be cast as one spell costing 12 Magic Points. This assumes the Illusionist has a "rough idea of the creature's" STAMINA score.
