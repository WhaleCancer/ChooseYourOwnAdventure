# Maze of Illusion (8)

This spell traps one target (who is not allowed a Test for Luck) in an illusory maze. The maze can take various forms, including a traditional hedgerow maze, a series of identical twisty passages, or a magical collection of colored corridors leading in multiple directions.

The victim remains trapped for as many hours as the caster has points in Magic-Illusionism. Escape methods include finding the exit (potentially with the Director's help using a simple maze layout, referencing "Maze of Zagor" from "Warlock of Firetop Mountain"), or by successfully casting specific spells like Counterspell, Dispel Illusion, Find, or Where's Home. A -2 penalty is applied to these spells due to the deceptive nature of the labyrinth. Master Illusionists, such as Mordraneth, have perfected casting spells like Summon Illusion against victims while they are in the maze.

A victim trapped in the illusion cannot be harmed by anything else until they either exit the labyrinth or the spell's duration expires.
