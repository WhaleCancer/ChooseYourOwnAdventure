# Witchcraft

Witchcraft is a type of magic found in isolated or "ill-favoured" areas, where it is common. While not "evil" in nature, practitioners often use it to cause misery and upset to their enemies, which typically includes anyone they dislike.

> **Note:** Male practitioners of Witchcraft are less common and are called warlocks.

## Hex Score

Witches learn the [Magic-Witchcraft](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Witchcraft.md) special skill. As this is a Primary magical style, Witches cannot also learn Wizardry or Sorcery. The combined total of their MAGIC and Magic-Witchcraft scores is referred to as their "Hex" score.

## Witch Abilities

Most witches are skilled in mundane healing, herbs, and medicines, often making a living from these skills. They also commonly know the arts of Enchantment and Summoning, but their primary magical focus remains Witchcraft itself.

## Nature of Witchcraft

Witchcraft is an ancient art passed down from Witch to Witch, never formally taught, but utilizing the natural magical energies of Titan's wilds. Unlike Wizardry or Sorcery, it doesn't have a list of common spells but rather specific magical effects. All Witches know all three of their powers, and how they use them depends on their specific power. Witches use the Magic-Wizardry special skill to manifest their powers and require Magic Points. A Witch cannot know other common Magic special skills like Wizardry or Sorcery.

## Social Perception

While a Hero can practice Witchcraft, they should be aware that people in more civilized areas often view Witches with deep suspicion or outright hostility. An openly recognizable Witch may find it difficult to move freely in a city.

## Major Powers

The three major powers that Witches use are:
