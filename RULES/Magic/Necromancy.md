# Necromancy

Necromancy is an evil use of Magic to create undead or curse enemies. It damages the Necromancer's soul and prevents casting other Wizardry spells.

## Necromancy Spells

### Grave Stench (Minor)

**Effect:** Causes a touched object or spot to emit a foul odor of rotting and decomposing flesh.

**Impact:** Repulses most animals (except vultures, which may be attracted), makes normal people very uncomfortable.

**Conditions:** More effective indoors (no wind to disperse smell).

**Duration:** Lasts for 10 minutes.

### Minor Skeleton (Minor)

**Effect:** Animates a small animal skeleton or corpse (e.g., mouse, rat, monkey). Cannot animate anything larger than a domestic cat.

**Control:** The animated corpse is under the caster's full control as long as it's within sight.

**Duration:** Remains animated until the following dawn.

**Combat:** If used in combat, the corpse has SKILL 3, STAMINA 1, and inflicts 1 point of damage on a successful hit.

**Utility:** Can be used to move or manipulate objects the necromancer cannot otherwise reach.

### Corpse Talk (1)

**Effect:** Allows necromancers to speak to the dead.

**Casting:** Must be cast directly onto the dead body or the spot where the creature died.

**Target:** Can be cast on any formerly living creature.

**Requirement:** The necromancer must understand the language spoken by the deceased to communicate.

**Interaction:** Allows asking three questions, which must be asked promptly ("The dead do not like to be kept hanging around!").

### Spectral Blade (1)

**Effect:** Causes a ghostly blade to spring from a specially prepared bone hilt and crossguard (which is not damaged by the spell).

**Duration:** Lasts for 2 minutes per point of arcane power.

**Combat:** Uses the Swords special skill and inflicts damage as a normal sword.

**Defense:** Armor provides no protection from this blade unless it is magical.

### Spectral Dart (1)

**Effect:** Causes a small translucent dart to fly through the air and strike a living target.

**Accuracy:** No roll is required for the caster to hit the target.

**Defense:** The target may attempt to use the Dodge special skill or Test their Luck to avoid the dart.

**Damage:** If the dart hits, it inflicts 1-3 STAMINA damage.

**Protection:** Only magical armor will provide protection.

### Tomb Rot (1)

**Effect:** The target must immediately Test their Luck to avoid being infected.

**Infection Progression:** If infected, the target must Test their Luck every morning.
- **Failure:** Indicates loss of one SKILL point and two STAMINA.
- **Success:** Indicates the disease does not worsen that day.

**Recovery:** Two consecutive successful tests mean the Hero has recovered and is no longer infected.

**Death:** If SKILL or STAMINA are reduced to 0, the Hero dies.

**Nature:** This disease is non-magical and can be cured by normal means.

### Chill of the Grave (2)

**Effect:** The target is allowed a Test for Luck to avoid the effects.

**Impact:** If unlucky, the target is chilled to the bone and cannot stop shivering, even with a Heat cantrip.

**Penalty:** The target suffers a -2 penalty to combat, spellcasting, and other physical actions.

**Duration:** Lasts for a number of rounds equal to the necromancer's arcane power.

### Eyes of the Ghoul (2)

**Effect:** Functions exactly as the Darksee spell on page 76 of the AFF core rule book.

### Swarm of Bones (2)

**Requirement:** The necromancer must be holding a handful of long bones (e.g., arm bones, ribs, or leg bones).

**Casting:** The necromancer throws the bones at one target.

**Target Defense:** The target may not make a Test for Luck.

**Impact:** The bones whirl and fly around the target, distracting and preventing activity.

**Penalties:** Missile fire becomes impossible for the target. Spellcasting and melee attacks suffer a -3 penalty. Missile attacks *against* the target also suffer a -3 penalty.

**Duration:** Lasts for one round per point of Arcane power.

### Grim Beacon (4)

**Effect:** Causes a ghostly skull to appear above the target's head if a Test for Luck is failed.

**Tracking:** The skull follows the target's movements.

**Duration:** Lasts for 10 minutes per point of arcane power.

**Undead Attraction:** Calls all undead within 10 meters to come and attack the target.

**Undead Behavior:** Undead can sense the Beacon through walls and will try to make their way directly to the target.

**Countering:** A counterspell will remove the Beacon, but any undead already in sight of the target when the spell is cancelled will still attack.

### Poltergeist (4)

**Targeting:** Targets a number of enemies equal to the caster's Magic-Necromancy score.

**Defense:** Each target is allowed a Test for Luck to avoid the effects.

**Activity:** Affected targets become the focus of poltergeist activity, which includes: weapons being drawn from scabbards, arrows scattered, cloths thrown over heads, belts undone, etc.

**Effects per Round:** Each target suffers from one effect each round, determined by the Director.

**Hero Defense:** A hero may test their luck each round to avoid the effect for that round only.

**Duration:** Lasts for one round per point of arcane power. Once successfully cast cannot be cancelled by a counterspell as the poltergeist is already in the world.

### Wall of Bones (4)

**Effect:** Requires 4 leg or arm bones to create a circular wall of bones around a target. It functions as a standard wall spell (see AFF core book page 78) and inflicts 1D6 damage to any living being touching it.

### Call of the Underworld (6)

**Effect:** Functions exactly as the "Banish Undead" spell (see page 78 of the AFF core rule book).

### Ghost Fence (6)

**Casting Time:** Takes considerable time to cast, involving placing wooden poles topped with skulls. Each post must be within sight of its neighbors, all posts must be placed while the enchantment is underway, with a maximum of 12 posts.

**Activation:** Once active, any living being crossing the fence line activates the magic, causing the skull eye sockets to glow red. Intruders take 1D6 STAMINA damage, and the necromancer is aware of the crossing.

**Defense:** If a living being grabs or strikes an active pole (even with a missile weapon or ranged spell), they take 3D6 STAMINA damage as dead spirits bound within the fence stream towards the attacker. A counterspell can cancel the fence.

**Duration:** If not cancelled, the fence lasts one day per point of arcane power.

### Raise Undead (6)

**Effect:** Functions exactly as the "Raise Skeleton" spell (see page 79 of the AFF core rule book), but a true necromancer can raise 8 undead per point of arcane power.

### Spirit of the Assassin (8)

**Effect:** Functions exactly as the "Assassins Dagger" spell (see page 80 of the AFF core rule book).

### Eye of Death (8)

**Effect:** Functions exactly as the "Death" spell (see page 80 of the AFF core rule book).

### Transcend Death (8)

**Effect:** A necromancer implants a portion of their life force into an object, losing 1 SKILL and 2 STAMINA points. The object radiates a faint enchantment.

**Resurrection:** If the necromancer is killed within the next month and a day, their life force is tethered to the mortal plane by the object and returns to their body when safe, though the invested SKILL and STAMINA points are lost.

**Death Wraith:** If the necromancer's earthly body is totally destroyed, the necromancer becomes a Death Wraith. If the necromancer does not die in the allotted time, the SKILL and STAMINA points are recovered and the spell ends.
