# Primal Magic

Primal Magic is incredibly rare on Titan, developed by Atlantean God-Kings of old. It draws power from ancient energies, is difficult to learn, hard to use and incredibly powerful. Characters can only learn it from specific teachers or grimoires, with the latter requiring the input of an archmage or similar. Learning the [Magic-Primal Magic](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Primal-Magic.md) special skill and increasing its rank costs double the normal amount of xp, as does learning Primal spells.

## Arcane Mastery

The special skill functions similarly to Magic-Wizardry (a Secondary style). Casting requires a test against MAGIC (and the special skill). Only spells of a level equal to or less than the special skill can be learned. Primal spells use the same MAGIC POINTS as Wizardry spells but cost double their level. The combined total of MAGIC and Magic-Primal is called "Arcane Mastery." Few individuals practice this magic, and ancient Atlantean tomes must be located to find new spells to learn.

## Primal Magic Spells

Some Primal spells last until the following dawn. Only one Primal spell can be active on a single target at a time; casting a second one on the same target will end the original spell's effect, but the new spell will be active.

The numbers listed for each spell in brackets after the name refer to both the rank of the spell and the base magic point cost for the spell.
