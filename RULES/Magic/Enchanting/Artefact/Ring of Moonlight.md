The Ring of Moonlight is a dark grey ring with a high lustre, inlaid with a white and red design. The ring has no power during the day, but if the ring is worn after the moon has risen it grants great power to the wearer. The wearer may see clearly in the dark and also receives a bonus of +4 to all awareness and stealth tests. If the wearer is in the open air, he may call down a beam of moonlight to strike an opponent inflicting 2D6 damage to a living enemy and 3D6 against Demons and undead. This moonbeam may be called down four times every night at full moon and twice per night at other times. In addition, the wearer receives a bonus of +1 to armour rolls and +2 to damage rolls against undead and demons at night. Once per night the wearer may also glow with an inner moonlight and heal himself of 2D6 STAMINA damage.
