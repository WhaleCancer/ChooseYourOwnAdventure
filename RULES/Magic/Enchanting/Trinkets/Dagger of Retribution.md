A somewhat common Trinket, the Dagger of retribution is coveted by all spellcasters who dislike being surrounded by hostile enemies intent on doing them harm! The dagger can of course be used in the normal way, and is indeed a decent weapon, but it also has a power that can swing the battle when the mage is surrounded. If the dagger is held aloft and the control word shouted out, a wave of power will extend outwards from the mage to a distance of 10 yards. Every creature within this area, whether live, undead or demon, will take 1d6 STAMINA damage as tendrils of force lash out (no armour or dodge roll allowed) and will be knocked down, if they are up to the size of an ogre. Once this power has been used once, the dagger becomes non-magical.
