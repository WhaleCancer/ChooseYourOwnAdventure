# Prophecy Random Spell Table

This is an example of the spell table you could use for a prophetess hero, this can be altered to suit both the hero and the Director - the prophetess shouldn't have full control over what goes into the table but they may request a few spells that are appropriate for their hero.

## Example

Zelmipa the Prophetess has increased her MAGIC characteristic to 8 and now has 4 points in the special skill MAGIC - Visions which gives her a total of 8 + 4 = 24 Foretelling. At the start of the day she chooses to roll twice on the 4 magic point table (the highest she can roll on with 4 points in the MAGIC - Visions skill), four times on the 2 magic point table and eight times on the 1 magic point table for a total of 24 (equal to twice her Foretelling score).
