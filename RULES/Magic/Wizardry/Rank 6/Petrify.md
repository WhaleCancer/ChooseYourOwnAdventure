# Petrify (6)

This powerful spell will start turning one target, who must be within 5 metres, to stone. Starting with the feet, and creeping slowly upwards, the target will lose 1 STAMINA and 1 SKILL every two combat rounds until his current STAMINA score reaches 0 (SKILL will stop declining at 0). When this has happened, the target, his clothes and equipment included, will be completely made of stone. The process can be reversed if a counterspell is cast or the caster is killed before the process is completed. If the victim is fully petrified, he can never be turned back.
