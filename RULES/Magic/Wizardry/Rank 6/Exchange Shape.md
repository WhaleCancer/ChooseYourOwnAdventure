# Exchange Shape (6)

This spell requires the Wizard to touch the victim whilst the spell is cast; If the target fails his test for LUCK, the Wizard and target exchange bodies! The caster will retain his own characteristics, but will of course be free of most curses, poisons and diseases that the old body suffered from. This spell is permanent, although a successful counterspell will reverse it, forcing the original caster back into his own body, wherever that might be. If the caster's original body has died, the counterspell will effectively kill him. The caster will however acquire any special abilities the new body possesses. Thus a caster Exchanging Shape with a Birdman will be able to fly, even if a bit of practice is required first.
