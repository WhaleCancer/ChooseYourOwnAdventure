# Cockroach (6)

This particularly nasty spell has featured in many legends and folk tales, where it has turned Characters into frogs, cockroaches or mice. Thus if the target fails their test for LUCK, they permanently become a small and inoffensive creature of the caster's choice. Their clothes and other possessions are not affected, and so drop to the ground where their owner once stood. The poor victim still retains their knowledge and consciousness but can only speak in an animal language. The caster may reverse this spell by touching the target and willing it so, otherwise only a counterspell can reverse the transformation.
