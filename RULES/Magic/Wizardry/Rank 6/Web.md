This spell will fill an area up to 5 metres in diameter with strong, sticky spider webs. Anyone within the area will be bound by multiple strands and completely immobilised. A very strong victim such as a Troll or Giant can break out in two rounds, and any Character with the Strength skill can break out after two successful Strength tests. Characters without the Strength skill must wait for the 5 minute duration to elapse before they are freed.
