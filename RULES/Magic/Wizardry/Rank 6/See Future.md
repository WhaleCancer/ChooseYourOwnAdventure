# See Future (6)

This spell allows the caster to see brief scenes from the near future of either himself or one known person. The future in this case is no more than 2 days, and the visions are often confusing and obscure. The visions are of events that will probably happen, but intervening events may change this. This spell often presents problems for the Game Master, as he will be required to predict what will happen…..
