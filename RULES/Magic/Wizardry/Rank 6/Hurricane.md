# Hurricane (6)

This specialised version of the Weather Control spell conjures up a 30 metre radius storm around the caster, with ferocious winds, hail, rain and even snow. Everyone caught in the area of effect (except the caster) must test either their LUCK or SKILL or be blown right off their feet, suffering 1D3 points of STAMINA damage in the process. Attempting to stand or move away requires another test. Combat, spellcasting and conversation are almost impossible within the area of effect, with the Hurricane lasting 5 minutes. The caster himself must concentrate throughout the duration and may take no other actions. It is also possible that other objects or even buildings within the area may be damaged by the spell.
