# Teleport (6)

This spell is a very powerful addition to the repertoire of any Wizard. This spell will allow the caster to travel instantly between two places that are less than 10km apart! The caster must have some idea of where he will appear, although a very good description would suffice from someone who knows the place well. The spell will transport the caster and whatever he can carry in his hands (including up to one other person) to the target location. Assuming the spell works correctly, the caster appears immediately.
