# Protective Circle (6)

This spell is learned by Wizards encountering demons and undead. When cast, it creates a 1-yard radius glowing circle on the ground around the Wizard (and only the Wizard). Any Demon or Undead attempting to cross or attack the Wizard within the circle suffers a -2 penalty, an additional -2 on Damage rolls, and takes 1d6 STAMINA damage (no armor protection). The circle lasts as long as the Wizard concentrates, which penalizes further spellcasting by the Wizard by -2.
