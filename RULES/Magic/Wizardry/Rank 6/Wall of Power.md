# Wall of Power (6)

This spell is a more powerful version of the Wall spell, and creates a similar barrier around the caster, although this one is dome-shaped, and can be increased in size by spending an additional 3 magic points for every extra 5 metres diameter. This wall will not only keep enemies out, but will actively damage any who try to pass through. Any being touching the outside of the wall will take 3D6 points of damage (armor will protect against this damage), and although they will not be able to pass through the wall, will continue to take damage on each round they are in contact with it. Lasting five minutes, this spell can only be removed with a counterspell, or another wall of power (which destroys both walls).
