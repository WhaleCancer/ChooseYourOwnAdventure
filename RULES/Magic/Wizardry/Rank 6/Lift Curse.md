# Lift Curse (6)

This spell allows a powerful Wizard to remove a curse from a single target. The Wizard must make a spellcasting roll with a penalty equal to the curser's Magic-Witchcraft skill. Extra preparation time does not grant a bonus, and Magic Points are expended even if the curse isn't lifted. If successful, the curse is permanently removed. If it fails only due to the penalty, the curse is removed until the next dawn, then reappears, requiring re-casting for permanent removal.
