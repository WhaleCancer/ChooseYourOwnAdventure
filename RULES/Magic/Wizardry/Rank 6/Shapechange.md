# Shapechange (6)

This spell lasts for an hour, allowing the caster to freely change their shape to anything between a mouse and a rhinoceros. They gain the natural abilities of the new shape (flight, water breathing, weapons, armor) but retain their own STAMINA. The SKILL of the new shape is determined by their MAGIC characteristic. Changing shape takes a full round and doesn't require a spellcasting roll. Anything carried by the Wizard also changes shape, and they can only speak and cast if the new shape allows speech.
