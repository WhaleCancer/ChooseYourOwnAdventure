# Earthquake (8)

This spell will cause a massive earthquake in the local area, affecting a radius of 50 metres. The earthquake will last for 1 minute, and will cause massive damage to buildings and structures. Any Characters caught in the area will need to test their SKILL or LUCK every round to avoid falling over, and will take 1D6 points of damage if they do fall. The Game Master will need to adjudicate the effects on buildings and other structures.
