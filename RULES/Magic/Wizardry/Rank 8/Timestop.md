# Timestop (8)

This very powerful spell allows the Wizard to manipulate Time itself, stopping it for everyone except the caster. The Director rolls 1d3+1 (without revealing the result to the player) to determine the number of rounds during which only the Wizard (or Demigods or similar) can act. The Wizard can move, drink a potion, cast a spell, etc., but cannot move or attack anything around them. The rest of the world is effectively frozen. Potions drunk or spells cast have no immediate effect; the spell itself hangs in the air at the casting point like a small glowing ball. As soon as the spell ends, time resumes, and any spells cast during the stopped time immediately take effect. This spell is very draining and cannot be cast more than once a day.
