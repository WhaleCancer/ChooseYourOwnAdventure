# Restore Fortune (8)

This incredibly rare spell is seldom cast. When cast, the Wizard's initial LUCK value is permanently reduced by 1. However, all allies of the Wizard within 100 yards (including the Wizard themself) restore their current LUCK to their initial value. This spell allows a Wizard and allies to overcome incredible odds, but at great personal cost.
