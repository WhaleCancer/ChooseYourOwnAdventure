# Ignite (1)

When cast, this spell will cause something flammable to burst into flame (equivalent to a small fire), which is thereafter treated as a normal fire. The target must normally be touched, although the expenditure of an additional magic point will allow a range of 5m, with each additional magic point adding another 5m. This spell will not ignite a living creature unless they are especially flammable.
