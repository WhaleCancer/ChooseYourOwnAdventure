# Delay Spell (+1)

This spell is cast at the same time as another Wizardry spell of any power, but individual spellcasting rolls must be made. The effect of this spell is to delay the co-cast spell from taking effect for between 1 and 6 rounds. The other spell has normal effect, and will affect the same target as originally specified, just at a later time. Anyone able to detect magic will be able to detect the Delay spell itself.
