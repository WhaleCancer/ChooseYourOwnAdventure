# Flash! (1)

This spell will cause a brief but very bright flash of light to emanate from just in front of the caster. Anyone within sight will be blinded for 1D6 minutes (rolled separately for each target) unless they state that they will be closing their eyes or successfully test for LUCK. The caster may also choose to close his eyes. Anyone who does state they are closing their eyes will suffer a penalty of -4 to all actions for that combat round. The only exception to this is that the caster will not have a penalty to casting this spell. If cast in an area of magical darkness, the gloom will be dispersed for one round only before returning.
