# Silence (1)

This spell creates a zone of silence that has a radius of 5 yards. The zone cannot move, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the casters Arcane Power. During that time, no sounds can be created within the zone, nor enter from outside. Spells may not be cast within the zone whilst it is active, although they can still affect those inside. Priestly powers are unaffected.
