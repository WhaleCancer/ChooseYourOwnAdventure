# Fire Bolt (1)

This common spell will hurl a small bolt of intense fire at one target within 100m from the pointed finger of the caster. The target may either test for LUCK or instead attempt a Dodge test to avoid being hit by the bolt. A target that is hit will lose 1D6 STAMINA in fire damage, and if especially flammable, may be ignited.
