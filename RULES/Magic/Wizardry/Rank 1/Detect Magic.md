# Detect Magic (1)

When cast, any active magical effect or magical item will glow gently (and be visible by all) for one round. This will include spells of all schools, potions and other magical items. The nature or power of the enchantment will not be revealed, and a minor magic cantrip will glow just as brightly as an artefact.
