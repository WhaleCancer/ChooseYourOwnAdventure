# Illusion (1)

This spell will allow the caster to create one defined visual illusion. However, the illusion has no physical presence, and so will be dispelled if a creature touches it, or indeed it touches a creature, or after three minutes. A target will not normally have a test for LUCK to avoid the illusion, although in some circumstances this may be allowed. As an example, an illusionary bridge over a chasm will vanish as soon as a character steps onto it. There would be no test for LUCK to avoid the illusion itself, although there could be a test for LUCK to avoid falling into the chasm when the "bridge" is stepped on.
