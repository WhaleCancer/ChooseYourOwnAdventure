# Lock (1)

This spell will magically lock a chest or door without needing a physical key or lock. An open spell will cancel the effect, as can the caster just by willing it, but otherwise the door or chest must be physically broken to open it. This spell will not imbue the door or chest with any extra physical integrity.
