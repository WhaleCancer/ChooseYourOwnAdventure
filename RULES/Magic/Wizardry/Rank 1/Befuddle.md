# Befuddle (1)

This spell will cause one touched target, who may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, to become very confused for one minute. The target will struggle to make active decisions, and all active tests such as combat, spellcasting, lock picking, social tests etc will be made with a penalty of -6. The target will however try and avoid danger wherever possible and retreat to a safe place where they will just stand with a glazed look.
