# Peace (1)

This spell will cause any two people within 5m to be calmed down, with a test for LUCK allowed to resist the spell. This will only happen if the targets are not actively fighting, and will also not prevent calmed targets from assisting friends who are being attacked. The expenditure of additional magic points will allow 2 more targets to be affected for each additional magic point spent. This spell will last for 2D6 minutes (rolled in secret) and will be a fragile peace, which will be broken if an unaffected person attacks a calmed target.
