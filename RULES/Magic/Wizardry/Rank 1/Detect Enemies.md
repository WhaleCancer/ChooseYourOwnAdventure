# Detect Enemies (1)

This straightforward spell will reveal the rough location of any creature (natural or supernatural) within 10 yards that intends to harm the caster. It does not dispel invisibility, remove the effects of stealth or tell the Wizard what these enemies are or what they are doing. An assassin behind a wall will be detected as "An Enemy" along with their rough location (to within a yard or so) but nothing more. This spell lasts for 10 minutes.
