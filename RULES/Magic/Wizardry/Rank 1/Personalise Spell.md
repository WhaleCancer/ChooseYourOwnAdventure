# Personalise Spell (+1)

This rank 1 spell is very popular among the flashier Wizards as it allows a spell to manifest in a particular way. Thus a Fear spell may appear as dark shadows that swirl round the target inducing terror, and a Restrain spell may appear as golden chains wrapped around the victim. Despite being a rank 1 spell, there may be an additional +1 to +6 magic point cost depending on the extent of the Personalisation. This additional cost is decided by the Game Master based upon the specification of the player. The Personalise spell is not cast separately, and so there will only be one spellcasting test.
