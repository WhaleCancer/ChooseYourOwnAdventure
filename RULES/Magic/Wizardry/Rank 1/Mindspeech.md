# Mindspeech (1)

This spell allows the Wizard to connect their mind with up to one willing target per point in the Wizardry special skill. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to their Arcane Power and will allow those connected to freely speak using only their minds. Anything that could be communicated with voice can be communicated with this spell, and the link remains even if a target moves out of sight of the Wizard.
