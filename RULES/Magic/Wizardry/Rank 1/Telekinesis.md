# Telekinesis (1)

This spell allows a Wizard to lift, manipulate, and throw items within 60 yards using only their mind. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to Arcane Power, which also serves as a SKILL for finer manipulation (e.g., disarming a Trap). Only items the Wizard can see and that fit an Encumbrance slot can be manipulated.
