# Thunder (1)

In some ways similar to the Flash! spell, this spell will create a momentary special effect; In this case a deafening clap of thunder. This massive boom can be heard up to a kilometre away, and will deafen anyone within 20m who does not test for LUCK. The caster will not be affected. Affected targets will be mostly deaf for 1D6 minutes and will struggle with communication during this time.

If the caster also knows the Flash! Spell, these may be combined into one spell (requiring one combat round to cast and one spellcasting test but costing 2 magic points) for a potent burst of sound and light.
