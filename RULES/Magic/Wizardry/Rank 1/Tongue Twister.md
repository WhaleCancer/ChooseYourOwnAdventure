# Tongue Twister (1)

When cast, this spell causes the target's tongue to be temporarily tangled and unable to speak for a whole minute. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects of the spell, but if failed will of course prevent spellcasting. The range for the spell is 5m, although each additional magic point expended will increase this range by 5m.
