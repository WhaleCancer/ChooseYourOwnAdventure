# Darkness (1)

When cast, this spell will create a 5m radius circle of absolute darkness around the caster. The area of darkness will not move, and will cancel out both normal light and the Dark Seeing talent. The darkness can be cancelled with a Light spell or a counterspell, but will otherwise last for 3 minutes.
