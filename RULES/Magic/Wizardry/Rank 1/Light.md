# Light (1)

When cast upon one inanimate object such as a staff, sword or shield, this spell will create an area of magical light (about the size of a human fist) that glows steadily with the same intensity as a torch. This light lasts for 15 minutes, but may be cancelled at will by the caster. This light will be blacked out by a Darkness spell, but will in turn cancel out an existing Darkness spell.
