# Glowing Eyes (1)

This popular spell will cause the caster's eyes (or one touched target) to glow with a colour chosen by the caster for up to five minutes, although this may be cancelled at will by the caster. The glow is equivalent to a Glimmer minor magic spell, but may also give a bonus to intimidation effects and may impress primitive folks.
