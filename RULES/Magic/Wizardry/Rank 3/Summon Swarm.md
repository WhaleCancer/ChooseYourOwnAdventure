# Summon Swarm (3)

This spell summons a swarm of small biting, scratching animals or insects (like rats or wasps) controlled by the caster. The swarm fights on the caster's behalf and does not attack her. It is 1 foot in diameter per point of Arcane Power, moves 30 feet each round, and deals 1 point of damage per round to anyone inside it (no Dodge, only natural armour rolls allowed). Victims also suffer a -3 penalty to skill tests while enveloped.
