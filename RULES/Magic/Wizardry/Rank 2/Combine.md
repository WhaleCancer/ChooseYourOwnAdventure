# Combine (+2)

This useful spell allows two other spells to be combined together. These spells together will all take only a single round to cast, but an individual spellcasting test must be made for each spell and magic points must be spent for all of the spells, both those that are combined and the Combine spell itself. If any of the individual spellcasting tests fail, all of the spells will fail. Equally, if more than one spellcasting tests results in a double 6, a separate Oops roll must be made for each double 6.
