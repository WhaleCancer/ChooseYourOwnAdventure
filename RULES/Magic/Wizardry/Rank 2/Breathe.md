# Breathe (2)

When cast, this spell will allow either the caster or one touched target to breathe for 15 minutes regardless of the quality or indeed lack of air. Thus the recipient of this spell could breathe underwater, in a smoke filled room or even in a vacuum. The caster can still breathe normally in a standard environment.
