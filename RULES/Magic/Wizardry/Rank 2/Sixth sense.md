# Sixth sense (2)

The target gains an innate sense of danger, making them immune to surprise, ambushes, or similar effects. They don't specifically detect an assassin but rather feel their neck hairs stand on edge when in danger from an attacker, trap, or natural events like a landslide. The spell lasts for one hour.
