# Endurance (2)

This spell grants the target greater than normal endurance for one hour, with two main effects:

Firstly, the target does not lose any STAMINA from hard marches, excessively hot or cold weather, or similar conditions.

Secondly, if the target takes a blow inflicting 3 or more points of STAMINA damage (after armor or dodge), the spell reduces that damage by 1 point. An example is provided: if a target takes six points of damage, two of which are stopped by armor, the remaining four points of damage are further reduced by the spell to three.
