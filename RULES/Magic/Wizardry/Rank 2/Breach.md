# Breach (2)

This spell applies raw force to an inanimate object such as a wall, gate or door. It has a range of 5m, and will reduce one cubic metre to rubble or splinters. Additional cubic metres may be added to the effect at a cost of 2 additional magic points per cubic metre. The debris produced may still partially block the breach and will need to be manually cleared.
