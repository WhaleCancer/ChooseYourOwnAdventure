# Trigger spell (+2)

This spell is cast simultaneously with another spell and requires two successful spellcasting rolls. If both succeed, the second spell only takes effect after a specific trigger occurs at that location. Examples of triggers include a door opening, an Orc walking down a corridor, or "Clarence the Merchant utters the phrase 'Libra preserve us'". If the trigger event doesn't happen within one day, both spells fade.
