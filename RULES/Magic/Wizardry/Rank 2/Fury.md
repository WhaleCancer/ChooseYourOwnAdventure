# Fury (2)

When cast on a target within 30 yards, this spell incites intense, targeted anger, which can be resisted. The affected target loses reason and violently attacks the person specified by the Wizard. This "hated person" cannot be an ally of the spell target but can be a neutral bystander. For example, a Wizard could make a Guild Enforcer attack a Dwarf companion or a mercenary, but not a fellow enforcer. The spell lasts for 1d6 rounds, and the target chooses their attack form (e.g., a spellcaster casts spells, an archer fires a bow).
