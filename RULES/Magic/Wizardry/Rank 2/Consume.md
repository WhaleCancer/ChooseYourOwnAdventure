# Consume (2)

This spell makes use of the awesome power of fire, and will envelop one target in flame equivalent to a large fire. The target must be within 5m, and if a living being may test for LUCK to avoid the effects. If the test is failed or the spell cast on an inanimate object, the target will be ignited by the spell (as long as the target is flammable of course). The large fire will then burn normally as described in [Combat](../../../Combat/Combat.md).
