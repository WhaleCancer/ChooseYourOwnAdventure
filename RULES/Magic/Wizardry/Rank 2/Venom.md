# Venom (2)

This spell coats a touched weapon with a potent poison for a number of rounds equal to the Wizard's Arcane Power. If the weapon deals at least one STAMINA point of damage to an enemy, the enemy must immediately make a SKILL or LUCK test. If successful, the target avoids the poison's effects. If the test fails, the target takes an additional 1d3 STAMINA damage and loses 1 point of SKILL for one hour.
