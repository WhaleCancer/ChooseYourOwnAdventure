# Counterspell (2)

When cast, this spell will cancel one other spell either in effect or in the process of being cast. Although the technical rank of the counterspell is 2, the magic point cost is actually equal to the rank of the spell being cancelled plus 1. Minor magic spells count as rank 0 spells for the purposes of Counterspell. A Wizard may however only counter spells that have a rank less than his own MENTAL Characteristic.

When actually making the spellcasting test, the Counterspell caster must apply a special negative modifier equal to the rank of the spell being cancelled. If this spell is cast successfully, the target spell is snuffed out before it can take effect (if being cast) or immediately cancels the target spell (if already in effect).

It is suggested that a Wizard be able to change his declared action to counter a spell being cast, although this would of course mean abandoning his already declared action.
