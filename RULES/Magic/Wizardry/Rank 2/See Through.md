# See Through (2)

This spell allows the caster to see through a solid object and see what is beyond. The basic spell will allow the caster to see through an object up to 1 metre thick. If the object is more than 1 metre thick, the caster may add in additional magic points, extending the "view" by 1 metre each time. The spell will last for 1 minute once the final magic point has been used. This spell will however only affect one object.
