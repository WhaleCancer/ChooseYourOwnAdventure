# Starry Orb (2)

This spell will create a wondrous ball of glowing light and weaving fire, suspended in the air up to 10m away from the caster. This orb will distract and transfix all who see it close at hand (within 3m). Creatures who have average intelligence or less will be hypnotised on a roll of 1-4 on 1D6. A creature with high intelligence (including Characters) may test for LUCK or test against SKILL to avoid being transfixed. Any hypnotised victims simply stare agape at the orb for the 1 minute duration of the spell. The orb cannot be moved from its original location.
