# ESP (2)

This spell, which has a range of 10m, allows the caster to look into the mind of one other living creature. The target may receive a test for LUCK to block the spell, but if failed the caster can see the emotions and general thoughts of the target. Individual thoughts or ideas cannot be read, but the caster would be able to tell if the target was angry, was friendly towards the caster or was about to attack. The spell lasts for 1 minute, but the caster must concentrate for that time for the spell to continue working.
