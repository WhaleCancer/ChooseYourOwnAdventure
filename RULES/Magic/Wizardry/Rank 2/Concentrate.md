# Concentrate (+2)

If this spell is cast on the round before any other spell, the second spell will be re-cast immediately its duration expires without requiring a new spellcasting test or indeed any time. Magic points will be expended again at the time of recasting, and the recast spell will be recast in exactly the same form as the original casting.
