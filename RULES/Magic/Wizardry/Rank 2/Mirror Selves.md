# Mirror Selves (2)

When cast, this illusion will create two copies of the caster, all of which will act in a similar way. In a fight, this spell will mean that only 1 in 3 successful attacks will actually hit the real caster, and the caster will also count as three people for the purposes of outnumbering and any bonuses thereof (although the copies will not cause any damage). Even if a copy is the one hit, it will not disappear, with the spell lasting for 3 minutes.
