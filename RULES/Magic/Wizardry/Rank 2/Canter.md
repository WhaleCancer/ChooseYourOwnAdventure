# Canter (2)

This spell increases the speed of any mount, granting a +3 bonus to Running skill tests or opposed tests in a chase. It also imbues the mount with great stamina, allowing it to carry twice the normal distance without rest over a day. If the user charges into combat mounted with a lance, spear, or other pointed weapon while the mount is under this spell's effects, they gain an additional +1 damage on their combat and damage rolls.
