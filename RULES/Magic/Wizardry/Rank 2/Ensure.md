# Ensure (2)

Nominally a rank 2 spell, this casting will prevent a catastrophic magical failure. This spell is cast at the same time as any other spell, and costs the same number of magic points as the spell it is Ensuring. Only one spellcasting test is made, but if a double 6 is rolled, the caster need not roll on the Oops table. Although costly, this spell may well prevent catastrophe visiting the caster.
