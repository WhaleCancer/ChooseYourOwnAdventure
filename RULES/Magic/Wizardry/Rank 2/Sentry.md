# Sentry (2)

Ideal when camping or resting, this spell will post a magical guard up to 20m from the caster. This invisible presence will sound the alarm should anyone unwanted approach the camp. The classification of unwanted is based upon the caster's own viewpoint. This sentry will cover a 90° arc and so in the open four sentries would be required to alert the caster. The alert can be an audible sound (emanating from the location of the sentry itself) or a mental alert to the caster. The sentries can detect hidden and invisible enemies.

This spell could also be placed upon the mouth of a pouch, lid of a chest etc. The spell will last for 24 hours or until the caster moves more than 20m from the location of the sentry.
