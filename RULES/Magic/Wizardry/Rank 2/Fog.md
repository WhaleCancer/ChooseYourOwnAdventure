# Fog (2)

This spell is in some ways similar to the Darkness spell, but it covers a larger area of 15m radius and lasts for 15 minutes. The affected area is filled with very thick grey fog with a visibility of less than a metre. All physical activity will be at a penalty of -6 and ranged attacks will be impossible. Dark Seeing will not help in this magical fog.
