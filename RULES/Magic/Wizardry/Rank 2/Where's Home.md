# Where's Home (2)

This spell will prevent a Wizard being lost in the wilderness. When cast, the caster will instantly be aware of the direction that one named place lies in. This could indeed be the caster's home, but could also be one other place known to the caster either from a visit or from an accurate map. This awareness of the direction does not imply the safest or even a passable route, and only lasts for a few seconds.
