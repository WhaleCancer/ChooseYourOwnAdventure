# Levitate (2)

This spell removes the effects of gravity from the caster, one other being, or one inanimate object. If the target is unwilling, he will receive a test for LUCK to resist the effects. When active, the target can float up or down at will (at walking pace), under the control of the caster. The levitated being may pull themselves sideways if there are handholds nearby, and may also be affected by strong winds. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and when it ends the target will float gently back down to the ground.
