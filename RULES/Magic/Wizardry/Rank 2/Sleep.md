# Sleep (2)

This spell will put one victim to sleep for 5 minutes. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, but if affected, the sleep is normal. The victim may be woken by loud noises, wounds, shaking etc. A Character may automatically kill most sleeping opponents, although this is considered bad form in most cases!
