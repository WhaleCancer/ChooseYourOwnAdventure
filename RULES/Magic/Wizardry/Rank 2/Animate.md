# Animate (2)

An incredibly useful spell much used by southern mystics to create impressive rope tricks, this spell will animate either one small item or very small item within 5m of the caster. The animated objects may not actually fly, but may "hop", slither or leap through the air and will be much stronger than their size would suggest. A flexible object may articulate itself so that a rope could tie a knot in itself or a cloak could wrap itself around a person or object. The animated object may be used to fight with an Attack Strength equal to the caster's MENTAL Characteristic plus Wizardry Skill. If however the item loses a combat round and is thus struck, the spell ends and the item loses all animation.

The spell will otherwise last for two minutes, although this may be extended by one minute for each additional magic point extended. A medium sized object may be animated with the expenditure of 2 additional magic points, a large object for an additional 4 and a very large object for 6 additional magic points.
