# Magic Bridge (4)

When cast, this spell will create a magical bridge across a chasm, river or other impassable area. Requiring a solid footing at either end, the bridge will span 5 metres for every 4 magic points put into it. The bridge is wide enough for one person, and will support as many people as it took magic points to cast. The bridge will last for 5 minutes, but will start to fade gently after 4 minutes.
