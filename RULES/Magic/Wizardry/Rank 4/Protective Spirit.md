# Protective Spirit (4)

This spell summons a small, active, magical spirit of indeterminate form that glows with a pale blue light. The spirit hovers and darts around the Wizard. As long as the Wizard refrains from physical attacks, they gain a +4 bonus to their combat Total against hand-to-hand attacks, but the spirit inflicts no damage if they win the combat round.
