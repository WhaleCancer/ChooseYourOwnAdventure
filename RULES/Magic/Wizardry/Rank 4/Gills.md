# Gills (4)

This spell affects either the caster or one target, who must be touched. An unwilling target may test for LUCK as usual to avoid the spell. This spell creates a magical pair of gills on the neck of the target, allowing them to breathe underwater. However, these gills do bypass the normal breathing arrangements and so if the target is not underwater, the target may well suffocate. This spell is permanent until cancelled by the caster or by a Counter Spell by another Wizard.
