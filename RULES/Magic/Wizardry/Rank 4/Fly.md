# Fly (4)

This spell is a more powerful version of the Levitate spell, and allows the caster or target to fly in any direction at running pace. The target has full control over their movements. The spell lasts 5 minutes and like Levitate, the flying creature will gently float to the ground when the spell expires. The caster can carry a weight equivalent to that he could carry comfortably on foot.
