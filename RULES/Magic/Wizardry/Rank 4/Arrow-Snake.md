# Arrow-Snake (4)

This nasty spell causes one arrow notched on a bow and ready for firing to instantly turn into a venomous snake! The snake will land one automatic bite on the victim (use small bite matrix) with an additional 2 points of damage for the venom. The snake will then continue to attack the target (SKILL 7 and STAMINA 3). The range of this spell is 10m, and the target does not get a test for LUCK as they spell does not affect them directly.
