# Coordination (4)

This rare but effective spell is cast on allies within 50 yards, lasting 10 rounds. All affected allies (including the Wizard) receive a +2 bonus if they are engaged in the same activity as at least one other affected ally. An example illustrates this: two party members disarming a trap each get +2, three attacking a Troll each get +2 to combat rolls, but a single Hero shooting a shaman gets no bonus. The Director determines coordination.
