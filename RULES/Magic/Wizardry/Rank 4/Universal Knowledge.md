# Universal Knowledge (4)

This spell grants the Wizard one specific Special Skill (at 2 points) for one hour. It does not add to existing ability; a Wizard with 1 point in the skill will have 2 points, not 3. The spell has no effect if the Wizard already possesses the Special Skill at 2 or greater.
