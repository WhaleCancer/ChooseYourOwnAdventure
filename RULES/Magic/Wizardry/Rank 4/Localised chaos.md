# Localised chaos (4)

This spell creates a 20-yard radius of chaos, causing random sounds, flashing lights, areas of darkness, strong winds, thrown objects, pushed beings, and wild temperature fluctuations. Actions within this area incur a 1d6 penalty, and leaving requires a successful SKILL test. A Fumble during any roll (including an attempt to leave) results in 1d3 STAMINA damage that armor does not protect.
