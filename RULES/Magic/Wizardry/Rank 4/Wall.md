# Wall (4)

This spell creates a circular wall, 5m in diameter, around the caster or one nominated object. The wall lasts 5 minutes, and is completely impervious to all attacks, objects and even spells. Only a Counter Spell can cancel the wall, although if anything or anyone inside touches the wall, it will disappear immediately. The wall will remain stationary for the duration.
