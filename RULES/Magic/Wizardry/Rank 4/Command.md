# Command (4)

This powerful spell will allow the caster to issue a single command to another being. The target may of course test for LUCK to avoid the spell, but if failed, must obey the command. This single command cannot be something that would directly and obviously be harmful. Thus a Goblin could be commanded to close its eyes in combat or drop its weapons, but could not be commanded to stab itself or throw itself off a cliff. It is important to note that the caster does not need to speak the language of the target. The effects of the command cannot last longer than 30 seconds, and the Game Master has the final say on what does and does not constitute a valid Command.
