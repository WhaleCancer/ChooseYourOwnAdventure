# Weather Control (4)

This spell utilises multiple elemental controls to control the local weather as desired by the caster. It will only affect the weather directly overhead. This spell can affect an area the size of a small village or field. Unusual weather such as heavy rain, a small whirlwind or even a blizzard could be summoned or calmed. However, the basic spell will only affect the weather by some degree. Turning rain into snow, or cloud into a clear sky can be accomplished with the basic spell. Turning heavy snow into hot sunshine would require as many as 8 extra magic points. The basic form of this spell will last for 5 minutes, and extending this costs 2 magic points per extra 5 minutes.
