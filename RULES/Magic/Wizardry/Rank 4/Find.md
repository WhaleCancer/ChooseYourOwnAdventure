# Find (4)

This spell is similar to the Where's Home? spell, except that the target may be absolutely any physical thing or place. This spell will simply provide the direction to the nearest item of the specified type. Thus casting this spell to find "a gold piece" will simply provide the compass direction to the nearest gold piece. This spell does not provide accurate directions nor distance, so finding the exit from a dungeon will just point to the nearest dungeon exit regardless of what lies in between. As with "Where's Home?", the sensation of the direction will only persist for a short time, in this case one minute.
