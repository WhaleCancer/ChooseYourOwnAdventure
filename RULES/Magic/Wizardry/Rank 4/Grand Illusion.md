# Grand Illusion (4)

This spell is a more powerful version of the rank 1 Illusion spell, and can include other senses such as smell, sound and even touch. This means that anyone struck by the illusion will believe themselves to be injured. The Illusion will fight with a SKILL equivalent to the caster's MENTAL characteristic plus their Magic-Wizardry skill. Of course, any wounds inflicted by the Illusion will be just that; illusionary. Anyone "killed" by the Illusion will merely be unconscious for a round, and will then wake up realising what has happened. The illusion will otherwise last for 3 minutes.
