# Restrain (4)

This spell will bind the target object or creature in bands of magical energy, fixing them in place even if they are airborne! Once bound, the target cannot move a muscle, although they can still breathe. Even gravity will not affect a Restrained target, so a falling boulder or leaping combatant could both be fixed in the air. The spell lasts for three minutes, and normal physics will take over when the Restraint is removed. Up to 3 cubic metres may be affected by this spell.
