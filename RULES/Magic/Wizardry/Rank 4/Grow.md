# Grow (4)

When this spell is cast, the target, whether an object or being, will grow half as big again almost immediately. Thus a two metre tall man would grow to three metres in height! If a living creature, the target will benefit from the effects of a Strength spell due to his increased size, and clothing and armor will also grow to match their wearer. This spell will last for 3 minutes, but may be cast multiple times on one target. An additional casting on the aforementioned man will increase his height to 4 ½ metres, and provide the benefits of two Strength spells! An unwilling target will of course receive a test for LUCK.
