# Poison (4)

This spell can create a powerful poison from any small amount of liquid or edible item. It can also combine with a Fog spell to create a cloud of poison or even poison a target directly if the caster is touching bare flesh when the spell is cast. The poison is fast acting and immediately delivers STAMINA damage equal to 2 plus the total number of magic points put into the spell. A Wizard using an additional 6 magic points would thus create a poison inflicting 12 points of STAMINA damage.
