# Lightning Blast (4)

This powerful attack spell creates a huge bolt of lightning that automatically hits one target within 5m range. The spell causes 2D6+2 points of STAMINA damage to the target, and is not reduced by armor. This spell cannot be dodged or avoided, and only a Counter Spell or Wall will block the bolt. The basic range can be increased, with each additional 5m range costing 2 more magic points.
