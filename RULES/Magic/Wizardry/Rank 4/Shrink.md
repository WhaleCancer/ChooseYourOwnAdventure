# Shrink (4)

This spell is the reverse of the Grow spell, causing the target to shrink to half their normal size. Like Grow, it can be cast multiple times, shrinking the target by half each time. Whilst under the effects of one of these spells, the target will suffer the effects of a Weakness spell, due to their small size. This spell will last for 3 minutes or until cancelled by the caster.
