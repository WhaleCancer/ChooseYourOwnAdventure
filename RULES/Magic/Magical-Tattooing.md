# Magical Tattooing

Magical tattooists are found in port cities. Magical tattoos allow individuals to gain powers without extensive magical training.

## Practitioners

Magical tattooists are often indistinguishable from non-magical ones, frequently covered in tattoos themselves. This magical style should be restricted to Non-Player Characters (NPCs) due to limitations.

## New Effects

Magical tattoos take about an hour to ink, requiring standard needles and rare ink components. A tattooist needs to make a skill test upon completion, with a +4 bonus if properly equipped. Inking time can be reduced to 15 minutes, but without the test bonus. A failed skill test (specifically a double 6) results in a non-magical tattoo, rather than an "Oops table" roll. An individual can only have one magical tattoo, which cannot be removed once inscribed. The tattoo must be clearly visible to function; if covered by clothing or armor, it remains latent.

## Available Tattoos

### Rising Sun

**Ink component:** Brain ichor from a Nandibear

**Description:** This tattoo provides protection from extreme weather and temperature, preventing damage from normal heat or cold (food and water still required). It's popular with travelers.

### Spring of the Tiger

**Ink component:** Ground fang of a sabre-toothed tiger

**Description:** A stylized tiger motif that grants the bearer the speed of a jungle predator, providing a +1 bonus to attack total in the first melee round of hand-to-hand combat in any encounter.

### Eye of the Raptor

**Ink component:** Feathers of a Night Hawk

**Description:** An eagle-head design that gives the bearer sharp eyesight, adding a +1 bonus to their special skill in any Awareness test purely involving sight.

### Hood of the Cobra

**Ink component:** Poison glands of a poisonous snake

**Description:** This tattoo allows the bearer to mesmerize one living opponent by staring into their eyes. The target gets a Test for Luck; if failed, they are mesmerized and unable to act for three combat rounds. The bearer also cannot act during these rounds, and any overt attack breaks the trance.

### Guardian's Shield

**Ink component:** Carapace of a Grannit

**Description:** An elaborate shield design that must be inscribed on the forearm. The bearer cannot use a physical shield and gain the tattoo's benefits. It provides magical protection, reducing one point of damage on an armor roll of 6, and two points of damage on a 7. It's popular with mages (who cannot wear armor) and barbarians (who choose not to).

### Dive of the Dolphin

**Ink component:** The gills of a Flying Fish

**Description:** Allows underwater breathing for minutes equal to SKILL, but doesn't grant swimming. Requires SKILL hours of air breathing to recharge.

### Wings of the Harrun

**Ink component:** (Not specified in source)

**Description:** Features a gliding monkey, allowing the bearer to glide instead of plummeting, reducing falling damage by 100m. Works even if unconscious.

### Rune of the Archmage

**Ink component:** (Not specified in source)

**Description:** An ornate rune that stores magical power. Can be charged with 1-2 Magic Points or STAMINA points for later spellcasting. Glows when charged. Covered runes cannot be utilized but stored energy is not lost.

### Cloak of the Assassin

**Ink component:** (Not specified in source)

**Description:** Features a swirling black cloak, magically hiding the bearer. Requires the bearer to be absolutely still for the magic to work, granting a +4 bonus to stealth tests when still and hiding.

### Mask of the Jester

**Ink component:** Hair from an Elvin

**Description:** A jovial design featuring a jester's mask that improves the disposition of those the bearer meets. If the bearer is the spokesman and encounters creatures, they roll a D6. On a 5 or 6, the creatures' attitude improves by one step (Hostile > Unfriendly > Neutral > Friendly).
