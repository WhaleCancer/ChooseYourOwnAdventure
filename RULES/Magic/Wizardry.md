# Wizardry

Wizardry is a school of magic especially popular on the continent of Allansia, where it is taught by experienced practitioners to their apprentices. Some powerful Wizards even set up schools of magic and take on 3 or 4 apprentices at a time. The most famous of these is in the Forest of Yore, founded by the great Vermithrax Moonchaser. Apprentices are often chosen on the basis of ability rather than how much they can pay, but this is not always the case.

Wizardry magic draws its energy from the invisible arcane power that permeates the world of Titan, and the long apprenticeship of a Wizard uses the learning of many millennia to develop the knowledge to use this power. Thus Wizardry spells are powered by magic points, the in-game manifestation of the arcane power. A Wizard can only channel so much power in a single day, requiring a good sleep to recover their magic points.

## Casting Wizardry Spells

To cast a Wizardry spell follows the same principles as the standard spellcasting rules described above. A Wizard refers to his total of MENTAL characteristic and Magic-Wizardry skill as his "Arcane Power", which is recorded as such on his Character sheet.

Spells are graded by rank, with a spell requiring as many magic points to cast as its rank. Thus the simplest spells are rank 1, and cost 1 magic point to cast, whilst the most powerful are rank 8 and generally cost 8 magic points.

There are some modifiers to the spellcasting test listed below. In addition to these, a spellcaster may expend additional magic points to gain a +1 modifier to the spellcasting roll for each additional magic point.

### Casting Modifiers

| Wizardry Casting Situation | Modifier |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| Each round of preparation previous to casting | +2 |
| Quiet surroundings | +3 |
| Not under attack | +0 |
| Caster is Target of ranged attack | -1 |
| Caster is Target of melee attack | -2 |

A Wizard may also expend additional magic points when casting a spell to reduce the chance of a target successfully testing their LUCK. Each additional magic point thus spent is applied as a -1 penalty to the target's test for LUCK. Additional magic points spent must be declared before the spellcasting test is made.

### Armor Restrictions

If a Wizard wears any armor, then additional magic points must be expended for every spell cast as follows:

| Armor Worn | Extra MP Cost |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Leather Cuirass | +1 MP |
| Leather Hauberk / Chain Cuirass | +2 MP |
| Chain Hauberk / Breastplate | +3 MP |
| Plate armor | +4 MP |

## Learning New Spells

A Wizard will start play knowing only a few spells, and even those are of the lower tiers of power. At some point a Wizard Character will want to learn other spells, both of low and high power. One requirement is for available experience points, as described in [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md). If experience points are available, the caster must also have a way of learning the spell.

One way to do this is to find a teacher who already knows the spell. This approach will take 2 days of intense tuition for every rank of the spell. The teacher will probably require payment for this tuition, either in money, goods or services.

The second approach is to learn the spell from a spellbook that contains that specific spell. This way will take five full days of study, which need not be contiguous, per rank of the spell.

**Play Tips:** A Wizard Character will begin play knowing only a smallish selection of Spells, and will probably be very weak in a hand-to-hand fight. However, they are not weakened physically by casting their spells, and will probably be able to cast quite a few of the less powerful spells each day. They should however bear in mind that once their power is gone for the day, it is gone. A Wizard Character walks a fine line between using up all of their magic before a powerful enemy is reached, and reserving their power for a powerful enemy that never appears and thus not helping their colleagues along the way.

Wizards are however a good choice for novice players who would like to have a magician Character as they have a defined role and a limited number of spells to learn.

It is also important to note that the Game Master controls the availability of spells for his Wizard characters, both by allowing them to find spell books containing new spells, but also by determining which spells teachers will instruct. A player may desperately want to learn the Death spell, but unless he has a way of learning it, as determined by the Game Master, he will never be able to cast it.

## Wizardry Spells

The spells listed below are the most common of the Allansian Wizardry spells known. There will be other schools of wizardry and indeed other spells, so the Game Master should feel free to add in new spells as required.

The numbers listed for each spell in brackets after the name refer to both the rank of the spell and the base magic point cost for the spell. Some spells have a rank listed as a modifier, such as +1, which is explained further in the spell description.

### Rank 1 Spells

#### Befuddle (1)

This spell will cause one touched target, who may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, to become very confused for one minute. The target will struggle to make active decisions, and all active tests such as combat, spellcasting, lock picking, social tests etc will be made with a penalty of -6. The target will however try and avoid danger wherever possible and retreat to a safe place where they will just stand with a glazed look.

#### Darkness (1)

When cast, this spell will create a 5m radius circle of absolute darkness around the caster. The area of darkness will not move, and will cancel out both normal light and the Dark Seeing talent. The darkness can be cancelled with a Light spell or a counterspell, but will otherwise last for 3 minutes.

#### Fear (1)

This spell will induce terror in one target, which may be resisted with a test for LUCK. If the spell does take effect, the target will for two minutes attempt to get as far away from the caster as possible. At the end of this time, the fear will abruptly disappear and the target may act as normal.

#### Fire Bolt (1)

This common spell will hurl a small bolt of intense fire at one target within 100m from the pointed finger of the caster. The target may either test for LUCK or instead attempt a Dodge test to avoid being hit by the bolt. A target that is hit will lose 1D6 STAMINA in fire damage, and if especially flammable, may be ignited.

#### Flash! (1)

This spell will cause a brief but very bright flash of light to emanate from just in front of the caster. Anyone within sight will be blinded for 1D6 minutes (rolled separately for each target) unless they state that they will be closing their eyes or successfully test for LUCK. The caster may also choose to close his eyes. Anyone who does state they are closing their eyes will suffer a penalty of -4 to all actions for that combat round. The only exception to this is that the caster will not have a penalty to casting this spell. If cast in an area of magical darkness, the gloom will be dispersed for one round only before returning.

#### Glowing Eyes (1)

This popular spell will cause the caster's eyes (or one touched target) to glow with a colour chosen by the caster for up to five minutes, although this may be cancelled at will by the caster. The glow is equivalent to a Glimmer minor magic spell, but may also give a bonus to intimidation effects and may impress primitive folks.

#### Ignite (1)

When cast, this spell will cause something flammable to burst into flame (equivalent to a small fire), which is thereafter treated as a normal fire. The target must normally be touched, although the expenditure of an additional magic point will allow a range of 5m, with each additional magic point adding another 5m. This spell will not ignite a living creature unless they are especially flammable.

#### Illusion (1)

This spell will allow the caster to create one defined visual illusion. However, the illusion has no physical presence, and so will be dispelled if a creature touches it, or indeed it touches a creature, or after three minutes. A target will not normally have a test for LUCK to avoid the illusion, although in some circumstances this may be allowed. As an example, an illusionary bridge over a chasm will vanish as soon as a character steps onto it. There would be no test for LUCK to avoid the illusion itself, although there could be a test for LUCK to avoid falling into the chasm when the "bridge" is stepped on.

#### Ironhand (1)

This very popular spell grants either the caster or one touched target an increase of 1 to their SKILL characteristic. This will apply to all tests that would be taken against SKILL, and lasts for three minutes. Only one of these spells may be active at any one time on any one target.

#### Light (1)

When cast upon one inanimate object such as a staff, sword or shield, this spell will create an area of magical light (about the size of a human fist) that glows steadily with the same intensity as a torch. This light lasts for 15 minutes, but may be cancelled at will by the caster. This light will be blacked out by a Darkness spell, but will in turn cancel out an existing Darkness spell.

#### Lock (1)

This spell will magically lock a chest or door without needing a physical key or lock. An open spell will cancel the effect, as can the caster just by willing it, but otherwise the door or chest must be physically broken to open it. This spell will not imbue the door or chest with any extra physical integrity.

#### Open (1)

This spell will open any physical lock or cancel out a magical Lock spell. The door, chest or lock must be touched to be affected.

#### Peace (1)

This spell will cause any two people within 5m to be calmed down, with a test for LUCK allowed to resist the spell. This will only happen if the targets are not actively fighting, and will also not prevent calmed targets from assisting friends who are being attacked. The expenditure of additional magic points will allow 2 more targets to be affected for each additional magic point spent. This spell will last for 2D6 minutes (rolled in secret) and will be a fragile peace, which will be broken if an unaffected person attacks a calmed target.

#### Personalise Spell (+1)

This rank 1 spell is very popular among the flashier Wizards as it allows a spell to manifest in a particular way. Thus a Fear spell may appear as dark shadows that swirl round the target inducing terror, and a Restrain spell may appear as golden chains wrapped around the victim. Despite being a rank 1 spell, there may be an additional +1 to +6 magic point cost depending on the extent of the Personalisation. This additional cost is decided by the Game Master based upon the specification of the player. The Personalise spell is not cast separately, and so there will only be one spellcasting test.

#### Strength (1)

This spell imbues the caster or one touched target with the strength of a troll for up to one minute. This will add an additional +2 to the Strength Skill of the target and also to damage rolls made in hand to hand combat whilst the spell is active.

#### Thunder (1)

In some ways similar to the Flash! spell, this spell will create a momentary special effect; In this case a deafening clap of thunder. This massive boom can be heard up to a kilometre away, and will deafen anyone within 20m who does not test for LUCK. The caster will not be affected. Affected targets will be mostly deaf for 1D6 minutes and will struggle with communication during this time.

If the caster also knows the Flash! Spell, these may be combined into one spell (requiring one combat round to cast and one spellcasting test but costing 2 magic points) for a potent burst of sound and light.

#### Tongue Twister (1)

When cast, this spell causes the target's tongue to be temporarily tangled and unable to speak for a whole minute. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects of the spell, but if failed will of course prevent spellcasting. The range for the spell is 5m, although each additional magic point expended will increase this range by 5m.

#### Ward (1)

Unusually, this spell may be cast in the same round as another action or even another spell. When cast, the spell deflects one arrow, spear or other thrown or fired missile away from the caster. It will only work against one missile, will only protect the caster and may only be used once per round. This spell will not work against magical bolts or spells.

#### Weakness (1)

This spell may be cast against one target within 5m who may test for LUCK to avoid the detrimental effects. If affected, the target suffers a -1 penalty to both the SKILL characteristic and any damage rolls for 5 minutes.

### Rank 2 Spells

#### Animate (2)

An incredibly useful spell much used by southern mystics to create impressive rope tricks, this spell will animate either one small item or very small item within 5m of the caster. The animated objects may not actually fly, but may "hop", slither or leap through the air and will be much stronger than their size would suggest. A flexible object may articulate itself so that a rope could tie a knot in itself or a cloak could wrap itself around a person or object. The animated object may be used to fight with an Attack Strength equal to the caster's MENTAL Characteristic plus Wizardry Skill. If however the item loses a combat round and is thus struck, the spell ends and the item loses all animation.

The spell will otherwise last for two minutes, although this may be extended by one minute for each additional magic point extended. A medium sized object may be animated with the expenditure of 2 additional magic points, a large object for an additional 4 and a very large object for 6 additional magic points.

#### Breach (2)

This spell applies raw force to an inanimate object such as a wall, gate or door. It has a range of 5m, and will reduce one cubic metre to rubble or splinters. Additional cubic metres may be added to the effect at a cost of 2 additional magic points per cubic metre. The debris produced may still partially block the breach and will need to be manually cleared.

#### Breathe (2)

When cast, this spell will allow either the caster or one touched target to breathe for 15 minutes regardless of the quality or indeed lack of air. Thus the recipient of this spell could breathe underwater, in a smoke filled room or even in a vacuum. The caster can still breathe normally in a standard environment.

#### Combine (+2)

This useful spell allows two other spells to be combined together. These spells together will all take only a single round to cast, but an individual spellcasting test must be made for each spell and magic points must be spent for all of the spells, both those that are combined and the Combine spell itself. If any of the individual spellcasting tests fail, all of the spells will fail. Equally, if more than one spellcasting tests results in a double 6, a separate Oops roll must be made for each double 6.

#### Concentrate (+2)

If this spell is cast on the round before any other spell, the second spell will be re-cast immediately its duration expires without requiring a new spellcasting test or indeed any time. Magic points will be expended again at the time of recasting, and the recast spell will be recast in exactly the same form as the original casting.

#### Consume (2)

This spell makes use of the awesome power of fire, and will envelop one target in flame equivalent to a large fire. The target must be within 5m, and if a living being may test for LUCK to avoid the effects. If the test is failed or the spell cast on an inanimate object, the target will be ignited by the spell (as long as the target is flammable of course). The large fire will then burn normally as described in [Combat](./RULES/Combat.md).

#### Counterspell (2)

When cast, this spell will cancel one other spell either in effect or in the process of being cast. Although the technical rank of the counterspell is 2, the magic point cost is actually equal to the rank of the spell being cancelled plus 1. Minor magic spells count as rank 0 spells for the purposes of Counterspell. A Wizard may however only counter spells that have a rank less than his own MENTAL Characteristic.

When actually making the spellcasting test, the Counterspell caster must apply a special negative modifier equal to the rank of the spell being cancelled. If this spell is cast successfully, the target spell is snuffed out before it can take effect (if being cast) or immediately cancels the target spell (if already in effect).

It is suggested that a Wizard be able to change his declared action to counter a spell being cast, although this would of course mean abandoning his already declared action.

#### Darksee (2)

This simple spell endows the caster or one touched target to receive the benefits of the Dark Seeing talent for 20 minutes.

#### Ensure (2)

Nominally a rank 2 spell, this casting will prevent a catastrophic magical failure. This spell is cast at the same time as any other spell, and costs the same number of magic points as the spell it is Ensuring. Only one spellcasting test is made, but if a double 6 is rolled, the caster need not roll on the Oops table. Although costly, this spell may well prevent catastrophe visiting the caster.

#### ESP (2)

This spell, which has a range of 10m, allows the caster to look into the mind of one other living creature. The target may receive a test for LUCK to block the spell, but if failed the caster can see the emotions and general thoughts of the target. Individual thoughts or ideas cannot be read, but the caster would be able to tell if the target was angry, was friendly towards the caster or was about to attack. The spell lasts for 1 minute, but the caster must concentrate for that time for the spell to continue working.

#### Farseeing (2)

This spell grants the caster with eyesight as good as an eagle for 15 minutes. The caster receives a +3 bonus to all sight-based awareness tests and can see for many kilometres, assuming line of sight.

#### Fog (2)

This spell is in some ways similar to the Darkness spell, but it covers a larger area of 15m radius and lasts for 15 minutes. The affected area is filled with very thick grey fog with a visibility of less than a metre. All physical activity will be at a penalty of -6 and ranged attacks will be impossible. Dark Seeing will not help in this magical fog.

#### Force Bolt (2)

A similar spell to Fire Bolt, this spell flings a compact bolt of highly charged electricity that will hit a target for 1-6 points of damage, unaffected by armor. This bolt is so fast that it cannot be dodged or avoided, except by use of a Counterspell or Wall spell.

#### Languages (2)

This spell grants the caster or one nominated target a Language skill of 4 in one specific language. This ability does not grant the ability to read or write the language, but does give almost complete spoken fluency. This spell will last for 1 hour.

#### Levitate (2)

This spell removes the effects of gravity from the caster, one other being, or one inanimate object. If the target is unwilling, he will receive a test for LUCK to resist the effects. When active, the target can float up or down at will (at walking pace), under the control of the caster. The levitated being may pull themselves sideways if there are handholds nearby, and may also be affected by strong winds. The spell lasts for 5 minutes, and when it ends the target will float gently back down to the ground.

#### Mirror Selves (2)

When cast, this illusion will create two copies of the caster, all of which will act in a similar way. In a fight, this spell will mean that only 1 in 3 successful attacks will actually hit the real caster, and the caster will also count as three people for the purposes of outnumbering and any bonuses thereof (although the copies will not cause any damage). Even if a copy is the one hit, it will not disappear, with the spell lasting for 3 minutes.

#### See Through (2)

This spell allows the caster to see through a solid object and see what is beyond. The basic spell will allow the caster to see through an object up to 1 metre thick. If the object is more than 1 metre thick, the caster may add in additional magic points, extending the "view" by 1 metre each time. The spell will last for 1 minute once the final magic point has been used. This spell will however only affect one object.

#### Sentry (2)

Ideal when camping or resting, this spell will post a magical guard up to 20m from the caster. This invisible presence will sound the alarm should anyone unwanted approach the camp. The classification of unwanted is based upon the caster's own viewpoint. This sentry will cover a 90° arc and so in the open four sentries would be required to alert the caster. The alert can be an audible sound (emanating from the location of the sentry itself) or a mental alert to the caster. The sentries can detect hidden and invisible enemies.

This spell could also be placed upon the mouth of a pouch, lid of a chest etc. The spell will last for 24 hours or until the caster moves more than 20m from the location of the sentry.

#### Sleep (2)

This spell will put one victim to sleep for 5 minutes. The target may test for LUCK to avoid the effects, but if affected, the sleep is normal. The victim may be woken by loud noises, wounds, shaking etc. A Character may automatically kill most sleeping opponents, although this is considered bad form in most cases!

#### Starry Orb (2)

This spell will create a wondrous ball of glowing light and weaving fire, suspended in the air up to 10m away from the caster. This orb will distract and transfix all who see it close at hand (within 3m). Creatures who have average intelligence or less will be hypnotised on a roll of 1-4 on 1D6. A creature with high intelligence (including Characters) may test for LUCK or test against SKILL to avoid being transfixed. Any hypnotised victims simply stare agape at the orb for the 1 minute duration of the spell. The orb cannot be moved from its original location.

#### Strong Arm (2)

This handy and popular spell adds 2 to a specific hand-to-hand weapon skill, either for the caster or one touched target. The weapon skill must be nominated by the caster at the time the spell is cast, and any one target may only benefit from one of these spells at a time. The spell lasts for 10 minutes.

#### Sure Shot (2)

This spell is similar to the Strong Arm spell, but instead applies to a single missile weapon skill.

#### Where's Home (2)

This spell will prevent a Wizard being lost in the wilderness. When cast, the caster will instantly be aware of the direction that one named place lies in. This could indeed be the caster's home, but could also be one other place known to the caster either from a visit or from an accurate map. This awareness of the direction does not imply the safest or even a passable route, and only lasts for a few seconds.

### Rank 4 Spells

#### Arrow-Snake (4)

This nasty spell causes one arrow notched on a bow and ready for firing to instantly turn into a venomous snake! The snake will land one automatic bite on the victim (use small bite matrix) with an additional 2 points of damage for the venom. The snake will then continue to attack the target (SKILL 7 and STAMINA 3). The range of this spell is 10m, and the target does not get a test for LUCK as they spell does not affect them directly.

#### Command (4)

This powerful spell will allow the caster to issue a single command to another being. The target may of course test for LUCK to avoid the spell, but if failed, must obey the command. This single command cannot be something that would directly and obviously be harmful. Thus a Goblin could be commanded to close its eyes in combat or drop its weapons, but could not be commanded to stab itself or throw itself off a cliff. It is important to note that the caster does not need to speak the language of the target. The effects of the command cannot last longer than 30 seconds, and the Game Master has the final say on what does and does not constitute a valid Command.

#### Explode (4)

This spell is similar to the Breach spell, but causes the target to explode violently as if blown apart by a huge amount of gunpowder. The target may be up to 50m away, and the base spell will explode up to one cubic metre of material. The amount of target exploded may be increased by expending an additional 4 magic points per cubic metre. This spell is very slow to cast, requiring 5 minutes of uninterrupted casting and preparation per cubic metre to be exploded. However, when the spell is completed, the targeted material will explode outwards, damaging an area around the blast equal to 2 metres for every cubic metre. The exact damage inflicted on any targets in this blast zone will depend on both the distance and the material exploded. If a living target is to be exploded with this spell, he receives a test for LUCK to resist the spell.

#### Find (4)

This spell is similar to the Where's Home? spell, except that the target may be absolutely any physical thing or place. This spell will simply provide the direction to the nearest item of the specified type. Thus casting this spell to find "a gold piece" will simply provide the compass direction to the nearest gold piece. This spell does not provide accurate directions nor distance, so finding the exit from a dungeon will just point to the nearest dungeon exit regardless of what lies in between. As with "Where's Home?", the sensation of the direction will only persist for a short time, in this case one minute.

#### Fly (4)

This spell is a more powerful version of the Levitate spell, and allows the caster or target to fly in any direction at running pace. The target has full control over their movements. The spell lasts 5 minutes and like Levitate, the flying creature will gently float to the ground when the spell expires. The caster can carry a weight equivalent to that he could carry comfortably on foot.

#### Gills (4)

This spell affects either the caster or one target, who must be touched. An unwilling target may test for LUCK as usual to avoid the spell. This spell creates a magical pair of gills on the neck of the target, allowing them to breathe underwater. However, these gills do bypass the normal breathing arrangements and so if the target is not underwater, the target may well suffocate. This spell is permanent until cancelled by the caster or by a Counter Spell by another Wizard.

#### Grand Illusion (4)

This spell is a more powerful version of the rank 1 Illusion spell, and can include other senses such as smell, sound and even touch. This means that anyone struck by the illusion will believe themselves to be injured. The Illusion will fight with a SKILL equivalent to the caster's MENTAL characteristic plus their Magic-Wizardry skill. Of course, any wounds inflicted by the Illusion will be just that; illusionary. Anyone "killed" by the Illusion will merely be unconscious for a round, and will then wake up realising what has happened. The illusion will otherwise last for 3 minutes.

#### Grow (4)

When this spell is cast, the target, whether an object or being, will grow half as big again almost immediately. Thus a two metre tall man would grow to three metres in height! If a living creature, the target will benefit from the effects of a Strength spell due to his increased size, and clothing and armor will also grow to match their wearer. This spell will last for 3 minutes, but may be cast multiple times on one target. An additional casting on the aforementioned man will increase his height to 4 ½ metres, and provide the benefits of two Strength spells! An unwilling target will of course receive a test for LUCK.

#### Invisibility (4)

This handy spell will turn the caster or one other target invisible, along with currently carried clothes and equipment. This spell will not however make the target silent, and doors etc will still need to be opened. The effects will last for 3 minutes or until the caster either hits an opponent, is hit by an opponent or casts another spell.

#### Lightning Blast (4)

This powerful attack spell creates a huge bolt of lightning that automatically hits one target within 5m range. The spell causes 2D6+2 points of STAMINA damage to the target, and is not reduced by armor. This spell cannot be dodged or avoided, and only a Counter Spell or Wall will block the bolt. The basic range can be increased, with each additional 5m range costing 2 more magic points.

#### Magic Bridge (4)

When cast, this spell will create a magical bridge across a chasm, river or other impassable area. Requiring a solid footing at either end, the bridge will span 5 metres for every 4 magic points put into it. The bridge is wide enough for one person, and will support as many people as it took magic points to cast. The bridge will last for 5 minutes, but will start to fade gently after 4 minutes.

#### Poison (4)

This spell can create a powerful poison from any small amount of liquid or edible item. It can also combine with a Fog spell to create a cloud of poison or even poison a target directly if the caster is touching bare flesh when the spell is cast. The poison is fast acting and immediately delivers STAMINA damage equal to 2 plus the total number of magic points put into the spell. A Wizard using an additional 6 magic points would thus create a poison inflicting 12 points of STAMINA damage.

#### Restrain (4)

This spell will bind the target object or creature in bands of magical energy, fixing them in place even if they are airborne! Once bound, the target cannot move a muscle, although they can still breathe. Even gravity will not affect a Restrained target, so a falling boulder or leaping combatant could both be fixed in the air. The spell lasts for three minutes, and normal physics will take over when the Restraint is removed. Up to 3 cubic metres may be affected by this spell.

#### Shrink (4)

This spell is the reverse of the Grow spell, causing the target to shrink to half their normal size. Like Grow, it can be cast multiple times, shrinking the target by half each time. Whilst under the effects of one of these spells, the target will suffer the effects of a Weakness spell, due to their small size. This spell will last for 3 minutes or until cancelled by the caster.

#### Speak to Animals (4)

Similar to the Languages spell, this useful casting will allow the caster to speak to any animal for the following 10 minutes. Although the caster can communicate, this does not guarantee that the animal will be interested in talking as some have very limited attention spans!

#### Wall (4)

This spell creates a circular wall, 5m in diameter, around the caster or one nominated object. The wall lasts 5 minutes, and is completely impervious to all attacks, objects and even spells. Only a Counter Spell can cancel the wall, although if anything or anyone inside touches the wall, it will disappear immediately. The wall will remain stationary for the duration.

#### Weather Control (4)

This spell utilises multiple elemental controls to control the local weather as desired by the caster. It will only affect the weather directly overhead. This spell can affect an area the size of a small village or field. Unusual weather such as heavy rain, a small whirlwind or even a blizzard could be summoned or calmed. However, the basic spell will only affect the weather by some degree. Turning rain into snow, or cloud into a clear sky can be accomplished with the basic spell. Turning heavy snow into hot sunshine would require as many as 8 extra magic points. The basic form of this spell will last for 5 minutes, and extending this costs 2 magic points per extra 5 minutes.

### Rank 6 Spells

#### Banish Undead (6)

This spell will destroy the lifeforce that animates one single undead, thus returning it to a peaceful rest. Whilst the target may attempt to resist the spell as normal, the test is reduced by the MENTAL characteristic of the caster. An undead creature banished by this spell can never be animated again, so this spell is sometimes cast on the bodies of dead heroes to prevent them ever being raised.

#### Cockroach (6)

This particularly nasty spell has featured in many legends and folk tales, where it has turned Characters into frogs, cockroaches or mice. Thus if the target fails their test for LUCK, they permanently become a small and inoffensive creature of the caster's choice. Their clothes and other possessions are not affected, and so drop to the ground where their owner once stood. The poor victim still retains their knowledge and consciousness but can only speak in an animal language. The caster may reverse this spell by touching the target and willing it so, otherwise only a counterspell can reverse the transformation.

#### Exchange Shape (6)

This spell requires the Wizard to touch the victim whilst the spell is cast; If the target fails his test for LUCK, the Wizard and target exchange bodies! The caster will retain his own characteristics, but will of course be free of most curses, poisons and diseases that the old body suffered from. This spell is permanent, although a successful counterspell will reverse it, forcing the original caster back into his own body, wherever that might be. If the caster's original body has died, the counterspell will effectively kill him. The caster will however acquire any special abilities the new body possesses. Thus a caster Exchanging Shape with a Birdman will be able to fly, even if a bit of practice is required first.

#### Hurricane (6)

This specialised version of the Weather Control spell conjures up a 30 metre radius storm around the caster, with ferocious winds, hail, rain and even snow. Everyone caught in the area of effect (except the caster) must test either their LUCK or SKILL or be blown right off their feet, suffering 1D3 points of STAMINA damage in the process. Attempting to stand or move away requires another test. Combat, spellcasting and conversation are almost impossible within the area of effect, with the Hurricane lasting 5 minutes. The caster himself must concentrate throughout the duration and may take no other actions. It is also possible that other objects or even buildings within the area may be damaged by the spell.

#### Petrify (6)

This powerful spell will start turning one target, who must be within 5 metres, to stone. Starting with the feet, and creeping slowly upwards, the target will lose 1 STAMINA and 1 SKILL every two combat rounds until his current STAMINA score reaches 0 (SKILL will stop declining at 0). When this has happened, the target, his clothes and equipment included, will be completely made of stone. The process can be reversed if a counterspell is cast or the caster is killed before the process is completed. If the victim is fully petrified, he can never be turned back.

#### Raise Skeleton (6)

A favourite with Necromancers, this spell will animate a corpse with a spark of living spirit, forcing it to return as an undead under the control of the caster. The spell itself takes a whole hour to cast, and requires a corpse of some kind. If the corpse is incomplete, the resulting skeleton will be missing that body part. The caster must be close to the skeleton to issue it with orders; Said orders will be followed literally until countermanded by the Necromancer.

By expending different amounts of magic points, other undead may be created as follows: Crypt Stalker (7), Skeleton Warrior (7), Zombie (7), Decayer (8) or Ghoul (8).

A Necromancer may have a maximum of four Raised Undead at any one time for every point he has in his combined MENTAL characteristic and Magic-Wizardry skill.

It should also be noted that Raising Undead is considered an evil act in most lands.

#### See Future (6)

This spell allows the caster to see brief scenes from the near future of either himself or one known person. The future in this case is no more than 2 days, and the visions are often confusing and obscure. The visions are of events that will probably happen, but intervening events may change this. This spell often presents problems for the Game Master, as he will be required to predict what will happen…..

#### Teleport (6)

This spell is a very powerful addition to the repertoire of any Wizard. This spell will allow the caster to travel instantly between two places that are less than 10km apart! The caster must have some idea of where he will appear, although a very good description would suffice from someone who knows the place well. The spell will transport the caster and whatever he can carry in his hands (including up to one other person) to the target location. Assuming the spell works correctly, the caster appears immediately.

#### Wall of Power (6)

This spell is a more powerful version of the Wall spell, and creates a similar barrier around the caster, although this one is dome-shaped, and can be increased in size by spending an additional 3 magic points for every extra 5 metres diameter. This wall will not only keep enemies out, but will actively damage any who try to pass through. Any being touching the outside of the wall will take 3D6 points of damage (armor will protect against this damage), and although they will not be able to pass through the wall, will continue to take damage on each round they are in contact with it. Lasting five minutes, this spell can only be removed with a counterspell, or another wall of power (which destroys both walls).

#### Web (6)

This spell will fill an area up to 5 metres in diameter with strong, sticky spider webs. Anyone within the area will be bound by multiple strands and completely immobilised. A very strong victim such as a Troll or Giant can break out in two rounds, and any Character with the Strength skill can break out after two successful Strength tests. Characters without the Strength skill must wait for the 5 minute duration to elapse before they are freed.

### Rank 8 Spells

#### Assassin's Dagger (8)

This spell is much beloved of evil Wizards, to be used against luckless Characters who have escaped their grasp. When cast upon a known enemy, this spell creates a ghostly hand holding a dagger. This hand immediately sets off directly towards its target at a steady walking pace. Whilst not very fast, the hand is relentless and never stops or rests, and will float ever onwards towards its victim. The hand can be trapped for a short while if the victim is ingenious enough, although this will only ever be short term relief. If the hand does catch up with its victim, It attacks with SKILL 10, but never takes any damage if it loses a combat round. The only way to cancel the curse is to cast a counterspell on the hand (which must be present).

#### Death (8)

This very potent spell will kill one target within 5 metres instantly, and there is no test for LUCK to avoid the effects! This spell does actually cost the caster 12 Magic points (not 8) and ages him one year, although that is little consolation to the victim!

#### Earthquake (8)

This spell will cause a massive earthquake in the local area, affecting a radius of 50 metres. The earthquake will last for 1 minute, and will cause massive damage to buildings and structures. Any Characters caught in the area will need to test their SKILL or LUCK every round to avoid falling over, and will take 1D6 points of damage if they do fall. The Game Master will need to adjudicate the effects on buildings and other structures.
