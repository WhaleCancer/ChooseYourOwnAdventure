# Wizardry

Wizardry is a school of magic especially popular on the continent of Allansia, where it is taught by experienced practitioners to their apprentices. Some powerful Wizards even set up schools of magic and take on 3 or 4 apprentices at a time. The most famous of these is in the Forest of Yore, founded by the great Vermithrax Moonchaser. Apprentices are often chosen on the basis of ability rather than how much they can pay, but this is not always the case.

Wizardry magic draws its energy from the invisible arcane power that permeates the world of Titan, and the long apprenticeship of a Wizard uses the learning of many millennia to develop the knowledge to use this power. Thus Wizardry spells are powered by magic points, the in-game manifestation of the arcane power. A Wizard can only channel so much power in a single day, requiring a good sleep to recover their magic points.

## Casting Wizardry Spells

To cast a Wizardry spell follows the same principles as the standard spellcasting rules described above. A Wizard refers to his total of MENTAL characteristic and Magic-Wizardry skill as his "Arcane Power", which is recorded as such on his Character sheet.

Spells are graded by rank, with a spell requiring as many magic points to cast as its rank. Thus the simplest spells are rank 1, and cost 1 magic point to cast, whilst the most powerful are rank 8 and generally cost 8 magic points.

There are some modifiers to the spellcasting test listed below. In addition to these, a spellcaster may expend additional magic points to gain a +1 modifier to the spellcasting roll for each additional magic point.

### Casting Modifiers

| Wizardry Casting Situation | Modifier |
| --------------------------- | -------- |
| Each round of preparation previous to casting | +2 |
| Quiet surroundings | +3 |
| Not under attack | +0 |
| Caster is Target of ranged attack | -1 |
| Caster is Target of melee attack | -2 |

A Wizard may also expend additional magic points when casting a spell to reduce the chance of a target successfully testing their LUCK. Each additional magic point thus spent is applied as a -1 penalty to the target's test for LUCK. Additional magic points spent must be declared before the spellcasting test is made.

### Armor Restrictions

If a Wizard wears any armor, then additional magic points must be expended for every spell cast as follows:

| Armor Worn | Extra MP Cost |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Leather Cuirass | +1 MP |
| Leather Hauberk / Chain Cuirass | +2 MP |
| Chain Hauberk / Breastplate | +3 MP |
| Plate armor | +4 MP |

## Learning New Spells

A Wizard will start play knowing only a few spells, and even those are of the lower tiers of power. At some point a Wizard Character will want to learn other spells, both of low and high power. One requirement is for available experience points, as described in [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md). If experience points are available, the caster must also have a way of learning the spell.

One way to do this is to find a teacher who already knows the spell. This approach will take 2 days of intense tuition for every rank of the spell. The teacher will probably require payment for this tuition, either in money, goods or services.

The second approach is to learn the spell from a spellbook that contains that specific spell. This way will take five full days of study, which need not be contiguous, per rank of the spell.

**Play Tips:** A Wizard Character will begin play knowing only a smallish selection of Spells, and will probably be very weak in a hand-to-hand fight. However, they are not weakened physically by casting their spells, and will probably be able to cast quite a few of the less powerful spells each day. They should however bear in mind that once their power is gone for the day, it is gone. A Wizard Character walks a fine line between using up all of their magic before a powerful enemy is reached, and reserving their power for a powerful enemy that never appears and thus not helping their colleagues along the way.

Wizards are however a good choice for novice players who would like to have a magician Character as they have a defined role and a limited number of spells to learn.

It is also important to note that the Game Master controls the availability of spells for his Wizard characters, both by allowing them to find spell books containing new spells, but also by determining which spells teachers will instruct. A player may desperately want to learn the Death spell, but unless he has a way of learning it, as determined by the Game Master, he will never be able to cast it.

## Wizardry Spells

The spells listed below are the most common of the Allansian Wizardry spells known. There will be other schools of wizardry and indeed other spells, so the Game Master should feel free to add in new spells as required.

The numbers listed for each spell in brackets after the name refer to both the rank of the spell and the base magic point cost for the spell. Some spells have a rank listed as a modifier, such as +1, which is explained further in the spell description.
