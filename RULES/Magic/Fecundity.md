# Fecundity

Grove Tenders are magic users fascinated by plants, distinct from druids. They are also known as Glade Wardens, Gardeners, and Tree Mages, and draw power from their home groves.

## Harvest

Grove Tenders use MAGIC and a new skill, [Magic-Fecundity](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Fecundity.md), to achieve a 'Harvest' score, equivalent to Arcane Power or Inner Strength.

## Skill Requirements

Grove Tenders require at least one point in Plant Lore, and one point in Herb Lore if using the Titan Herbal companion book. The Grove Tender archetype has great synergy with the Titan Herbal book.

## Seed Pods

Grove Tenders can carry 'seed pods' (large seed/nut-like objects, 10 per inventory slot) to power spells, even away from their glade, though growing them away from home is slower.

Seed pods remain potent for one week per point of Harvest score, and a Grove Tender can carry pods equal to their Harvest score; carrying more will cause them to spoil due to excessive natural magics.

## Grove Tender Spells

The spells listed below are the most common Grove Tender spells known. There will be other spells, so the Game Master should feel free to add in new spells as required.
