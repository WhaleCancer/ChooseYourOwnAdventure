# Illusionism

Illusionism is a variant of Wizardry, focusing on deception and magical mirages. It was developed by Gnomes and spread by figures like Erridansis Whitewolf. Gnomes are particularly proficient in it.

## Shapeworking

Illusionist spells are cast like Wizardry spells, using the [Magic-Illusionism](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Illusionism.md) special skill. The combined total of MAGIC and Magic-Illusionism is called "Shapeworking."

## Primary Magical Style

Illusionism is a Primary magical style. Only creatures with senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch) are affected by illusions. Golems, skeletons, or magically animated swords are not affected.

## Illusionism Spells

The spells listed below are the most common Illusionism spells known. There will be other spells, so the Game Master should feel free to add in new spells as required.

The numbers listed for each spell in brackets after the name refer to both the rank of the spell and the base magic point cost for the spell.
