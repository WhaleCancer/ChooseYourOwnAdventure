# Rime (4)

**Element:** Water/Air

**Engraved Upon:** Armour

This rune causes the rune carver's armour to be covered in a layer of cloying, chilling ice for rounds equal to their Runic Knowledge. Anyone striking them must make a test of SKILL (Strength skill may be used) or find their weapon is stuck fast in the rime. They may make a Strength skill test to pull it back out each round. This effect can be used to stick the engraver to a surface if they bring their armour in contact with, so they could 'glue' themselves to a wall, door or slope for example.
