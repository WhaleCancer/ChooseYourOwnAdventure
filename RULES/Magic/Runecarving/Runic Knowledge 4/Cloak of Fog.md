# Cloak of Fog (4)

**Element:** Air/Water

**Engraved Upon:** Any item worn by the Carver

Upon activation, the caster is enveloped in a fog that extends a number of yards equal to their Runic Knowledge. The fog trails with them provided they move no faster than walking pace and lasts for a number of rounds equal to their Runic Knowledge. The fog obscures vision providing heavy cover to anyone firing into or out of the fog. A strong wind or similar effect can dissipate the fog.
