# The Gale (3)

**Element:** Air

**Engraved Upon:** Any Item

When you activate this rune a great wind emanates in a cone in front of the engraver. The cone is 30' long and 30' wide at the end. It lasts for two rounds. Missile fire into the area has a -4 penalty and anyone apart from the rune carver must make a contested roll (their SKILL vs the Runic Knowledge of the caster) or be unbalanced. The Gale moves with the caster.
