# Lightning (3)

**Element:** Air

**Engraved Upon:** Any Weapon

Activating this rune causes sparks to dance along your weapon. Any time you hit your target they must make a 3d6 test against STAMINA or be dazed for one round. The effect lasts half your Runic Knowledge, rounded down, in rounds. A stronger version costing 5 Runic Knowledge increases the test to 5d6.
