# Landslide (3)

**Element:** Earth

**Engraved Upon:** Any item worn by the Carver

Upon activation, the engraver becomes an unstoppable battering ram, surging forward 30' in a straight line. Anything in their path must make a test vs SKILL or be knocked back 10' away from the line and left prone. Those that pass the test are still unbalanced. Large creatures or those with four (or more) legs that pass are unaffected (Director's discretion). This movement is very sudden and doesn't trigger any free attacks or count as fleeing from combat.
