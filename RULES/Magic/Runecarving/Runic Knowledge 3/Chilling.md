# Chilling (3)

**Element:** Water / Air

**Engraved Upon:** Any Weapon

Upon use, this rune causes your weapon to be encased in chilling frost. Upon a successful hit (one where you cause damage) your target must test 3d6 vs STAMINA or be slowed. The effect lasts half your Runic Knowledge, rounded down, in rounds. A stronger version costing 5 Runic Knowledge increases the test to 5d6.
