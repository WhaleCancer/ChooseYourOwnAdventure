# Arrow Cutting (1)

**Element:** Air

**Engraved Upon:** Any Weapon or a Shield

Upon activation when a missile (arrow, bolt or thrown) is speeding toward the engraver, this rune causes their weapon (or shield) to intercept the danger, knocking it away. Obviously, the Rune Carver must be aware of the attack and they must activate the rune before any damage rolls are made. It has a single use.
