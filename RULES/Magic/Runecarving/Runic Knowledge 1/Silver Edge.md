# Silver Edge (1)

**Element:** Earth

**Engraved Upon:** Any Weapon

Using this rune causes the carver's weapon to be encased in a fine layer of silver, allowing them to strike against any creature that can only be hurt by silvered weapons. It lasts for a number of hours equal to the engraver's Runic Knowledge.
