# Bounding (1)

**Element:** Water

**Engraved Upon:** Any item, but frequently boots

When activated this rune summons a powerful gust of wind that propels the caster forward 30' and up to 10' in the air. The leap is in a straight line and they may still use their normal movement and fight in the same round that it is used.
