# Fever (1)

**Element:** Fire

**Engraved Upon:** Any Item, usually jewellery

Using this rune causes a high fever to affect the rune caster for one round - they are at -3 to all actions and suffer one point of STAMINA damage but the fever does purify them of any poison or disease they are suffering.
