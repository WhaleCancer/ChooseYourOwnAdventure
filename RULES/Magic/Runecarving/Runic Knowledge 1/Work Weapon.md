# Work Weapon (1)

**Element:** Air/Earth

**Engraved Upon:** Any weapon

When used your weapon improves in balance and handling - for rounds equal to your Runic Knowledge you now score a critical hit when you roll 11 or 12, your weapon is considered magical and every hit causes +1 STAMINA damage as whirls of elemental gravel assault your target.
