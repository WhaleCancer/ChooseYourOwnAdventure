# Cleanse Item (6)

**Element:** Water

**Engraved Upon:** Any cursed item

Using this magic a rune carver can attempt to cleanse a cursed item. The rune is engraved upon the item and then activated in the hope that the magic of the rune will absorb any curse that lies upon the object. At this point the carver must test against their MAGIC - Runes skill. Stronger curses will apply penalties to this test. If they are successful the curse is destroyed along with the rune. What this does to the previously cursed object is up to the Director; it may destroy it, it may leave it intact but without magic, it could even reverse the curse and turn it into a bonus.
