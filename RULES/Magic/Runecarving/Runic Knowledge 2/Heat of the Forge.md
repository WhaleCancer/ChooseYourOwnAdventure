# Heat of the Forge (2)

**Element:** Fire/Earth

**Engraved Upon:** Metal or Stone, usually a weapon

Upon activation this rune causes the item it is engraved upon, usually a weapon, to heat up as if it had just been removed from a forge. For a number of rounds equal to the engraver's Runic Knowledge the weapon does +2 points of STAMINA as heat damage each time it lands a blow (blows that are dodged or stopped by armour have not landed). It will ignite flammable materials if held against them for one round. Creatures that are susceptible to fire take double damage, creatures that are resistant to fire take no extra damage. For the duration the blade is considered magical.
