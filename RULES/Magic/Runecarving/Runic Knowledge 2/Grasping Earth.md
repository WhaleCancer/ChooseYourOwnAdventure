# Grasping Earth (2/4)

**Element:** Earth

**Engraved Upon:** Any solid surface

This rune is carved upon the ground and left; it lasts for days equal to your Runic Knowledge. It is activated when someone passes within 10' of it, at which point a thick tentacle of earth snakes out and attempts to grab the target. The tentacle has SKILL of 10 - if it hits it grabs its victim and turns back to stone! Chipping themself out will take some time, depending on the tools they have to hand. If cast with four Runic Power the rune will cover a radius of 20' and once activated will sprout tentacles to attack anyone that enters that area with two rounds of activation.
