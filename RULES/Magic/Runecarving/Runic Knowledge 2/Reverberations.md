# Reverberations (2)

**Element:** Earth/Air

**Engraved Upon:** Metal or Stone, usually Armour

Upon activation this rune begins absorbing energy. When the bearer is struck the rune absorbs one point of damage per blow until it has absorbed damage equal to the Runic Knowledge of the engraver, at which point a blast of air emanates from them. Everyone within melee range of the rune bearer must make a test against their SKILL or be dazed for one round. After activation the rune lasts a maximum of 10 minutes (60 combat rounds) before fading.
