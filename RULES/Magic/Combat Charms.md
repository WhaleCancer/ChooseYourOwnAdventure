# Combat Charms

Combat Charms magic was developed in the Kabeshian Empire before the War of the Wizards to provide spellcasters for battle. It is a fast, fluid magical style suited for melee-fighting through unique Combat Charms.

## Magical Focus

Practitioners of Combat Charms develop MAGIC Characteristic and [Magic-Combat Charms](../../Skills/MENTAL/Magic/Magic-Combat%20Charms.md) special skill. The total of MAGIC and Magic-Combat Charms is called Magical Focus.

## Using Combat Charms Magic

Combat Charms Magic spells are cast similarly to Wizardry spells, including modifiers and the "Oops! Table." No components are required, but spells are recorded in a spellbook. A practitioner of Combat Charms cannot cast traditional Wizardry or Sorcery but can learn the Minor Magic Special Skill. Combat Charms Magic is categorized into "regular spells and Combat Charms."

## Combat Charms

Combat Charms are special spells cast before combat, with instantaneous casting (short gesture or sound). Practitioners get one free Combat Charm at the start of each combat (subject to roll and modifiers), and only one can be cast per encounter.

Combat Charm effects are temporary, lasting only for the specific combat the caster is involved in, and cease once the battle ends. Some Combat Charms can be cast outside of combat, subject to usual modifiers, as indicated in their spell descriptions.
