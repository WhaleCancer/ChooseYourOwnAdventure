Demonology is a specialist type of Conjuration focused on summoning Demons. Demonologists are inherently evil in nature, and this magical tradition is not suitable for good-aligned characters. Campaigns featuring Demonologists are often "Master and Servant" types, where the Demonologist initially holds power over their Demons, but this dynamic eventually reverses.

Demonology magic involves unspeakable experiments and foul deeds and is typically associated with arch-enemies in Advanced Fighting Fantasy campaigns. Director approval is required if a Demonologist is played as a Hero, due to potential campaign disruptions and negative reactions from common people and forces of Good towards Demonology Magic.

## Special Skills

### Magic-Demonology

This is a specialist variant of Wizardry with two main effects:

1. **Access to Demonology Spells:** Provides access to specific Demonology spells (listed below).
2. **Conjuration Rituals:** Allows the casting of Conjuration rituals to summon creatures from the Demonic Plane.

This skill does not grant access to standard Wizardry spells. Demonologists can also access the following rituals from the Heroes Companion:

- Ritual of the Flaming Nightwing
- Ritual of the Unearthly Acolyte
- Ritual of the Cursed Soul
- Ritual of the Nightmare Mount
- Ritual of the Animate Mandrake
- Ritual of the Featureless Shade

**Starting Spells and Rituals:** Demonologists start with spell and ritual levels equal to their total MAGIC and Magic-Demonology scores. Ritual levels are determined by Magic-Conjuration. Like other Wizards, only spells of level 4 or below can be chosen at character creation, and only rituals of level 2 or below can be known at the start of the game.

**Summoned Creatures:** A Demonologist can have a number of summoned creatures equal to their MAGIC plus Magic-Demonology score.

### Demon Lore

This Special Skill provides knowledge about:

- Demons and Hell
- The hierarchy and "ecology" of Hell
- Special abilities of Demons
- The rituals required to summon and control specific Demon types

**Example:** Delbek the Black has MAGIC 7, Magic-Demonology 2, and Demon Lore 2. She will have 18 Magic Points and know nine levels of Demonology spells and Rituals.

## New Talents

### Demonic Respect

The character is held in great respect by most denizens of the Demonic Plane. A Demon will only attack this character if they are themselves attacked, or if commanded by magic or a Demonic Prince. Even player character Demons are bound by this respect and cannot attack the character until these conditions are met.

### Demon Senses

A character with swirling black and red eyes can see normally but also use a "life sense" to detect mortal lifeforms within twenty feet, though with a vague understanding of their nature.

### Ritual Master

Rituals performed by this character take half the normal time and receive a +2 bonus to the casting roll.

**Example:** Delbek chooses the Demonic Respect Talent and will not be attacked by Demons unless she attacks them. This is very useful if a summoned Demon breaks control.
