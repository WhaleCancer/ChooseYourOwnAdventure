## Money

In EPIC, characters move through a very specific economy: **1985 British Columbia**, where cheques bounce, ATMs are new, and most deals are still done in cash, beer, or favours. Rather than a generic “credit,” this game uses **Canadian dollars (CAD)** by default, with prices and wages roughly matching mid‑1980s values.

You can still abstract money when you do not want exact bookkeeping, but having real‑world prices helps drugs, weapons, and bribes feel grounded.

## Currency and Forms of Payment

- **Canadian dollars**: Notes in \$1, \$2, \$5, \$10, \$20, \$50, and \$100 denominations, plus coins.  
- **Cheques and bank drafts**: Common for legitimate business; slow to clear and easy to stop.  
- **ATMs and bank cards**: Emerging technology in 1985; available in cities but not everywhere.  
- **Money orders and postal orders**: Used by people who do not trust cheques.  
- **Street cash**: For drugs, guns, and most criminal deals, **paper cash in small bills** is king.  
- **Favours and leverage**: In many cases, information, blackmail, or a favour owed is worth more than any stack of twenties.

If you prefer a more abstract feel, you can treat all amounts as **“Credits”** equal in value to 1985 CAD and simply rename the unit.

## Price Scale and Quick Rules of Thumb

To keep play moving, treat prices in **four rough bands**:

- **Pocket change (under \$20)**  
  - Coffee, cigarettes, bus fares, cheap meals, bar covers, low‑stakes gambling, basic supplies.  
  - Players usually do **not** track every dollar here unless they are truly broke.

- **Everyday expenses (\$20–\$200)**  
  - Motel rooms, decent meals for a group, moderate bar tabs, taxi rides across town, basic tools, most personal‑use drugs (see `Encumbrance` table), low‑end handguns bought “no questions asked.”  
  - Track these if money is meant to be tight; otherwise, assume an investigator with steady income can cover a reasonable share.

- **Serious money (\$200–\$5,000)**  
  - Quality firearms, armoured vests, reliable used cars, small boats, larger drug buys, significant bribes to mid‑level officials or cops, medical bills, rent arrears.  
  - These costs **matter** and should force choices: guns or rent, lawyer or car, paying off a debt or buying more product.

- **Big scores (\$5,000+)**  
  - New vehicles, high‑end military weapons, major drug shipments, paying off dangerous debts, buying property, serious hush money.  
  - Treat this tier like a **story beat**: robberies, inheritances, cartel payments, and big‑case rewards.

Where a more exact price is useful (for drugs, weapons, or armour), individual entries give sample 1985 CAD values.

## Legal vs. Street Prices

Many items in EPIC have **two prices**:

- **Legal / retail price**: What a law‑abiding citizen might pay at a shop with paperwork and taxes.  
- **Illegal / street price**: What a criminal or desperate buyer pays for **speed, discretion, and availability**.

As a rule of thumb:

- Street price for restricted items (illegal guns, stolen vehicles, forged documents, serious drugs) is often **1.5–3×** the legal price, plus a risk premium in remote towns.  
- In the opposite direction, fences and shady pawnshops usually pay **10–30%** of the item’s fair value when buying loot.

The Director is encouraged to adjust prices up in isolated logging camps, coastal villages, or island towns where supply is limited and everything arrives by ferry, barge, or small plane.

## Income, Debt, and Lifestyle

Characters may have day jobs, union benefits, pensions, or simply live off grifts and hustles.

- **Low‑end wage** (dishwasher, gas‑station clerk, part‑time labour): roughly **\$4–\$6/hour**, \$700–\$1000 per month after tax.  
- **Skilled worker** (mechanic, logger, dock worker, nurse, line cook): **\$8–\$15/hour**, \$1,500–\$2,500 per month.  
- **Professional / well‑paid** (lawyer, doctor, mid‑level manager, TV reporter): higher still; money is rarely a day‑to‑day issue but big expenses still hurt.  
- **Criminal income** is spiky: long droughts punctuated by **big scores** or **devastating losses**.

You can summarise a character’s finances by **Lifestyle** instead of exact paycheques:

- **Broke**: Living paycheque to paycheque or couch‑surfing. Any purchase over \$50 hurts; debts and late fees are common.  
- **Working class**: Can handle everyday expenses and occasional splurges, but serious gear or big bribes require planning or loans.  
- **Comfortable**: Most routine costs are hand‑waved; only serious money (weapons arsenals, vehicles, major bribes) is tracked closely.  
- **Affluent / Connected**: Money rarely limits the character, but social or legal consequences of spending might.

## Bribes and Dirty Money

In a conspiracy‑ridden, X‑Files‑style B.C., money smooths the path between civilians, cops, officials, and organized crime.

- **Small bribes (\$20–\$100)**:  
  - Free drinks, bar tabs, “finder’s fees,” tips to bouncers, low‑rank clerks, or informants.  
  - Usually grant a bonus on a single **Social** or **Streetwise** test.

- **Serious bribes (\$100–\$1,000)**:  
  - Paying off patrol officers, customs staff, motel owners, or union reps to look the other way or share records.  
  - May erase minor legal trouble or open doors that would normally stay closed.

- **Dangerous bribes (\$1,000+)**:  
  - Buying off detectives, MPs, senior bureaucrats, or cartel lieutenants.  
  - Always carries risk: blackmail, sting operations, or being noticed by people higher up the food chain.

The Director should treat big bribes as **plot hooks**, not automatic success.

## Abstract Money Option

If you want the atmosphere of 1985 dollars without detailed bookkeeping, you can:

- Track only **Serious** and **Big score** expenses; assume anything less is covered by Lifestyle unless the character is explicitly broke.  
- Let players buy a **“Resource” advantage** (e.g., Contacts, Union Backing, Family Money) that can be burned once per session to cover a large expense without tracking every dollar.  
- Use **Debt** as a narrative tool: instead of paying in cash right away, characters owe favours, information, or future jobs to the people who front them money or gear.

Money, in EPIC, is not just a number; it is one more way the setting pulls the characters into debts, obligations, and the shadows between the official world and whatever is really going on in those dark forests and cold coastal waters.
