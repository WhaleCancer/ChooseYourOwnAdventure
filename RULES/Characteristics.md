# Characteristics

Every Character has a selection of Characteristics that tell you what they are capable of, what they know and are skilled at, and how much punishment they can take before they're beaten. These are represented for most Characters by the main Characteristics: PHYSICAL, MENTAL, and LUCK.

## PHYSICAL

*A Character's PHYSICAL score starts at 4. Additional points may be assigned to this Characteristic during character creation, with the maximum number of points that can be added depending on the Character's [[RULES/Grade|Grade]].*

A Character's PHYSICAL score indicates physical capabilities: strength, agility, reflexes, coordination, and endurance. The higher the PHYSICAL score, the better.

PHYSICAL is used for melee and ranged combat, athletics, physical feats, and actions requiring bodily strength or dexterity.

### STAMINA POINTS

STAMINA POINTS represent the Character's ability to take damage before being incapacitated.

**STAMINA POINTS = 2 × PHYSICAL SCORE**

## MENTAL

*A Character's MENTAL score starts at 4. Additional points may be assigned to this Characteristic during character creation, with the maximum number of points that can be added depending on the Character's [[RULES/Grade|Grade]].*

A Character's MENTAL score indicates intellectual capabilities: reasoning, perception, memory, analysis, and technical knowledge. The higher the MENTAL score, the better.

MENTAL is used for knowledge skills, awareness, technical operations, and actions requiring mental acuity.

### PSI POINTS

PSI POINTS represent the Character's ability to use psionic powers and mental abilities.

**PSI POINTS = 2 × MENTAL SCORE**

## LUCK

*A Character's LUCK starts at 8, and up to 3 points may be added to it regardless of [[RULES/Grade|Grade]].*

LUCK is a pool of points that can help your Character. It can decide fate, change the tide in battle, or save a life. LUCK is handy but be careful – it does run out.

### LUCK POINTS

LUCK POINTS represent the Character's current available luck. The Character's LUCK score determines their maximum LUCK POINTS.

**LUCK POINTS = LUCK SCORE** (at character creation)

### Testing for LUCK

A Character may be required to Test for LUCK in certain situations, or may choose to Test for LUCK to try and make a situation favorable. To Test for LUCK, the Character must roll two dice and compare the total rolled with their current LUCK POINTS. If the rolled number is equal to or less than the LUCK POINTS, the Character is Lucky and the result goes in their favor. If the rolled number is higher than the LUCK POINTS, the Character is Unlucky and the result goes against them.

Each time LUCK is used in this way, the Character must reduce their LUCK POINTS by one point, whether the result has been Lucky or Unlucky. The more LUCK is used, the riskier it becomes to use in future.

### Using LUCK in Combat

LUCK may also be used in battles at a player's own choice to increase or decrease the effects of wounds, escape from combat, negate critical hits and fumbles, and ignore movement penalties. See [[RULES/Combat|Combat Rules]] for more details on using LUCK in combat situations.

## Restoring Characteristics

### STAMINA POINTS

A Character's STAMINA POINTS will change constantly during an adventure as monsters, exhaustion and penalties take their toll. STAMINA POINTS are restored by eating Provisions. Each unit of Provisions restores 4 STAMINA POINTS. A Character's STAMINA POINTS may never exceed their Initial level.

STAMINA POINTS can also be restored to their Initial level by drinking a Potion of Strength or through medical treatment. See [[RULES/Special-Skills/Knowledge-Skills#Medicine|Medicine]] for more details.

### PSI POINTS

A Character's PSI POINTS will be depleted as they use psionic powers and mental abilities. PSI POINTS are restored naturally over time through rest and meditation. A Character's PSI POINTS may never exceed their Initial level.

PSI POINTS can also be restored to their Initial level by drinking a Potion of Mind or through special psionic artifacts. See [[RULES/Psionics|Psionics]] for more details.

### LUCK POINTS

A Character's LUCK POINTS are reduced by one point each time they Test for LUCK. LUCK POINTS can be replenished in two ways:

The Director can award Luck bonuses (usually between 1 and 3 LUCK POINTS) in situations where the Character has been particularly fortunate, such as finding a key to a treasure room or discovering an important clue.

LUCK POINTS can be restored by drinking a Potion of Fortune. This action not only restores LUCK POINTS to the Character's LUCK score but also permanently increases the LUCK score by one point. For example, if a Character's LUCK score was 9 and their LUCK POINTS had been reduced to 5, drinking a Potion of Fortune would increase the LUCK score to 10 and restore the LUCK POINTS to this new LUCK score of 10.

LUCK POINTS may never exceed the Character's LUCK score.
