# Grade

A Character's Grade represents their level of experience and capability at character creation. Characters can be created with varying levels of experience, from complete novices to highly experienced veterans. It is recommended that all Characters created at the same time use the same "power level" to ensure balanced gameplay.

The chosen Grade will affect:

- **Characteristic Points** - How many characteristic points can be allocated
- **Skill Points** - How many skill points are available
- **Talent Points** - How many talent points the Character receives
- **Starting Equipment** - What equipment and resources are available

## Grade Levels

| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------- |
| Novice    | 6                  | 1 at 2, 4 at 1      | 1       |
