**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

Spell casting, of whatever tradition, relies on channelling magical energies into appropriate effects. Some users of magic are able to keep this channel open for longer, allowing spells to possibly last longer than other magicians.

When a spell cast by a Hero with this Talent and with a duration expires, the caster can make another casting roll. This second roll does not require an action from the Hero, and nor does it require any expenditure of Magic Points or STAMINA, but if it succeeds the spell continues for another normal duration.

At the end of this second duration, the spell expires and cannot be continued.
