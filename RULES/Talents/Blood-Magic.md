# Blood Magic

**Source:** CB77028 - Magic Companion (Pages 13-16)

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

The spells of a Hero (or villain) with this Talent draw their energies in part from the blood of their victims. If the spell itself causes the target to lose 1 or more STAMINA points through any means, the spell costs 1 Magic Point or STAMINA less than usual, as a thin stream of blood seems to fly towards, and merge into the spellcaster. This is considered Evil magic by most civilised people.
