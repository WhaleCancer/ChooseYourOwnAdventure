# Weaponmaster

**Source:** Core rulebook (AF2e)

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

This Talent allows a Character to use almost any weapon without training, even those they might never have seen before! For every 3 points a Character has in their best melee Weapon special skill (rounded up), they gain an effective 1 point in every other melee weapon special skill. The Character does not actually have any points in these weapons, and other Weapon Special Skills must be developed as normal.

**Example:** A Character with 4, 5 or 6 points in the Melee Weapons Special Skill can add 2 points to their PHYSICAL when fighting with a different melee weapon. This Character will need to develop that weapon's Special Skill of 3 or more to gain any extra benefit.
