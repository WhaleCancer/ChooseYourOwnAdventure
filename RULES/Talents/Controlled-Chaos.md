# Controlled Chaos

**Source:** CB77028 - Magic Companion (Pages 13-16)

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

A Hero can only take this Talent if they have the Magic-Chaos Special Skill. If the Hero with this Talent suffers a Double result, they may (after determining the results of said breach) roll one dice, and treat that as the double on the effect table. They must accept the result of the second roll. Thus if a Chaos Mage rolled a double 5 as their casting roll, they could (instead of everyone taking damage), instead roll one dice. If this comes up as a 3, the caster would mutate instead as the result would be considered a double 3.
