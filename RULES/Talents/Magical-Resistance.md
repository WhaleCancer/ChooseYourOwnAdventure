# Magical Resistance

**Source:** Heroes Companion (Chapter 1)

**Cost:** (See Director)

Grants resistance to most lesser Magic (good or bad). A Hero with this Talent is unaffected by all 1 Magic Point or 1 STAMINA spells, as well as all Minor Magic spells. However, the downside to this Talent is that this includes beneficial spells also; the Talent cannot be switched on and off at will. Additionally, the Hero gets a +2 bonus to LUCK tests against more powerful malign magic.
