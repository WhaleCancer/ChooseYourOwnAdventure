# Mutations Table

When a Character with the [Mutant](./RULES/Talents/Mutant.md) talent is created, roll 1D3 to determine how many mutations they have, then roll on this table for each mutation.

## Rolling Mutations

Roll 2D6: the first D6 determines the category (1-6), and the second D6 determines the specific mutation within that category.

## Category 1: Physical Attacks

| D6 | Mutation | Effect |
|----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Poisonous Bite | The Character has poisonous fangs, and their bite inflicts a standard Poison as well as small bite damage. |
| 2 | Breathe Fire | Character can roll a D6 each Attack Round: a 1 or 2 means an opponent within 10' is burned for 1 STAMINA POINT damage. |
| 3 | Horns | Character has a natural melee attack using the Horn damage table. |
| 4 | Spikes | Character is covered in spines. Any unarmed attacks on the character inflict 1 STAMINA POINT damage to the attacker. Character cannot wear a sealed suit. |
| 5 | Wings | Roll D6 for type: 1-2 Bat wings, 3-4 Insect wings, 5-6 Bird wings. Character can fly at the same speed that they can walk. |
| 6 | Scaly skin | Heavily scaled skin counts as medium armour with no special skill required. |

## Category 2: Sensory and Limb Variations
