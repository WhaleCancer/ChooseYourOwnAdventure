## Notes

### Titan-Only Talents

These talents are specific to the fantasy setting and involve magic, fantasy creatures, or medieval elements:

- **Magic-Related:** All talents from the Magic Companion (Arcane Blank, Blood Magic, Controlled Chaos, Dark Energies, Draining Power, Dual Caster, Empowerment, Enchantment Master, Hedge Magician, Powerful Summons, Soul Store, Spell Mastery) and Magical Resistance
- **Fantasy-Specific:** Battle Rider (mounts), Dark Veil (demons/undead), Familiar (fantasy animals), Templar (deities)

### Stellar Adventures-Only Talents

These talents are specific to the science fiction setting:

- **Pilot/Vehicle:** Defensive Pilot, Dogfighter, Hotshot

### Universal Talents

Most talents work in both settings, including:
- Combat talents (Combat Reactions, Crack Shot, Duelist, etc.)
- Social talents (Affiliation, Reputation, Silver-Tongued, etc.)
- Physical talents (Ambidextrous, Fleet Footed, Strongarm, etc.)
- General utility talents (Jury Rigger, Learned, Technical Genius, etc.)

### 1980s Setting Talents

The 1980s paranormal setting has the following characteristics:

- **Available:** Most universal talents work in this setting (combat, social, physical, utility)
- **Available:** Pilot/vehicle talents (Defensive Pilot, Dogfighter, Hotshot) - advanced vehicles are common in this setting
- **Available (Adapted):** Familiar can be adapted for robotic or technological companions rather than fantasy animals
- **Available:** Clearsight works for seeing through illusions and paranormal deceptions
- **Not Available:** All traditional magic talents from the Magic Companion - traditional spellcasting magic is not appropriate for this setting. Psionics work differently and use different rules.
- **Not Available:** Fantasy-specific talents (Battle Rider, Templar) - these are too fantasy-specific for the 1980s setting

### Director's Discretion

The Director may allow certain setting-specific talents in other settings with appropriate modifications. For example:
- **Mutant** works in both settings but may be more common in Stellar Adventures
- **Familiar** could be adapted for robotic companions in Stellar Adventures or technological companions in the 1980s setting
- **Battle Rider** could be adapted for vehicle coordination in Stellar Adventures
- **Dark Veil** might potentially be adapted for paranormal entities in the 1980s setting, but is marked as unavailable by default
