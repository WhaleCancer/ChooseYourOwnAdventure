# Spell Mastery

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

Some users of magic have a favourite spell that they use again and again, or maybe one that they seem to really understand and are just a natural at casting. A magician of such narrow focus may choose one spell that they are currently able to cast, receiving a +2 bonus to all Magic special skill rolls for that spell. Furthermore, the caster also gains the benefit of the Attuned Talent (AFF2e p31), but only for that specific spell. Once chosen, the spell may not be changed.
