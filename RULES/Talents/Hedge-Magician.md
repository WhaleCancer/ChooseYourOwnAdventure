There are, on Titan, various spellcasters who are utterly incapable of utilising powerful magics, whilst at the same time being accomplished practitioners of cantrips. A Hero with this Talent may never learn or use any Magic special skill other than Magic-Minor. They are considered however to know all of the Minor Magic spells unless the Director specifically prohibits an individual cantrip.
