# Dark Veil

**Source:** Heroes Companion (Chapter 1)

**Cost:** 2 Talent Points

Something in the Character's background or past has shaded their soul from the sight of demons and undead spirits. If the character does not take obvious aggressive action against the demon or spirit, the foul creature will not even be able to detect the Character. Once the Character attacks the demon/spirit in whatever form, that demon will forever be able to see the Character.
