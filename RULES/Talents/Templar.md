# Templar

**Source:** Heroes Companion (Chapter 1)

**Cost:** (See Director)

This Talent requires a Hero to devote their life to a Deity like a Priest, granting one appropriate ability (see AFF p88-98). Templars don't need MAGIC characteristic points or the Magic-Priestly Special Skill, but have a Devotion score of 5. The chosen power is permanent and usable once per day. All other restrictions still apply. The Templar must still follow the edicts of his God and religion.
