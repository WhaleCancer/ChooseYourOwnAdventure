# Swashbuckler

**Source:** Core rulebook (AF2e)

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

This Talent allows an unarmoured Character to reduce the damage from attacks by dodging, ducking and weaving. It never seems to work if the Character is wearing armour or carrying a shield. The protection it provides is dependent on the Dodge Special Skill of the Character, and is detailed further in the [[RULES/Combat|Combat]] chapter.

**Note:** Some companion books suggest that the effects of this Talent could be made automatically available to all unarmoured Characters, rather than requiring the Talent to be purchased.
