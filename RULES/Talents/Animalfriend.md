# Animalfriend

**Source:** Core rulebook (AF2e)

**Cost:** 2 Talent Points

This Character is a friend to all beasts. Natural animals will not attack unless magically controlled, and wild or domestic animals will avoid or investigate and then leave. If the Character shields companions, most animals will leave the group. Starving or maddened animals might attack companions. If the Character attacks an un-magically controlled animal, the bond is broken, and the animal (and nearby animals) are free to react.
