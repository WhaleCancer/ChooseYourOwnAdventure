# Draining Power

**Source:** CB77028 - Magic Companion (Pages 13-16)

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

This Talent allows a user of magic to draw energy from their surroundings to help power their spells. This drain is indiscriminate and will take the life force of just about anyone nearby, whether they are friend or foe.

When a Hero (or indeed villain) with this Talent casts a spell, only half of the normal Magic Points are expended as shown below. The remaining power for the Spell is drawn from a random living and sentient being nearby (there is no definitive range, but normally up to 100 yards or so). The victim will lose 1 STAMINA for each point of drain, and there is no LUCK roll to avoid this effect.
