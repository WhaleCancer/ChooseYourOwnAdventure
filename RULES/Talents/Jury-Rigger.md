# Jury Rigger

**Source:** Core rulebook (AF2e)

**Cost:** 2 Talent Points

An Character with this talent is able to make just about any tool or basic mechanism given a few parts and basic tools, and can also force a damaged system to work, even if at minimum capacity. This talent is not a replacement for the engineering special skill for proper repairs or maintenance, although this talent does allow the creation of some outrageous (and short lived) inventions. Any mechanism made or repaired by this talent will work just long enough to fulfil its purpose before failing completely.
