# Clearsight

**Source:** Heroes Companion (Chapter 1)

**Cost:** 2 Talent Points

The eyes of a Character with this Talent see true, and will not be fooled by what is not really there. As a consequence, the Character will recognise most illusions for what they really are. Only illusions created directly by powerful supernatural entities will not be recognised for what they are.
