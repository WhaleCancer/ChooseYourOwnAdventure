# Resilient

**Source:** Combat Companion

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

This Character, upon reaching 0 STAMINA POINTS, continues to fight. Subsequent damage is applied to LUCK instead, with the character dying if LUCK reaches 0. STAMINA POINTS recover normally after a fight, but LUCK recovery is different. This Talent represents the Character's incredible will to survive.
