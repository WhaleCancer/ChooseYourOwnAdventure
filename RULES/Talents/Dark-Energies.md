**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

The origins of magical energies are mysterious and varied, and there is much debate as to where "Magic" comes from. Some casters seem to extract this magical energy from raw darkness, and the darker it is, the more power they are able to draw on.

If the caster is in total darkness (no light whatsoever) they gain a bonus of +1 to all spell casting attempts and also reduce the MP or STAMINA cost of the spell by 1 (minimum of 1).
