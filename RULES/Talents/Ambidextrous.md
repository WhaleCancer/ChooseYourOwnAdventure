# Ambidextrous

**Source:** Core rulebook (AF2e)

**Cost:** 2 Talent Points

A Character with this talent can use either hand just as easily for all manner of actions. The biggest impact however is in combat, where the Character can use a weapon in each hand at the same time. Both weapons must be useable in one hand, and at least one must be a dagger or shortsword. If the Character is attacking one opponent, a successful combat roll means both weapons hit. The Character will roll damage for both weapons, and the opponent will make one armour roll against the total damage. The Character cannot use a shield when fighting in this manner.

If this Character wishes to use two firearms, each of these attacks will need to be against the same opponent and will suffer a penalty of -2.
