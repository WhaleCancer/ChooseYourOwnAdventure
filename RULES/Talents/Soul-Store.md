# Soul Store

**Source:** CB77028 - Magic Companion (Pages 13-16)

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

A Hero with this Talent is able to cast a spell, but prevent it from activating immediately, instead storing it away within themselves. A successful casting roll must be made, and MP or STAMINA expended as normal (any required components are used at this stage). The Hero can store one spell in this way, releasing it at a later time with no casting roll or cost. The Hero may cast other spells whilst they have a stored spell.
