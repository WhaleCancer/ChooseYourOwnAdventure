# Familiar

**Source:** Core rulebook (AF2e)

**Cost:** 2 Talent Points

The Character gains a small, otherwise normal, animal as a familiar (common examples include crows, cats, dogs, parrots, and rats). This talent does not require the Character to be a spellcaster. The familiar is fanatically loyal, sharing an emotional and mental bond with the Character. While it has no special abilities, it is considered of normal intelligence and can follow orders. It can be used to eavesdrop (getting the gist, not specifics) or scout locations. If the familiar is lost, another will be found, though the Director may increase the time if the Character consistently loses companions.
