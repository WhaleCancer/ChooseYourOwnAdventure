# Arcane Blank

**Cost:** 4 Talent Points

A Hero with this Talent cannot learn any Magic special skill, cannot learn any Spells and is surprisingly resistant to spells of all kinds and from all sources. A Hero with existing magical abilities loses them instantly if they acquire this Talent.

If a spell would affect this Hero, either because they are the sole target, one of several targets or within an area of effect, they must roll 2d6 and compare it to their current LUCK score. (This is not a Test for LUCK and their LUCK score is not reduced by one when they do this.) If the roll is above their LUCK score, the spell works as normal. If the result is below their LUCK score, the spell fails completely. Thus a Hero with this talent caught in the area of a Fireball and rolling below their LUCK score will cause the fireball to fail and not affect anyone at all. If the Hero rolls exactly the same as their LUCK score, they are unaffected by the spell, but all other targets are affected normally.

Note that this Talent affects all spells (and spell like effects) both good and bad.
