# Talents

## Overview

In addition to the base characteristics and special skills described above, every starting Character also has a Talent that can be chosen from the following list. As with all other factors, the Director decides which Talents are available in any given setting. Other than that proviso, a player may choose any Talent they desire (and that fits with their character vision).

**Talent Points:** All Talents have a point cost that must be paid using Talent Points. Combat Talents cost 4 Talent Points. All other Talents cost 2 Talent Points. It is possible for Talents to cost anywhere from 1 to 6 Talent Points, although some specific costs have not yet been defined. The point cost for each Talent is listed in its individual entry.

Advanced talents have to deal with a specific game subsystem.
