## Genetic Engineering

EPIC’s world has not only stolen ideas from alien machines—it has also started **rewriting flesh**. In secret labs in Japan, the US, and a few other states, researchers use recovered alien tools to splice non‑human DNA into animals and humans, and to apply alien gene‑editing techniques to purely terrestrial genomes.

Officially this work is about curing disease, improving crops, and building hardier livestock. Unofficially it produces **bio‑augmented soldiers, chimera test animals, and “improved” humans** whose existence would cause riots if the public ever saw them.

Like cyberware and psionics, genetic engineering gives real power at a steep cost—physical, psychological, and spiritual.

## Rules Overview

Genetic alterations are handled as **Genetic Traits**. Each Trait:

- Provides one or more **mechanical benefits** (bonuses to Characteristics or Skills, special senses, natural weapons, etc.).  
- Carries one or more **drawbacks** (penalties, vulnerabilities, social consequences).  
- Adds **Genetic Instability points** to the character, representing how far they have been pushed from baseline.

### Genetic Instability

- Every character starts with **0 Instability**.  
- Each Genetic Trait adds **+1 to +3 Instability**, as listed.  
- At **3, 6, and 9 Instability**, the character must immediately roll on a **Genetic Side‑Effects table** (see below).  
- If Instability ever reaches **10+**, the character is on the edge of becoming something non‑human; further major changes are at the Director’s discretion and may convert the character into an NPC.

Instability can very rarely be reduced (through experimental treatments, alien artefacts, or miraculous healing), but in general it is **permanent**.

## Acquiring Genetic Traits

Genetic engineering is not something done at a street clinic. To gain a Trait, all of the following must be true:

- The campaign is in or near the **X‑Com phase**, and the Characters control or have access to a suitable lab.  
- The relevant **research project** has been completed (captured specimens, alien devices, or APEX data provide the blueprint).  
- The Character spends significant **downtime** (weeks to months) undergoing procedures and recovery.  
- The group pays the **1985 CAD cost** and accepts the Instability increase and drawbacks.

Directors should treat new Traits as **major character upgrades**, comparable to serious cyberware or top‑tier psionic abilities.

## Genetic Traits (Examples)

Below are sample Traits suitable for early campaign use. Directors can create more by following the same pattern: **one strong upside, one clear downside, Instability 1–3**.

### Enhanced Skeletal & Muscular Structure

- **Benefit**:  
  - +1 to **PHYSICAL** (or equivalent Strength/Brawn attribute).  
  - Advantage on tests to resist **knockdown, grapples, and blunt trauma**.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Slightly increased body mass; treat Encumbrance as if always carrying one extra Normal item.  
  - Medical scanners and experienced doctors will notice unusual bone density and tissue patterns.  
- **Instability**: +1  
- **Typical Cost**: \$25,000–\$40,000 (1985 CAD) plus months of recovery.

### Night‑Adapted Eyes

- **Benefit**:  
  - +2 bonus to **Awareness / Perception** tests in low light or darkness.  
  - Can see clearly in light levels where normal humans are nearly blind.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Penalty (‑1 or worse) to tests in **bright daylight without protection**; sudden flashes or flares can blind the character for a round.  
  - The irises have an unnatural sheen or shape that is obvious at close range.  
- **Instability**: +1  
- **Typical Cost**: \$18,000–\$30,000.

### Alien‑Hybrid Nervous System

- **Benefit**:  
  - Advantage on **initiative and reaction** rolls; the character may be allowed to act first among normal humans in many situations.  
  - Reduced penalties from being **stunned or shocked**.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Vulnerable to powers and devices that target **“alien bio‑signal” signatures**; certain psionic or technological attacks gain +1 damage column or +2 to hit this character.  
  - Occasional involuntary twitches, odd posture, or brief sensory glitches mark them as “off” to sensitive observers.  
- **Instability**: +2  
- **Typical Cost**: \$50,000+ and extremely rare access.

### Regenerative Matrix

- **Benefit**:  
  - The character recovers **+1 extra STAMINA per day** of normal rest, and may regain **1 STAMINA per hour** in stable conditions.  
  - Once per session, the character can attempt a Regeneration test to downgrade a serious wound to a lesser one.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Scarring and tissue growth behave strangely; wounds may heal into **ropey or patterned scars** that disturb onlookers.  
  - Certain cancers, infections, or alien pathogens may spread **faster** in this body.  
- **Instability**: +2  
- **Typical Cost**: \$60,000+ and high‑end APEX or alien biotech.

### Natural Weapons (Claws / Fangs / Bone Spurs)

- **Benefit**:  
  - Gain a built‑in melee attack that uses the **Small Knife** or **Fighting Knife** damage track (Director’s choice), without needing to draw a weapon.  
  - May be used while restrained or when metal weapons would be detected.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Hard to hide when damaged or under close observation; may make social life and legal IDs difficult.  
  - Some jurisdictions automatically treat such individuals as **dangerous mutants**, drawing police and APEX attention.  
- **Instability**: +1 or +2 depending on extremity.  
- **Typical Cost**: \$20,000–\$35,000.

### Chimera Template (Animalistic Senses and Instincts)

- **Benefit**:  
  - Choose an animal template (wolf, cat, raptor, shark, etc.). Gain **+2 to one category of perception** (smell, hearing, or similar) and a situational bonus on relevant tracking / hunting / awareness tasks.  
  - The character may also gain a minor extra—e.g., slightly improved jump distance, balance, or swimming speed.  
- **Drawbacks**:  
  - Behavioural bleed: under stress, the character may act in line with the animal template (predatory focus, territorial responses, pack loyalty, etc.). The Director may require Willpower tests to avoid these impulses.  
  - Some physical markers (eyes, teeth, posture, subtle fur patterning) make them unsettling to observant people and animals.  
- **Instability**: +2–3  
- **Typical Cost**: \$70,000+ and ethically dubious labs.

## Genetic Side‑Effects (Instability Table)

When a character’s Instability first reaches **3, 6, or 9**, roll 2D6 on the following table (or choose an appropriate result):

| 2D6 | Side‑Effect |
|-----|------------|
| 2 | **System Crash** – For the next 24 hours the character suffers ‑2 to all physical tests as their body rebels; at the end of this period, they lose 1 permanent STAMINA or 1 point from a physical characteristic (Director’s choice). |
| 3 | **Visible Mutation** – Gain an obvious physical marker (strange eyes, ridged bones, unusual skin tone). Social interactions with strangers suffer a small penalty unless concealed. |
| 4 | **Immune Quirk** – Normal diseases barely touch the character, but some drugs and medical treatments no longer work or have halved effect. |
| 5 | **Sensory Ghosts** – Occasional phantom smells, sounds, or touches from inherited alien or animal memories; mostly narrative, but may impose penalties in high‑stress scenes. |
| 6 | **Metabolic Swing** – The character needs more or less food and sleep than normal; failure to meet the new requirement imposes fatigue penalties until corrected. |
| 7 | **No Obvious Effect** – This time, the body integrates the change cleanly. No immediate side‑effect. |
| 8 | **Allergic Trigger** – The character gains a new allergy or sensitivity (common chemical, specific food, certain radiation band). Exposure imposes penalties or STAMINA loss. |
| 9 | **Psychic Echo** – The character becomes faintly visible to psionic senses; psionicists may detect them more easily, and certain alien powers gain +1 to target them. |
| 10 | **Unstable Emotion** – One emotion (anger, fear, euphoria, apathy) becomes harder to regulate; in relevant scenes the Director may call for Willpower tests to stay composed. |
| 11 | **Genetic Drift** – Over weeks or months, subtle traits continue to shift: fingerprints, scent markers, or minor facial features. This can complicate IDs and long‑term relationships. |
| 12 | **Fundamental Shift** – The character’s genome edges closer to truly alien. At the Director’s discretion this may: adjust a Characteristic by +1/‑1, alter how certain psionic or alien effects work on them, or mark them as a potential host for something from beyond. |

## Research and Faction Use

- **APEX Consortium** and a few national black projects are at the forefront of this work. Many of the Traits above exist **because of APEX experiments** on volunteers, conscripts, and unwilling subjects.  
- PCs who capture altered humans, chimera animals, or alien gene tools can unlock new Genetic Traits as **research topics**, mirroring cyberware and psionic research.  
- Some alien species encountered later in the campaign may already embody extreme versions of these rules, serving as warnings of where unchecked genetic engineering can lead.

Genetic engineering should feel like a **third path** alongside cybernetics and psionics: less obviously mechanical than cyberware, more invasive than simple training, and always raising the question of just how far from “human” the Characters are willing to drift to win.
