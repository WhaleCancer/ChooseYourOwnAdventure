# Character Creation

## Overview

Character creation in EPIC follows a step-by-step process that allows players to create Characters capable of investigating paranormal threats and surviving encounters with the unknown.

## Character Creation Steps

1. **[Background](./#Background.md)** - Choose your Character's background
2. **[Characteristics](./#Characteristics.md)** - Assign characteristic points
3. **[Skills](./#Skills.md)** - Select and assign skill points
4. **[Talents](./#Talents.md)** - Choose talents based on [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md)
5. **[Finishing Off](./#Finishing Off.md)** - Equipment, money, and final details

## Background

Each Background has a set of Skill bonuses, starting equipment, as well as an initial encounter with an unexplained phenomenon.

### Combat Focused Backgrounds

These backgrounds excel in combat, having multiple Combat oriented Skills and related starting equipment.

- The Breacher
- The Operator
- The Shield
- The Sniper

### Support Backgrounds

- The Medic
- The Priest
- The Surgeon

### Knowledge Backgrounds

- The Conspiracy Theorist
- The Geneticist

### Vehicle Focused Backgrounds

These backgrounds have a variety of Skills that usually makes them an all rounder, but they all also have a focus on operating one class of Vehicles.

- The Pilot
- The Submariner

## Characteristics

Every new Character is given the following scores in every Characteristic:

- **PHYSICAL** 4
- **MENTAL** 4
- **LUCK** 8
- **SANITY** 8

Each Character can now be tweaked to suit whatever type of character the player wishes to play. Every character receives 8 points at this stage which can be assigned according to the following rules:

- **PHYSICAL** can have up to 3 points assigned to it.
- **MENTAL** can have up to 3 points assigned to it.
- **LUCK** can have up to 3 points assigned to it.
- **SANITY** can have up to 5 points assigned to it, but each assigned point increases SANITY by 2.

**STAMINA POINTS** are automatically calculated as **2 × PHYSICAL SCORE**. For example, a Character with PHYSICAL 6 has 12 STAMINA POINTS.

Characteristics will be increased as the Character gains in experience during play.

### Grade-Based Character Creation

The number of characteristic points available at character creation varies with [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md) as shown on the table below:

| Grade     | Points |
| --------- | ------ |
| Civilian  | 2      |
| Novice    | 5      |
| Competent | 7      |
| Veteran   | 8      |
| Expert    | 9      |
| Master    | 10     |
| Champion  | 11     |

The maximum number of points that may be allocated to each characteristic at this stage also varies by [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md), with the exception of LUCK which remains at a maximum of 3 points. Remember that every point allocated to SANITY increases that characteristic by 2.

## Skills

A newly created Character of any [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md) receives the free Skill points allocated to them based on their Background.

When it comes to the skill points chosen by the player, the number chosen and the points assigned to each, the [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md) determines these and they are specified below:

|           | 4 Points | 3 Points | 2 Points | 1 Point |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| Civilian  |          |          |          | 3       |
| Novice    |          |          | 1        | 4       |
| Competent |          |          | 2        | 5       |
| Veteran   |          |          | 3        | 6       |
| Expert    |          | 1        | 4        | 5       |
| Master    |          | 2        | 5        | 4       |
| Champion  | 1        | 3        | 6        | 3       |

## Talents

A new Character receives a number of Talents determined by their [Grade](./RULES/Grade.md).

| Grade     | Talents |
| --------- | ------- |
| Civilian  | 0       |
| Novice    | 1       |

| Veteran   | 1       |
| Expert    | 2       |
| Master    | 2       |
