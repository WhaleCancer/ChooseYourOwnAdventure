# Generating a map

There are a large number of ways you can go about creating a settlement, the rules we are providing are one example that should create an interesting, playable place for you to set your adventures in. If you already have a preferred method in mind, or a map you have prepared yourself, use that instead but remember - the encounters and missions might require specific locations, so you may have to adapt to that as you play. Methods of creating a map include:

**Create a map**: Either on paper or a computer, this simple and popular method requires only your time and imagination. You can make up the size and features as you go along. For the purposes of this book cities are divided into locations which cover a number of streets, so you may wish to mark important sites (temples, keeps etc) as you go.

**Borrow a map**: With the popularity of role playing games on the rise there are a huge number of maps available online, many for free. Choose one that you like and download or print it off - you can mark in the important locations as you go.

**Use the 'Dice Drop' method**: Described in the core AFF rulebook or Blacksand as a means of creating a dungeon, the dice drop method creates a random pattern of locations which you then fill in using your imagination. A piece of paper, pencil and some dice are all that is required. Very useful when you are struggling for inspiration!

## Table 4.1.4 Map Creation Summary using the 'dice drop' method

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Decide what sort of settlement you want to create - city, town or village and read the pages of this book describing them and giving clues as to the origin and reason for the settlement. |
| 2 | Get a piece of paper, some dice and a pen or pencil; the paper should be of decent size - A4 or larger - unless your handwriting is very tiny. |
| 3 | Roll or drop a die onto the paper, and mark its place. As you do so, write in or mark locations using table 4.1.5 'List of Settlement Locations' making sure that you have at least one of each type of location needed for your settlement - table 4.1.5 shows the recommended number for different locations in cities, towns or villages. |
| 4 | Keep rolling dice and adding more locations until your settlement reaches the size you want it to - guidelines are provided for each type. So a city may end up with several temples, but a village will not. Villages and towns have a maximum number of locations, but a city can be as large as you would like it to be. The bigger the better! |
| 5 | At an appropriate place, mark a spot for the docks or custom house. Clearly it depends on whether or not you want your settlement to contain a body of water (river, lake, seafront). If it does you should put down a docks, if not place a custom's house at some point near the edge of your settlement. |
| 6 | Using your imagination draw a settlement boundary such as a wall or hedge (including gates if this is a city) and a river or other body of water if it is appropriate for the terrain. You may also want to leave some parts of your map as blank (unexplored) so that you can add more locations later. |
| 7 | Go around each location (temple, inn, theatre etc) and mark its boundaries; it's best to do this lightly at first in case of mistakes - your settlement should end up looking like tiling; the size of each location should roughly align with its type - a park should fill up more space than an inn. These 'tiles' will allow you to move around the settlement, so take care with this step. There should be no gaps left between tiles, unless your settlement contains a feature such as a river or pit. |
| 8 | Give your settlement a name! Once that is done, you can start to use the settlement conditions and rumours section to see what is happening here. |
