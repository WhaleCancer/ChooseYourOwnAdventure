# Unlawful Actions

Unlawful Actions
Although most Characteres try to behave decently, it is possible to play as a brute that achieves their aims whilst also terrorising the locals. To that end, nearly all NPC’s have their characteristics listed, meaning you can attack them if you wish to. It’s important to note three things:
• If you are going to attack them, you must decide
this at the start of the encounter. You cannot use their dialogue options if you decide to fight them.
• Once the combat has been resolved, you must
check to see if attacking them was an unlawful action (it will be stated alongside their characteristics). If it was, you now need to roll on the Lawbreaker table to see what happens to you.
• If you are playing a mission or campaign, you
can still obtain information from them, it is assumed you are intimidating them into speaking.
• Most civilians (unless stated otherwise in their
description) will attempt to flee after the first round of combat. If they get away, you still get to roll for their treasure (if any) and still have to roll on the Lawbreaker table.
On a world like Titan there isn’t a formalised police system but instead every place will have its own arrangements, usually dependent on how much effort the local nobility put into organising security. A good, kind Lord might employ a regiment of trained footmen to carry out regular patrols; a poor or careless one might simply sweep the jails for thugs who can be paid in bounties and beer. In general, most of the law enforcement is done by the peasants.
They will be told that when the constable or sheriff calls upon them all those who are able must take up arms and help. Overall, if you a8ract the a8ention of the ‘The Watch’ you don’t know if you are going to be caught by a mob of peasants, a well armed group of soldiers or basically ignored.
Can I fight The Watch?
The short answer is no. You have to accept the result of the roll - if you get a bad result it is assumed that enough Watchmen or militia have turned up to subdue even the strongest Characteres. There are however some ways you can influence the result, but these carry the risk of making things worse.
• Test your LUCK: If successful, add 4 to your roll.
If unsuccessful, deduct 2.
• A8empt to talk your way out of it: Make a test
against your Con Skill or Law Skill.
If you succeed, add 2 to your roll, if unsuccessful, deduct 2.
• Flee! Before making the roll, you take the most
direct route possible out of your settlement (deal with encounters as required) and leave. For every day you sleep rough outside the city, add 1 to your roll, but remember you need rations and must roll on the rough sleeping encounter table each night.

## Table 4.1.30 Lawbreaker Table

2d6 What happens to you 2
The Watch has had more than enough of your antics. You are jumped by a full squad armed with nets

and mancatchers, tied up, beaten soundly and chucked in the dungeons for a week. The jailers pop in

occasionally to give you a kick and a thump and the only food you get is mouldy bread and slops. You

are reduced to 3 STAMINA points. When they boot you out all your equipment apart from your

backpack, one weapon (or spellbook) and 2d6 Gold Pieces has been ‘confiscated’. When you complain

about this, it’s pointed out to you that only the intervention of those you have helped before saved you

from the gallows.  Disturbing the peace has consequences, as you now more clearly understand.
3
Guess what? Nightsticks can be daysticks too! Dispensing with due process, you are first ne8ed and then given a hard beating accompanied by many surprisingly inventive insults. If you weren’t busy screaming in pain you might have enjoyed them. Your STAMINA is reduced to 4 points and your equipment is grabbed before the Watch, with a final kick to the kidneys, leaves you lying in a heap. Go through your bags. For each item, roll 1d6. If the result is an odd number, the Watch has taken it. Reduce your total gold by 10d6 gold pieces to a minimum of one.
4
A large squad of Watchmen appear from the crowds and grab you. You are ‘escorted’ to the jail - that is your new starting location. A long and tedious interrogation, accompanied by some minor roughing up

follows before you are chucked in the cells overnight. You are released the next day, but your STAMINA is reduced to 5 and your belongings have been picked over. For each item in your inventory, roll 1d6 - on a 1 or 2 it has been taken and 6d6 gold pieces were ‘lost’, apparently. Start your new day accordingly.
5
You think you have go8en away with it, when suddenly it’s lights out as you are expertly coshed from behind. Lose 2 points of STAMINA (to a minimum of 2, the blow is not fatal). When you wake up you

have been deposited outside the city wall, in the surrounding slums. Test against your LUCK. If you fail, you have been robbed - this means you lose 5d6 gold pieces and must roll for each item in your inventory
- on a roll of 1 (on 1d6) it has been taken. Start your fresh new day at the city gate. If you succeed on your
LUCK roll, the Watch has simply taken 3d6 gold pieces as a fine, but you still start your new day outside the city.
6
You’ve been a very naughty boy, haven’t you? Someone has snitched about your location and a gang of
Watchmen take the opportunity to pile on and subdue you. This is not done kindly and your STAMINA is reduced to 5. You are dragged to the jail and locked up overnight in a crowded cell. Test against your

LUCK - if you fail you have contracted a nasty disease that will have you vomiting for a week - you can

only gain 1 point of STAMINA per day from eating during this time. You are fined 6d6 gold pieces and

let out the following morning. Start your new day from the Jail location.
7
A squad of Watchmen has been looking for you for some time and are very upset by the time they find

you. You are grabbed and pummelled - reduce your STAMINA to 6 points - whilst some of them go

through your belongings. Lose 4d6 gold.
8
The Watch jumps you and before you can fight back, claps you in irons. You are dragged off to spend the afternoon and evening in the stocks, where you are pelted with rotten fruit, vegetables and the occasional decaying rat. Lose 2 points of STAMINA To a minimum of 2). Your next Leadership Skill roll is at
-2 and your Etiquette Skill rolls are at -2 until you reach an inn or tavern and have a bath.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 87 9
You are confronted by the Watch and a large number of crossbows pointed at you convince you to

surrender. You are frogmarched to the jail (this is your new location) and spend the rest of the day

‘negotiating’ with a captain, whilst other Watchmen are sent out to check up on you. You are let off with a fine of 4d6 gold pieces, but rumours of your skullduggery have been spread far and wide. Your next

three Social skill rolls are at a penalty of -3. At the end of the day you are released from the jail and must make your way through the city at nigh8ime. Adjust encounters accordingly.
10
A group of guardsmen have been alerted to your whereabouts and confront you on the street. They are

heavily armed and armoured, and the hisses and boos you hear from passersby make it clear they have

the support of the peasants. You decide to be nice and concede to their demands, which in this case is

only a fine - deduct 3d6 gold pieces from your total.
11
The Watch has apprehended you! Also, the Watch are exceedingly drunk! You can’t really work out what they are celebrating, but they are certainly taking the need to celebrate it very seriously. You quickly

realise that you can get away with your crimes rather easily on this occasion. A round of drinks sets you back 1 gold piece, after which it is agreed that everything was a big misunderstanding. On your way!
12
Your heart sinks as you see the Watch approaching at a trot but soars again a moment later as you

recognise the lead woman. She’s an old friend from back home, you never expected to run into her here.
She recognises you too and is delighted to see you again. The problems you’ve caused are quickly

forgotten as you both agree to meet up for a drink sometime. Move along to your next encounter with a

broad grin on your face.
Call for the Watch!
If you are in the City and not in a catacomb (or other location where the Watchmen fear to tread) you may try to call out for help. It is worth noting that
Watchmen in general are highly skilled at turning a blind eye to trouble that doesn’t involve them. If you cry out for help, make a test against your Leadership skill roll with a penalty of -3. In addition, look at the rules for your location - if there are modifiers to the
Lawbreaker table roll, you also apply these to your
Leadership roll. So if you call for the Watch whilst in the Slum Alley, your leadership roll has an additional
-3 penalty, for a total penalty of -6! However, if you
try to a8ract the a8ention of the Watch whilst at the
Keep, you get a bonus of +4, for a total modifier of +1.
If you do a8ract the a8ention of a helpful Watchman, they will come as a gang - they impose a -2 penalty on the SKILL of your enemy as they step in to fight beside you. The Watch do not fight for free though - they will take any treasure and items that are recovered from the enemy. It’s best not to argue about this!
Call for Aid!
From time to time Characteres might come across people they can convince to join their cause. This will be described in the text as ‘So-and-so says you may call upon their aid’. The Character may ask this person to fight alongside them, usually for one encounter only (as described in the text). The Character will have to make the combat rolls for them according to the standard rules and they will mimic the Character - if the Character flees, they flee too.
Important note: This feature is intended to provide some assistance to the Characteres, not allow them to build up an army of followers! You should only have one of each type of person available to help you - so if you have already met a peasant today and persuaded them to help you, no more will be persuaded to help you until you have used their services.

Stealing and thievery
Whilst not very Characteric, some players may want to try their hand at larceny and the criminal life. There are two possible ways to go about this - using Sleight of
Hand or Disguise and Con Skills. (This is separate from the brute force method of attacking them with a weapon!)
Sleight of Hand - pickpocketing.
Should you wish to pickpocket your way around
Titan, the following rules apply. Firstly, this can only be used in a social encounter - you can’t pickpocket a goblin that is trying to stab you. Secondly, if you choose this option it replaces other dialogue options.
You can’t attempt to pickpocket someone and then stand around having a chat with them, even if you are successful.
To make an attempt, you should use an opposed
SKILL test as detailed in the core rulebook. For the civilian their Awareness = their SKILL + 2. So if you tried to pickpocket an Acolyte, you would test your
Sleight of Hand skill against their Awareness of 5+2 = 7, using the ‘contested skill test’ rules. A critical failure on your part (rolling double one) or a critical success by them (rolling double six) means you have failed, no ma8er what your skill levels are!
Should you succeed, you have made off with 1d6 gold pieces, completely unnoticed by your victim.
Should you fail, they have noticed your knavery and will proceed to loudly cry ‘thief! thief!’ in an attempt to rouse the watch. You must test your LUCK. If successful you get away before the guards arrive - move your Character to an adjacent map location. If you fail, the watch has arrived and you must roll on the
Lawbreaker table to see what happens to you.
Disguise and Con - the scam
In this scenario, you have decided to extort or con people into handing their money over. First of all you must create a disguise, which costs you 1gp in materials for every day that you use it. Dressed up as perhaps a tax collector or tithe taker, you are now ready for your scam. As with pickpocketing, you may only attempt this on social encounters. You cannot scam/pickpocket the same target and if you attempt to scam someone, you cannot use their other options.
Firstly, make a Disguise skill roll - if you fail, they realise something is ‘off’ about you and leave before you can even start your pa8er. Next make a Con roll but with a -3 penalty as you are trying to get them to hand over money. If you succeed, they are convinced and hand over 1d6 gold pieces, and you may move on. If you fail, they have seen through this charade and will tell you to leave them alone. Once this happens, news gets around and it will not be possible to attempt it again for one week. If you critically fail your Con roll they are sure this is criminal and cry
‘Watch! Watch!” Roll on the Lawbreaker table.
Other restrictions
Clearly you must be sensible regarding your choice of victims. Trying to pickpocket a drunken dwarf is fine, trying to pickpocket or scam a leper is just unreasonable. Only one scam or pickpocket attempt may be made per location per day.
The fast moving world of Titan
As you move around your location, you should end up with various bonuses or penalties to skills such as Bargain or Etiquette, which reflect your understanding of the layout of this place and the lives of its people. However, Titan is a fast moving and unpredictable world and the people's memories are short when it comes to showering them with praise or holding grudges. Should you leave a location for a day or more, you lose all these bonuses and penalties and start again with a fresh slate.
