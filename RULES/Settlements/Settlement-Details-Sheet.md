## Settlement Details Sheet’. Exactly

how much you want to write down is up to you, it will probably depend on how often you want to return to a particular settlement.

Finishing Off
When you have created your map, you should feel free to customise it as you see fit. If, for example, you have ended up with the garbage heap next to some wealthy streets, you could swap some locations around until you have a map that you are happy with or add additional locations. If you want your city to be a renowned home for scholars, you could use the dice drop method to add another college or two. If you want it to be a highly religious city, add more temples. You should keep tinkering with the map until you have a settlement that you feel happy with and remember to feel free to leave some parts of the map blank in case you wish to add more locations at a later date.
What about individual Streets?
In this book we have taken the approach of dividing settlements into locations, which are essentially the important buildings, districts or landmarks of that city, town or village. This creates a workable map with a variety of settings for your adventures - each location has its own character. We have not provided details of individual street layouts. Even a small city could have several hundred streets and this level of detail is not required to run or play games. For most interactions, the exact shape of the street is not relevant, though of course you may wish to create some maps of streets that you use regularly, or to have some battle maps to hand.
What does ma8er is what is going on in the streets, alleys, avenues and boulevards of your settlement - this is covered by the encounters tables for each location and by the guidance on street fighting given at the end of this section.
Encounters in a Settlement
Having created a working map, it is now time to venture into the city and start to meet its people. As you enter each location you should look it up in the
‘Locations’ section, to discover what you are going to meet there. For each type of location is given a description, any special rules and an encounter table that provides a broad selection of people and incidents that your Characteres can interact with. You should make a roll on the table when you enter a new location or when you spend a long time- several hours at least - in one place.
The encounters are described in sections 4.2 ‘Settlement Social Encounters’,

## ‘Settlement

Challenge Encounters’ and 4.4 ‘Settlement Map Encounters’.
These encounters do not represent all the things that you see and meet; there will be peasants going about their work, small shops and workshops, traders moving goods about and the general hustle and bustle of a busy settlement. The encounters are simply the most interesting or relevant things you come across.
If you are using this book as a resource to help run adventures you can of course ignore the encounter tables and put in whatever people or places you would like to see. As usual, the Game Master should have final say.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 55 Types of encounter
Encounters are all divided into three broad categories: Social, Challenge or Map.
• Social encounters - See section ‘4.2 Settlement
Social Encounters’: Although combat may be an option, these encounters are primarily based on using your social skills (Etiquette, Leadership,
Bargain, Con) but other rolls may be involved.
One important aspect of social encounters is that the people you meet have a Social Rank which can affect the skill rolls you make as part of the encounter. In the encounter tables they are marked with an ‘S’, so the ‘Soldier’ encounter is S44.
• Challenge encounters - See section ‘4.3
Settlement Challenge Encounters’: Often combat based but may also involve using some of your other Skills in order to survive. You might need to leap across a chasm or avoid some other type of danger. You do not, generally, make social skill tests in these encounters.  In the encounter tables they are marked with an ‘C’, so the ‘Ghoul’ encounter is C8.
• Map encounters - See section ‘4.4 Settlement
Map Encounters’: These encounters add some additional detail about your location and allow you to build up a complicated city with numerous features, adding places you can interact with such as a Weaponsmith or Stables. You should make a note of these as you find them in case you wish to return there later on.  In the encounter tables they are marked with an ‘M’, so the ‘Armourer’ encounter is M13.
Number of Encounters each day
The number of encounters you have each day is difficult to gauge; too many and you can be overwhelmed by simply moving around the settlement, too few and it feels empty and boring.
It is suggested that you make a maximum of three encounter rolls per day for any single location - one for the morning, one for the afternoon and one for the night. This will keep your settlement busy but not be overwhelming.
The encounter tables for each location are different and are designed to represent the type of people and problems you might run into - the area around a temple should have a different feel to it than the garbage heap.
Most of the encounters do not have a set duration and it will be largely up to you, the Character, to decide how long they take and therefore how many encounters you can have during a day. Some will be longer than others; saving a burning building could take several hours, chatting to a peasant might only take minutes.
However, it is worth bearing in mind that the actual encounters are merely highlights of your day. You are also finding your way around a teeming city, trying to investigate strange goings on, stopping to rest and eat from time to time and generally having to cope with all that life throws at you.
Avoiding Encounters
Sometimes, you might want to avoid encounters, either because you are injured or perhaps you just want to move quickly about the city. You can do this by making a test against either the Sneaking or City
Lore Skills. If you are Sneaking, you are trying to slip past the crowds without a8racting a8ention. If you use City Lore, you are trying to remember a shortcut or quiet back alley that can take you through.

If you have to stay in a specific location for some time
(a mission requires you to watch a location for a number of hours for example) the skill test should be made with a -3 penalty as it is difficult to go unnoticed for this long.
If you succeed with your test you can ignore one of the encounters you roll for this location. You must decide if you are going to do this before you roll on the encounter table.
Increasing Encounters
It may be that you want to have additional encounters at a specific location, maybe as part of a mission or quest. In that case you may make a skill test against one of Etiquette (asking around),
Awareness or City Lore (searching). Looking for encounters means spending some time at a location, possibly just standing around waiting for something to happen. As a rule of thumb you can try this twice during the day (once for the morning, once for the afternoon) and once at night, when settlements are generally quieter.
Optional Rule: The ‘Quiet City’
The encounter system is designed to give your settlements a lively, bustling feel - places where you are having to shoulder your way through the crowd just to make headway and you never know what may be around the next corner. However, some people might prefer to move around more freely, so the ‘Quiet City’ option can be used. If your Character is simply travelling through a location en route to somewhere else, roll encounters but ignore ‘social’ and ‘challenge’ encounters. Keep making a note of
‘map’ encounters as this helps build up your city for future use.
Example: Initiate Zadi Kellist is in Ludria and has spent the night in ‘The Thresher’ (TA2 on the map) and now wants to move over to the ‘Paupers Pit’ as part of her current quest.
Looking at the map of Ludria she decides on a route she will take - through WS2 (The Silver Streets) to the docks, DO, then take the ferry across to ST3 (The Hill) and then into
GY2. Zadi is not trying to avoid encounters so we make a roll to see what she meets in each location. In WS2 a roll on the Wealthy Streets is a 7 so she meets a Toady (S7) and discovers a map encounter which turns out to be a
Bathhouse (M27). She ignores the Toady and carries onto the Docks, where (with a roll of 11 on the table) she meets a Group of Traders (S5).
Zadi decides to spend some time talking to them, buying a round of drinks and in return ge3ing some useful information. She takes the ferry (1gp fee) over to ST3, a
Streets location but decides to try and avoid an encounter by making a test of her City Lore skill. She rolls a 7 which would usually be a failure, but the +2 bonus she received from talking to the Group of Traders means she succeeds, so she slips unnoticed through this location. Arriving at the Graveyard she rolls a 15 and meets the Funeral Cortege
(C4) encounter! This could be a tough fight for our initiate, but hopefully she makes it through.
As you can see, this approach to moving around the city makes it a lively and occasionally dangerous place. If this is too much for you, consider using the
‘quiet city’ optional rule to speed things up.
Nigh=ime and Resting
As night falls, most people will return to their homes and lock up for the night. Torches and candles cost money and there is no street lighting on Titan! Once you have completed what you feel to be enough encounters for one day, you will need to find a place to bed down and sleep. You can do this at an inn, tavern or drinking den - see the prices listed for those locations - or you can sleep rough, by trying to find an

Chapter 4 - Settlements 57 abandoned shack or quiet nook to rest in. Clearly, sleeping outdoors in a teeming city has its own risks that you should be aware of. If you choose to take the risk, choose odds or evens then roll a 1d6 - if you correctly predict the outcome of the roll, your judgement about where to sleep was good and you get a full night's rest. If you are wrong, your sleep has been disturbed and you must roll for an encounter. If this encounter is dangerous, your opponents receive
+4 to their combat rolls and +2 to their damage rolls on the first round as you awake from your slumber.

What is outside my settlement?
For a town or village, when you leave the area of your map you should use the rules for wilderness travel - the area just outside of a settlement is likely to be farmed land, but could be any type of environment appropriate to the land you are adventuring in.
For a city, the area immediately outside the city should be treated as either Slum Alleys (1-5 on 1d6) or Garbage Heap (6 on 1d6) locations. This is because many of the poorer people, unable to afford lodgings within the city, will build dwellings close to the city wall in the hope that they can flee inside when troubles come - which they always do. You should break this area into a reasonable number of separate parts, based on the size of your city (this prevents
Characteres from taking a shortcut outside the city by going out of one gate, around and back in another gate).  Further beyond this shanty town will be farmland or wilderness - use the rules provided in the wilderness section.
Finding a random location in your settlement
Many of the missions require you to pick a location in your city at random. There are two methods for doing this. The usual method is to drop or roll a dice onto your map and see where it ends up - if it goes off the map, roll it again. The location you want is the one under the dice, if it se8les on a boundary line then use your judgement to decide where you are going.
The second method is to use the ‘Random Location’ numbers on the locations table - roll a 1d6 twice and refer to the numbers in that column - a roll of 3 followed by a 2 would be the Hospital. A roll of 5 followed by a 4 would need to be rerolled as there is no 5.4 on the list. For locations with more than one appearance (inn’s for example) either roll again or use your judgement to decide which one is most appropriate.
Location Descriptions/Encounter Tables
For each of the different locations within a settlement, a brief description is given including any special rules that relate to that type of place and the random encounter tables are provided to bring it to life.
Temple
A large heavily decorated building catches your eye.
Stone steps lead from the street up to a set of wooden double doors which are open and there are people coming in and out. Looking more closely you see that there are religious symbols marked on the walls and you guess that it is a temple of some kind. Given the number and variety of gods on Titan, it is not clear if this temple is dedicated to one particular power, or several of them as is often the case. It is not unusual to find a temple to Usrel that also has a small chapel dedicated to Libra or a garden reserved for followers of Glantanka. It looks as if the temple is unguarded and welcoming to strangers, If you want to you can enter and investigate further. Whilst the temple is the

most interesting building in this area, it is also surrounded by houses, accommodation for priests and novices, and places for pilgrims and visiting worshippers to eat and stay.
Chapter 7, ‘Political Systems & Religions’ covers the generation of a random morality and religion for each settlement or region. If you have not decided which god or gods are worshipped in this settlement, use
Table 7.1.2 ‘Religious Inclination of the Settlement or
Region’ and Table 7.1.3 ‘List of the Gods’ to determine what the religion and gods are, or you can simply assign it as a temple of ‘good’, ‘neutral’ or
‘evil’ as fits your campaign.
If your Character is a priest of the same religion as the temple, they should automatically succeed in the
Religion Lore rolls needed to use the services here, though they will be refused aid if they go to a temple that is of a different alignment (priests dedicated to the gods of good will not be helped at neutral or evil temples and so on).
If you have chosen an alignment for your Character -
Good, Neutral, Evil they should automatically succeed in the Religion Lore rolls needed to use the services when they visit a temple that has the same alignment, but also be refused these services at temples of different alignment.
Special: You may ask for healing here, though the priests are not always available. Make a 5gp donation and make a Religion Lore roll with a +3 bonus. If you succeed, a priest heals you for 3 points of STAMINA, you may only do this once per day.
Special: If afflicted by disease, you may try and find a priest to heal you here. Pay a 10gp donation and then make a Religion Lore roll with a +3 bonus. If you succeed, a priest takes pity on you and cures your disease. If you fail, they accept the donation and promise to pray for you.
Special: You may find a place to pray at the Temple.
Make a Religion Lore roll with a +3 bonus to find a suitable spot. If you succeed, you can spend some time in worship - roll 1d6. If you roll a 5, restore on point of STAMINA, if you roll a 6 the gods smile on you and restore one point of LUCK. You may only receive this benefit once per week.
Special: If your Character wants to learn the Priestly
Magic, they can do so at a temple. In addition to spending the experience points, the Character will need to attend the temple every day for a week, spending the entire day praying (this will effectively stop them from carrying out missions at this time) and they will need to purchase 5gp worth of incense each day, to burn whilst they beseech their god to grant them powers. At the end of this period of worship the Character can spend their experience points to raise their
Priestly Magic skill from zero to one.

Garbage Heap
Congratulations, you have found the town dump! In truth, your nose had alerted you to its presence some time before you saw it, but now here it is in all its rat infested glory.  The alley you were passing down has become a rutted mud track, carved up by the numerous small carts of the rag-and-bone men who use this trash heap daily. The dump itself is a fenced off area that was perhaps at some time a quarry or natural sinkhole and is now filled to the brim (and then some) with all manner of rubbish.  Fat, vicious looking rats scurry to and fro around the pile whilst some miserable looking peasants, large baskets strapped to their backs, can be seen picking their way through the detritus in search of something to sell.
Off to one side you can see a tumbledown single room shack, in front of which sits a crusty old dwarf who is, you guess, the owner or guard of the dump.
He is si8ing in a broken old chair and is fast asleep, snoring loudly, with a tankard on the ground next to him.
The most notable feature of this area is the large pile of rubbish and discarded things but there are also some rundown shacks and other decaying buildings
- this whole part of the settlement seems to be se8ling
back into the dirt.
Special: The Watch rarely bothers coming here. If you commit an unlawful action, add +3 to your roll on the Lawbreaker table.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 61 Slum Alleys
Cobblestones have given way to mud and straw and well ordered buildings are replaced by lean-to shacks and precariously designed houses where rotting timbers surround patched and hole ridden boards.
A miasma of mould and refuse hangs thick in the air and the people you see scurry past with hunger worn into their pinched faces. A group of soot faced children stare at you and as you look back, you can see they are playing a game with what appears to be a couple of dead rats.
You have passed into the slums. There is life and opportunity here, but also danger, so beware.
Special: The Watch rarely bothers coming here. If you commit an unlawful action, add +3 to your roll on the Lawbreaker table.

Wealthy Streets
The houses here are large and well maintained; many of them have walled gardens from which trees and vines poke out or shady courtyards to sit and take refreshment. The street is similarly ordered and the cobblestones have been recently swept. There is even a raised pavement on one side and some sort of gu8ering to carry away the inevitable waste left by people and horses. You can hear the sounds of life from inside the houses but there are few people out on the street itself and most of them seem to be servants of one sort or another, hurrying to complete their chores. Occasionally a noble rides past, but they pay no a8ention to some scruffy looking mercenary such as you.
In addition to fine houses there are a number of well maintained buildings and spaces in this location, such as restaurants and clubs - the sort that don’t want any scruffy Characteres leaving mud on the upholstery.
Special: The Watch is encouraged to patrol here frequently. If you commit an unlawful action, you have a penalty of -2 to your roll on the Lawbreaker table.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 63 Streets
A row of houses either side of a paved way presents itself to you. Looking along you can see a variety of dwellings; Mostly timber frame houses with second stories that hang out over the street and threaten to crash into each other - in places you could pass something from hand to hand through the upper windows. There are some stone buildings too and occasionally a small herb garden or pigsty breaks up the line and you can see that at the back of the row there are narrow alleyways weaving between gardens, outhouses and other smaller constructions.
The streets consist of a partially cobbled track with mud and plank walkways either side of it. People, riders and carts jostle to make their way along it, whilst avoiding the worst of the muck and nightsoil that inevitably builds up at the edges. The smells of fires and cooking come from a variety of sources and the sounds of busy everyday life are all around you.
The Streets are not just the place to find the houses of the common people - here you will find workshops, small warehouses and other buildings needed for everyday life.

Jail
A sullen and dismal air pervades this neighbourhood at the centre of which squats a large stone building, surrounded by high stone walls - the jail. Even the sunlight seems to dim as you approach it, your wanderings disturbing a crow in its feasting on a dead rat, making it flap up past your face caw-cawing angrily. The few people that you see are downcast and move quickly past, avoiding conversation. Of the building itself you can see mostly the walls and the imposing gatehouse which has two sombre guards on duty. They eye you suspiciously, it is clear that you should only approach if you have official business. The other buildings and houses in this vicinity have all left a gap between themselves and the jail wall, probably to stop prisoners from attempting an escape, but it gives the impression that even the stones and timbers are afraid of what lies amidst them. As you consider your next move you fancy that you can hear wailing and the ra8ling of chains coming from inside.
Whilst the Jail is the most important building hereabouts, there are also houses, a watchhouse and some rather depressing drinking dens and taverns.
Special: The Watch are constantly bringing poor unfortunates to and from the jail, so if you commit an
Unlawful Action here your roll on the Lawbreaker table has a -2 penalty.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 65 Inn
A large well maintained building stands before you.
It has a stone ground floor with a timber frame second storey, atop which a thatched roof reaches down to half-cover the upper, currently shuttered, windows. There is a large wooden door which stands open and welcoming, next to which you can see the trapdoor entrance for what must be a cellar. To the side of the building there is an arched wooden entrance to a cobbled stableyard, where you can see a horse being brushed down and fed. Above the door hangs a sign; the emblem of a black eagle on a white background. As you stand for a moment and consider your options you can hear the sound of cha8er and the clink of cutlery on plates; a wonderful smell of beer and fresh cooked food wafts across the road towards you.
The Inn is not the only building in this area; there are other places to eat and drink, houses and small shops and workshops here, but this large and well appointed Inn is the most important and notable establishment.
Special: You can stop and rest at an Inn, single rooms are 4gp a night, a meal is 3gp and stabling is 3gp a night.

Tavern
Occupying a large corner house at the intersection of two streets, you see a tavern. A sign painted on a wooden board proclaims it to be the ‘Rose & Crown’ and someone has indeed attempted to paint both those objects in gaudy colours below the name. There are two doorways, both open, and outside on the street a couple of benches are pushed up against the wall. Both are occupied by labourers of some kind who are supping their ales and generally enjoying a moment's rest from their work. The tavern has two storeys and as you get closer you can see that the bo8om level is taken up by two bar rooms, each with its own fireplace, whilst the top level (from what you can see through the windows) seems to be a sleeping room divided up with cloth screens. In general this seems like a decent place to get some food and rest.
The Tavern is not the only building in this area; it is in fact simply the largest building in a row consisting of houses, small shops and workshops. However, most people know this area by reference to this tavern which has become a local landmark.
Special: You can stop and rest at a Tavern, single rooms are 3gp a night, a meal is 2gp and stabling is 2gp a night.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 67 Drinking Den
You are passing a nondescript building when you notice the doorway is open. As you come close a strong stench of beer, pipe smoke and stale sweat assails you and you hear the sound of laughter and out of tune singing. Looking more carefully you see there is a painted wooden board nailed to the timbers above the doorway depicting a severed hand, dripping blood onto three barrels. There is no writing. Inside, the first floor of this building has been turned into a single long room with a fire at one end and a bar at the other. Straw and dirt covers the floor, cheap looking wooden benches and stools are arranged haphazardly about the place and a number of labourers are slumped in their chairs slurping down their ale. A large bald headed man with extraordinarily bushy red sideburns is carrying two handfuls of freshly filled tankards over to one group.
He is singing lustily and in the firelight his face takes on a demonic aspect - are you tempted to step inside?
It looks like a good place for a cheap meal and a drink, but you doubt that trouble is hard to come by either.  Whilst the Drinking Den is the most noticeable part of this area there are also poor houses, ramshackle warehouses, bawdy houses etc.
Special: Make sure to pick a suitably horrible name for this location when you create it. Something along the lines of ‘The Hanged Rat’ or ‘The Bag of Brains’.
Special: You can stop and rest at a Drinking Den, single rooms are 1gp a night, a meal is 1gp and stabling is 1gp a night. If you do stay the night roll 1d6. On a result of 1, you lose a random item from your inventory.

Graveyard
A chill runs down your spine and the air seems to cool as you come to a low stone wall surrounding a dreary graveyard. A few stunted trees grow here and there and moss and creepers have worked their way across each stone marker, which are placed close together like rotten teeth in a giant’s jawbone. A solitary crow looks up at you before hopping away to resume its search for juicy corpse fed worms. Further along the wall there is a covered wooden gateway, carved with symbols of death, through which you may enter if you dare - the dead do not always sleep soundly.
The Graveyard dominates this area, but there are also a few houses and other everyday buildings do8ed around its edge.
Special: The Watch are as superstitious as anyone else. If you have to roll on the Lawbreaker table, add
+3 to the result in this location as they are unwilling to enter.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 69 Docks (or Customs House)
A sturdy palisade, interrupted by towers and a gate, surrounds this area set aside for the arrival and departure of trade goods. The taxes paid on these is the reason for the barrier - for the nobility, controlling that supply of gold is a major means of income and so it is taken very seriously indeed. This is a city within the city, with its own Watch and set of laws. Guards in uniforms look down on you from the towers and although you are allowed to enter, you know you will be asked about your purpose. The hassle could be worth it though - there is a great buzz and scurry of people bartering their wares, negotiating contracts and looking for work as porters or security.
Special: Hauling goods is thirsty work. Roll 1d6 and place a tavern (1) or drinking den (2-3) next to the docks as an additional map location.
Special: If you have decided that your city is near a river, lake or sea, this location is the docks and you will see from the outside the rows of masts and sail of the ships crowding the quays inside. Groups of sailors come to and fro and the sound of sea shanties can be heard day and night. If your city is not near to a large body of water, this is a customs house and yard, where the trade caravans come through a separate city gate and you will see dust coated wagon handlers moving about in great numbers.
Special: The security of trade is taken seriously. If you have to roll on the Lawbreaker table here, take a
-2 penalty.
Special: If this is a Docks, you can hire a ferryman to take you to any location in the settlement that is also next to the water. The fee is 1gp.

College
The area you are passing through is quieter and more refined than most of the city. There are no stalls and the usual throng of townsfolk has diminished significantly. The streets here are cobbled with gu8ered pavements and the occasional tree has been to provide shade. Pausing for a moment you take a careful look around and spy a bearded scholar making his way followed by several bored looking students each carrying books. As they pass, you hear the scholar explaining some obscure ma8er of local history. From the look on his students' faces, it is clear that he finds the subject much more fascinating than they do. It seems as if you have wandered into a college of some sort. A small precinct, created by the priests of Hamaskis, in which the learned men and women of this city can impart their precious jewels of knowledge to the select few that can afford to spend their time learning rather than toiling. It is not a natural environment for adventurers but it is a place where you might find out information that is useful.
Special: It’s not illegal for you to be here without some form of enrollment or academic purpose, but you are not entirely welcome either. You have a -1 penalty to all social skills whilst here, unless you have a MENTAL skill of at least 3 (Sorcery, Wizardry or
Priestly) or at least 3 points in one ‘Lore’ skill.
Special: You may pay to use a library whilst here. For 5gp you can access a library for a day, gaining +1 to an appropriate Lore skill test. For 15gp you can hire a researcher for a day and gain a +2 bonus to an appropriate Lore skill test.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 71 Hospital
The  everyday sounds of normal life are mingled with the pitiful moans of the sick and dying as you come past this long building, which is set back from the path at the other side of a muddy courtyard that is itself crowded with small shacks.
It may once have been impressive but it has not been well maintained and you can see it is dirty and worn, with vines creeping up the side and broken shutters across the windows. Above the doorway there is a carved relief showing a hooded skeletal figure with a scythe in one hand and an hourglass in the other.
As you watch you see a man pulling a laden handcart away from one of the courtyard buildings; the contents of the cart are mostly hidden but you can see a bare arm and hand flopping lifelessly out the back.
As the carter passes you, you instinctively pull your cloak up over your mouth and nose - the stench of decay is unmistakable.
Moving into the building are two robed acolytes, followers of Usrel most likely - they tend to the ill and dying as part of their devotions. By now you have grasped that this must be an infirmary or hospital. It could have been set up as an act of charity from the local nobles or from collections in the temples, but either way it looks as if its income is meagre now and the chance of healing is slim. The Hospital is the most important building in this locale, but it is surrounded by houses and workshops of many kinds.
Special: Many cities in Titan have a place where the sick and dying are sent for care. Calling it a hospital is an exaggeration in most cases. Li8le in the way of healing is offered and disease is rife. Each time you have an encounter at this location you must roll 1d6.
On a 1 you must test your LUCK or catch a disease - roll on table 4.3.2 ‘Diseases’ to see what you have contracted!
Special: If you have been unfortunate enough to catch a disease, you can try to find healing at the hospital. Firstly make an Etiquette or Bargain skill roll to see if you can find someone willing to help. If successful you can pay 5gp for a ‘cure’ - a vial of foul smelling liquid that is brewed up by an apothecary.
Once you drink it roll a 1d6. On a 2-6 you are cured, but on a 1 some mistake has been made in the preparation and your disease will now last an additional day. No refunds!
Special: You can try to find healing at the hospital.
Make an Etiquette or Bargain skill roll to see if you can find someone willing to help. If successful you can pay 5gp for the a8ention of a ‘doctor’ who will apply an ointment and bandages. Roll 1d6 - on a 5-6 the treatment restores 1d3 points of STAMINA, but on a 1 you suffer a reaction to the salve and lose one point of STAMINA.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 73 Marketplace
Even before you got to the broad yard filled with stalls, you had been struggling past the crowds of carters, porters and street-hawkers that filled the streets. The shouts of trading, smells from the food stalls and the goods piled high amounts to a sensory overload that leaves you stunned. Gathering yourself you press on and look around to see if there is anything of interest to you. The market is set up in a large area at the confluence of many streets. Around it there are houses and shops, and most have some form of stall or display at the front. Inside are kiosks, stalls, barrows and even carpets with goods laid out on them, arranged by the simple rule of seeing how much you can squeeze into the space available whilst still leaving paths for customers to walk down.
Traders guard their wares and shout out the prices of their stock in well practised calls. Children tug at your clothing, asking you to come see what their parents have to have for sale as Watchmen move through the crowd looking out for pick-pockets. You see piles of vegetables on carts, chickens in cages, yards of cloth laid out and many other things besides.
Special: At the Marketplace it is assumed that you are able to buy any of the standard goods listed in the
AFF rulebook and to sell any goods you no longer require. Remember to make your Bargain skill tests
(assume that the traders have Bargain 7). Trading like this does not count as an encounter, but should be expected to take some time as you haggle over prices.
Special: The marketplace is so crowded that just by wandering it, you can overhear a lot. If you wish to, spend an hour eavesdropping and you can roll once on table 8.7 ‘Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events’.

City Gate (Wall)
You’ve seen it looming on the skyline for some time now, so it’s no surprise when you turn a corner and find yourself staring at the base of the city wall.
Looking up you can see the edge of the battlements and can hear the tramping of the guards boots as they make their endless circuits. Passing along a small alley past some lean-to shacks you find yourself approaching a gate house. It is a formidable structure
- the equal of any castle tower, with an inner and
outer gate protected by guards that use their halberds to poke and prod at the carts rolling by. Occasionally they stop someone and pull them over for a closer inspection, but they don’t look too interested in the job, mostly doing it to keep happy the captain that is sat on a chair at the door of the guardhouse, a tankard resting on his belly.
Whilst the City Gate dominates this part of the settlement, it is also surrounded by houses, workshops and small places to eat and drink.
Special: With so many guards about, if you take an
Unlawful Action at this location, you must take a penalty of -3 for your roll on the Lawbreaker table.
Special: The Gate is shut at night. If you approach this location at night, you cannot pass through the gate.
Special: A tariff is occasionally charged on gate traffic. Roll a 1d6. On a 1, you must pay 2gp to pass through the gate. If you don’t have the gold, you are turned back.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 75 Park
You have come across a wooded hillside, too steep or broken for building houses, that has been walled off and left as a semi-wild place within the city. Peering in through the gate, you can see a path heading off into the trees before splitting up into numerous trails.
As the ground slopes up ahead of you it allows you to glimpse some other features. You can see the head and shoulders of a statue peeking out in one place and there appears to be an open grassy area where some sort of vigorous game is being played - from the sound of it, a crowd has gathered to watch and cheer on the teams.
As you pause here and decide if you should go in or not, you can see a number of people, alone or in small groups, are strolling through the park and enjoying the scenery though you also note a couple of destitute peasants huddled in their rags under the shade of a tree, begging for alms from the wanderers. It might be a nice place to stop and rest, if you have the time.
Whilst most of the land within the city walls is filled with closely packed buildings of one sort or another, some land has been set aside as a place to relax and take a moment to sit or walk in relative peace. It might once have been a nobles garden, made open to the public as an act of generosity or perhaps the grounds of a temple that have been set aside for contemplation.
This doesn’t mean it is always peaceful - various denizens may creep in and make their home here and hawkers visit to sell their wares before they get moved on. With no businesses to protect, the Watch do not often patrol here which can make it less of a place of peace and more of a centre for illicit activity, especially at night when the gates may be locked but the walls are still easy to climb.
Special: The Watch doesn't get paid to patrol here often, if you roll on the Lawbreaker table add +2 to the result.
Special: If you need to, you can sleep rough here and it is a little bit safer than doing so on the street. To do so you will need to succeed in a Climb skill roll (to find a way in after dark). If you fail the roll you haven’t found a way in and must sleep somewhere else. If you do sleep in the park, roll a 1d6 and choose high or low - if you choose high, you only get an encounter on a 1 or 2. If you choose low you only get an encounter on a 5 or 6. Use the usual sleeping rough encounter table if you have chosen a bad spot to rest.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 77 Keep
The narrow streets open up ahead of you into a wide courtyard, at the far side of which stands the forbidding bulk of the keep. A large building of neatly cut grey stone, it has an outer wall with crenellated battlements, a watchtower at each corner and a single main gate large enough to accommodate wagons or, more importantly, a squad of soldiers.
The doors of the gate are currently open and you can see past the guardsmen to the inner courtyard and the keep itself - a severe looking block of thick stone pierced by narrow windows and recessed heavy oak doors. Unsurprisingly there is a lot of activity here - at the inner courtyard you can see a wagoneer unloading barrels with the help of some uniformed servants, atop the outer wall there are guards on lookout, resting their crossbows against the tops of the battlements. At the main gate there are more guards and a small knot of soldiers and traders haggling over something or other whilst a squad of recruits practises a combat drill in the outer courtyard, watched over by a grey haired instructor.
The clang of sword on shield is punctuated only by his words of advice to the young menof the garrison.
Around the edge of this area, a little back from the keep, life carries on as normal with peasants and servants hurrying about their business and even a couple of hawkers trying to interest the soldiers in a pie or an ale. Although not as busy as the marketplace, this is still a hub of activity.
Special: It is inadvisable to break the law here - if you do so, take a -4 penalty to the Lawbreaker roll.

Theatre
‘Come Ladies and Gentleman, Gentlemen and
Ladies, come hither and see the delights - acrobat’s that spin and leap, bards with voices sweet as nightingales, mummers with stories old and new - all this and more await you!’ The gleeman, dressed in a patchwerk of coloured cloth, jesters boots of green leather ringed with tiny brass bells and a tall floppy hat decorated with a multitude of feathers and fake gemstones, leads you onwards to a large brightly painted building. Festooned with gaily coloured statues and dyed cloth banners that flap in the breeze, signs proclaim (in several languages) the opportunity to enjoy the delights of the theatre all for the price of a few coppers. The Theatre stands several storeys high, broad wooden steps lead up to several wide doorways which are flanked by ticket booths guarded by hulking sour-faced bouncers that deter those who try to slip in without payment. From each floor light streams out of coloured glass in the shape of the masks of tragedy, comedy, glory, disaster and all the other touchpoints of drama. A crowd mills around at the entrance and in the street ticket-sellers move amongst them, drumming up an audience of the next performance.
Around and about the Theatre there are other smaller venues and entertainments as this area is rich with nightlife, though there are also houses both rich and poor. This is one of the most varied locations in the settlement.
Special: You may indeed visit the Theatre, which is ready to take your coin both day and night. For 2sp you can spend a few hours enjoying a number of acts
- singers, dancers, acrobats, comedians and so on
make their way across the stage. Drinks and food can be bought here too, Ale (or similar) for 3sp and a hot meal for 2gp. For a more refined performance you can watch a play (1gp) or even spend a night at the opera
(5gp and you are expected to be clean and well dressed).
Special: If your city is particularly barbaric or cruel, you might want to replace the theatre location with an arena for gladiatorial combat. If your city is not the sort of place that would have a permanent theatre, you can leave this location as an open area such as a square, plaza or park that could be used as a place to hold circuses or events.

Catacombs Entrance
Many of the cities of Titan are very old and over the span of centuries people have often simply built on top of older structures rather than bother clearing them away. In addition, there are sewers, dungeons, covered over streams, crypts, caves and all manner of cellars, tunnels and delvings. Sometimes these underground spaces join up to create a hidden city under the feet of the unknowing surface dwellers.
Collectively these places are known as catacombs, where all manner of dark and sinister activities take place. Most of the time the people block up or seal the entrances to these dangerous places, but sometimes a natural collapse, or something digging out from inside the catacomb, opens them up again. Having discovered a way into a catacomb you may now, if you wish, venture inside and explore it.
Generating a Catacomb
A catacomb is essentially a mini dungeon and you should read ‘Chapter 5. Dungeon Creation &
Encounters’ to see what options are available to you, but the intention of a catacomb is to make a small structure containing 3+1d6 rooms - just one dungeon section. After clearing all these rooms you can test against your Underground Lore skill to discover more and if you succeed you find a way to access another 1d6 rooms (maybe you find a collapsing wall or a concealed tunnel that leads deeper into the caves and so on). You can keep trying to discover more areas, but each subsequent test of Underground Lore has a penalty of -3, then -6 and so on.
If you wish to explore the catacomb, you have two choices. You can use the detailed options provided in
Chapter 5 ‘Dungeon Creation & Encounters’ or, if you do not want to create a separate map, you can treat it as a series of rooms with ‘abbreviated’ dungeon creation rules. Simply assume that each room is connected to the next in a fairly obvious manner and use the following tables to find out what each contains. Roll 1d6 on each table for each room and proceed as far as you dare!
Roll once on Table 4.1.25  Catacomb Origin, Table
4.1.26 Catacomb Condition and Table 4.1.27 Creature
Condition to find out what sort of environment you are entering and what modifiers you need to be aware of. As you move to each room, roll on Table 4.1.28 Catacomb Encounters to see what it contains.
This is a very shortened version of the more extensive rules given in Chapter 5.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 81

## Table 4.1.25 Catacomb Origin. Roll once for the whole catacomb.

1d6 Origin

Monsters (if encountered, see encounters table below)*.
1
Cellars - This was once a cellar or basement of a great house that has
1 - C19 Ravenous Slime,
been long abandoned and fallen into disrepair. The environment was
2 - C25 Skeleton,
built for people but it is also li8ered with the rubbish and detritus,
3-4 - C9 Giant Rat
such as broken bits of furniture, that got shoved down here before
5-6 - C20 Giant Spider
it was forgotten.
2
Cave - You have stumbled into part of a natural cave system, which
1 - C20 Giant Spider
has been built over as the city grew. The tunnels and rooms are

2 - C25 Skeleton
unworked and there are places where you have to squeeze through
3-4 - C21 Troglodytes
narrow gaps to move forward.

5 - C24 Grannits
6 - C17 Ratman
3
Lair - this place has been excavated by some creature or group of
1 - C21 Troglodytes
creatures as its home. Looking at the huge claw marks on the walls,
2 - C24 Grannits
you can’t help wondering if they are still about...

3-4 - C9 Giant Rat
5-6 - C20 Giant Spider
4
Sewer - This was once part of the sewerage system and for all you
1 - C19 Ravenous Slime
know, it might still be connected in places. A nasty miasma fills the
2 - C20 Giant Spider
air and the squeaking of rats can be heard in the darkness. The

3-4 - C9 Giant Rat
floor is a mixture of mud and slime - remember to clean your boots later. 5-6 - C17 Ratman 5
Dungeon - these rooms and corridors were constructed as part of a
1 - C8 Ghoul
larger building, almost certainly for the purpose of imprisoning people.  2 - C25 Skeleton
The rooms are small and rough with the rusted remains of chains
3- C9 Giant Rat
decorating the walls.

4 - C26 Orc Raider
5-6 - C10 Goblin Infiltrator
6
Crypt - this was once a religious place used to house the remains of
1 - C9 Giant Rat
the dead. Tomb raiders have visited and the once carefully organised
2- C20 Giant Spider
tombs have been broken into and pillaged. As you step forward you
3-4 - C8 Ghoul
can feel bones crunching underfoot.

5-6 - C25 Skeleton
*For a more extensive variety of monsters, use the encounter tables in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy core rulebook or
bestiaries such as Out of the Pit or Return to the Pit, or refer to the appropriate dungeon level encounters from Chapter 5 ‘Dungeon Creation & Encounters’.

## Table 4.1.26 Catacomb Condition.

1d6 Condition 1
Crumbling - this place is falling apart! Bits of stone and masonry are peeling off the walls and ceilings

and your stomping around is only making things worse. Every round of combat you must roll a 1d6. On a result of one, a piece of the ceiling has dislodged and is falling on you. You must make a test against

SKILL with a +2 bonus or suffer one point of STAMINA damage.
2
Slimy - Moisture hangs heavy in the air, condensation dripping from the walls and ceiling and leaving

fetid pools filled with foul smelling slime on every floor. Each time you are struck in combat you must

make a SKILL roll with a +2 bonus or slip on the muck and find yourself prone (-4 to combat until you

spend a round getting up).
3
Unholy - at some point this place was the site of a temple of evil and traces of that time linger on. If you

use magic to heal yourself you will heal one less point of stamina than normal.
4
Infernal - strange heat courses through the floor and walls in this area and pools of bubbling hot water

have to be stepped around carefully. If you are in combat, roll a 2d6 each round - on a roll of a 2 a blast

of steam has vented from a nearby crack in the masonry and you suffer 2 points of STAMINA damage.

On the good side, once you have dealt with the encounters in this area you can bathe in a warm pool.
5
Well lit - Most Catacombs are near pitch black dark, but in this case a strange fungus covers the walls

and ceilings, giving off a weird purple glow. You don’t need torches here but Sneak skill has a -1 penalty.
6
Consecrated - This area is located at a site that was once a temple of a benevolent god. If you use any

healing magic in here, you gain an additional +1 STAMINA points in recovery.

## Table 4.1.27 Creature Conditions.

1d6 Creature Modifiers 1
Well-fed - The creatures of this place have been particularly well supplied with food recently - some

unlucky adventurers perhaps - and you must add +1 STAMINA to each creature you encounter 2
Noisy - Creatures here are particularly noisy and unsubtle - you may add +1 to your Awareness Special

Skill rolls whilst in this dungeon.
3
Starving - The creatures of this area are running low on supplies and are starving. You may reduce the

STAMINA of every creature by 1 point.
4
Plagued - a foul stench fills the air down here and you cough and splu8er on bitter spores that seem to

fill the air. The creatures you encounter are plagued and after any combat you must roll 1d6. On a roll of
1 you can have been infected - roll on table 4.3.2 ‘Diseases’.
5
Infested - The sound of scuttling claws is nearly constant here. Any encounter in this area comes with an additional Grannit - which you have to deal with.
6
Riches - The monsters of this place have had particularly good luck with their raiding and delving. Every creature you defeat has an additional 1d6 pieces of gold in its hoard.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 83

## Table 4.1.28 Catacomb Encounters. For more variety, refer to the tables and advice given in Chapter 5.

1d6
Roll once as you enter each room.
1
This area is empty - you investigate carefully, but there is neither treasure, trap nor monster to be found.
The quiet here is unse8ling and you have no desire to stay longer.
2
Trapped - roll on the Devious Trap (M16)  - to move through this area. There are no monsters here.
3-4
Monster - roll on the table above to see what is lurking down here in the darkness 5
Monster + Trap - roll on the table to see what you meet and in addition you must roll on the Devious Trap
(M16). You must deal with the trap before you proceed to the fight.
6
Monster and Treasure - in addition to meeting something you need to fight, you have found a hoard of treasure - you must defeat the encounter before you get to loot the hoard (see the Forgo8en Stash Map

encounter M21).
Example: Skurl Glintscale has found a catacombs entrance in one of the ‘streets’ locations in Ludria. In this case part of a house has collapsed, revealing a narrow entrance into a chamber that lies below street level. Deciding that we don’t want to create a complete dungeon, we use the abbreviated rules to make a few rooms to explore.
Firstly we roll to see how big the catacomb is - a roll of 3 means we have 6 rooms to explore. Next we roll for its origin and another 3 tells us that this is a lair - excavated by some animal, though they may not live here anymore.
Next we roll to see what condition our lair is in. A 5 indicates that it is well lit, with a luminous fungus providing sufficient light that a torch is not needed. The next step is to check the creature's condition and a roll of 4 means they are ‘plagued’, which means we will have to check for disease after each fight. Yuck.
With that done we can proceed to explore room by room.
Each time we roll on the Catacomb Encounters table to see what we are faced with - an empty room, a trap, or a monster. Skurl can explore the whole catacomb or retreat after dealing with a few rooms. If he does clear every room he can make a test of his Underground Lore skill to try and find a further 1d6 rooms to explore.
Whatever we decide to do, we should make a note of where the entrance is but bear in mind that it will only exist for 1d6+3 days.
Special: Catacombs do not have a separate encounter table. The encounters will be inside, should you venture there. In addition, The Watch never enters the Catacombs, so no encounters here will require you to roll on the Lawbreaker table.
Special: The general citizenry do not like leaving open an entrance to a dangerous underground world near to their house or business. A Catacombs entrance should be marked on your map, but should be removed after 1d6+3 days - at some point the locals get together and board it up or fill it in with rubble.
Make this roll when you find the entrance and make a note of when to remove it.
Settlement Specific Rules
There are some things that apply to adventuring within a settlement but not to dungeons or the wilds, mostly down to interactions with ‘the Watch’ or whatever local law enforcement exists in the city, town or village. These rules are intended to cover those interactions.
Fighting in the Streets
Some encounters and missions require you to fight in the streets (or taverns) of Titan; you might be wondering how the ‘street environment’ affects these combats. As an optional rule, you can roll on the following table to see if there are any other factors to consider.

## Table 4.1.29 Street Factors

2d6 Factor 2
The Watch appear and they are not happy with this fighting. They swarm you and your opponent,

dragging you apart and stopping the fight. Make a test of your Law skill - if you succeed they let you go after ten minutes interrogation, if you fail they drag you to the Jail location where you must spend the

night, though you get all your gear back in the morning.
3
The mob turns on you - other people nearby decide you are a troublemaker and pelt you with

improvised weapons. You have to fight with -1 to all skill tests as you dodge the barrage of muck.
4
Mud & Muck - the street is slippery with mud from a recent storm or rotting food and waste (you don’t

have time to check which) - any tests of Acrobatics, Running, Climbing or Jumping have a -2 penalty here as you slip and slide.
5
Small - the street is small and cramped, you cannot use a missile weapon here and Sneaking is at -3.
6
As combat begins, someone throws a bucket of nightsoil from a window above you; test your Dodge skill or get hit. If you do get covered with indescribable muck you have -3 to your combat rolls for the first

two rounds as you cough and splu8er. Later on, you may want to take a bath.
7
The streets are quiet..the fight proceeds as normal and without interruption.
8
A group of drinkers stumble out of a nearby establishment and watch with interest. If you make a test of your Leadership skill some will come and help you, giving you +1 to your Combat skill rolls.
9
Unusual Layout - this street has an odd shape, you can use it to your advantage getting +3 once to one skill roll from Sneaking,
Awareness or combat. If you use a ranged weapon you can shoot twice before your foe reaches you.
10
The crowd goes wild! Other people on the streets see you are in trouble and decide to help, pelting your opponent with items such as cabbages, bricks etc. Each round they dish out one point of damage to your foe.
11
You spot some rickety crates in a perfect location; you can hide behind them (+3
Sneaking) or you can climb on them to gain +2 to your combat roll by having the higher ground, but if you fumble an attack  the crates break and you fall to the floor, leaving you prone for one round.
12
A passing adventurer pitches in to help you.
She has SKILL 8 STAMINA 12 Weapon: Mace
Armour: Shield and Chain Hauberk - she fights alongside you until this combat is over, then hurries off to pursue her own quests.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 85 Unlawful Actions
Although most Characteres try to behave decently, it is possible to play as a brute that achieves their aims whilst also terrorising the locals. To that end, nearly all NPC’s have their characteristics listed, meaning you can attack them if you wish to. It’s important to note three things:
• If you are going to attack them, you must decide
this at the start of the encounter. You cannot use their dialogue options if you decide to fight them.
• Once the combat has been resolved, you must
check to see if attacking them was an unlawful action (it will be stated alongside their characteristics). If it was, you now need to roll on the Lawbreaker table to see what happens to you.
• If you are playing a mission or campaign, you
can still obtain information from them, it is assumed you are intimidating them into speaking.
• Most civilians (unless stated otherwise in their
description) will attempt to flee after the first round of combat. If they get away, you still get to roll for their treasure (if any) and still have to roll on the Lawbreaker table.
On a world like Titan there isn’t a formalised police system but instead every place will have its own arrangements, usually dependent on how much effort the local nobility put into organising security. A good, kind Lord might employ a regiment of trained footmen to carry out regular patrols; a poor or careless one might simply sweep the jails for thugs who can be paid in bounties and beer. In general, most of the law enforcement is done by the peasants.
They will be told that when the constable or sheriff calls upon them all those who are able must take up arms and help. Overall, if you a8ract the a8ention of the ‘The Watch’ you don’t know if you are going to be caught by a mob of peasants, a well armed group of soldiers or basically ignored.
Can I fight The Watch?
The short answer is no. You have to accept the result of the roll - if you get a bad result it is assumed that enough Watchmen or militia have turned up to subdue even the strongest Characteres. There are however some ways you can influence the result, but these carry the risk of making things worse.
• Test your LUCK: If successful, add 4 to your roll.
If unsuccessful, deduct 2.
• A8empt to talk your way out of it: Make a test
against your Con Skill or Law Skill.
If you succeed, add 2 to your roll, if unsuccessful, deduct 2.
• Flee! Before making the roll, you take the most
direct route possible out of your settlement (deal with encounters as required) and leave. For every day you sleep rough outside the city, add 1 to your roll, but remember you need rations and must roll on the rough sleeping encounter table each night.

## Table 4.1.30 Lawbreaker Table

2d6 What happens to you 2
The Watch has had more than enough of your antics. You are jumped by a full squad armed with nets

and mancatchers, tied up, beaten soundly and chucked in the dungeons for a week. The jailers pop in

occasionally to give you a kick and a thump and the only food you get is mouldy bread and slops. You

are reduced to 3 STAMINA points. When they boot you out all your equipment apart from your

backpack, one weapon (or spellbook) and 2d6 Gold Pieces has been ‘confiscated’. When you complain

about this, it’s pointed out to you that only the intervention of those you have helped before saved you

from the gallows.  Disturbing the peace has consequences, as you now more clearly understand.
3
Guess what? Nightsticks can be daysticks too! Dispensing with due process, you are first ne8ed and then given a hard beating accompanied by many surprisingly inventive insults. If you weren’t busy screaming in pain you might have enjoyed them. Your STAMINA is reduced to 4 points and your equipment is grabbed before the Watch, with a final kick to the kidneys, leaves you lying in a heap. Go through your bags. For each item, roll 1d6. If the result is an odd number, the Watch has taken it. Reduce your total gold by 10d6 gold pieces to a minimum of one.
4
A large squad of Watchmen appear from the crowds and grab you. You are ‘escorted’ to the jail - that is your new starting location. A long and tedious interrogation, accompanied by some minor roughing up

follows before you are chucked in the cells overnight. You are released the next day, but your STAMINA is reduced to 5 and your belongings have been picked over. For each item in your inventory, roll 1d6 - on a 1 or 2 it has been taken and 6d6 gold pieces were ‘lost’, apparently. Start your new day accordingly.
5
You think you have go8en away with it, when suddenly it’s lights out as you are expertly coshed from behind. Lose 2 points of STAMINA (to a minimum of 2, the blow is not fatal). When you wake up you

have been deposited outside the city wall, in the surrounding slums. Test against your LUCK. If you fail, you have been robbed - this means you lose 5d6 gold pieces and must roll for each item in your inventory
- on a roll of 1 (on 1d6) it has been taken. Start your fresh new day at the city gate. If you succeed on your
LUCK roll, the Watch has simply taken 3d6 gold pieces as a fine, but you still start your new day outside the city.
6
You’ve been a very naughty boy, haven’t you? Someone has snitched about your location and a gang of
Watchmen take the opportunity to pile on and subdue you. This is not done kindly and your STAMINA is reduced to 5. You are dragged to the jail and locked up overnight in a crowded cell. Test against your

LUCK - if you fail you have contracted a nasty disease that will have you vomiting for a week - you can

only gain 1 point of STAMINA per day from eating during this time. You are fined 6d6 gold pieces and

let out the following morning. Start your new day from the Jail location.
7
A squad of Watchmen has been looking for you for some time and are very upset by the time they find

you. You are grabbed and pummelled - reduce your STAMINA to 6 points - whilst some of them go

through your belongings. Lose 4d6 gold.
8
The Watch jumps you and before you can fight back, claps you in irons. You are dragged off to spend the afternoon and evening in the stocks, where you are pelted with rotten fruit, vegetables and the occasional decaying rat. Lose 2 points of STAMINA To a minimum of 2). Your next Leadership Skill roll is at
-2 and your Etiquette Skill rolls are at -2 until you reach an inn or tavern and have a bath.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 87 9
You are confronted by the Watch and a large number of crossbows pointed at you convince you to

surrender. You are frogmarched to the jail (this is your new location) and spend the rest of the day

‘negotiating’ with a captain, whilst other Watchmen are sent out to check up on you. You are let off with a fine of 4d6 gold pieces, but rumours of your skullduggery have been spread far and wide. Your next

three Social skill rolls are at a penalty of -3. At the end of the day you are released from the jail and must make your way through the city at nigh8ime. Adjust encounters accordingly.
10
A group of guardsmen have been alerted to your whereabouts and confront you on the street. They are

heavily armed and armoured, and the hisses and boos you hear from passersby make it clear they have

the support of the peasants. You decide to be nice and concede to their demands, which in this case is

only a fine - deduct 3d6 gold pieces from your total.
11
The Watch has apprehended you! Also, the Watch are exceedingly drunk! You can’t really work out what they are celebrating, but they are certainly taking the need to celebrate it very seriously. You quickly

realise that you can get away with your crimes rather easily on this occasion. A round of drinks sets you back 1 gold piece, after which it is agreed that everything was a big misunderstanding. On your way!
12
Your heart sinks as you see the Watch approaching at a trot but soars again a moment later as you

recognise the lead woman. She’s an old friend from back home, you never expected to run into her here.
She recognises you too and is delighted to see you again. The problems you’ve caused are quickly

forgotten as you both agree to meet up for a drink sometime. Move along to your next encounter with a

broad grin on your face.
Call for the Watch!
If you are in the City and not in a catacomb (or other location where the Watchmen fear to tread) you may try to call out for help. It is worth noting that
Watchmen in general are highly skilled at turning a blind eye to trouble that doesn’t involve them. If you cry out for help, make a test against your Leadership skill roll with a penalty of -3. In addition, look at the rules for your location - if there are modifiers to the
Lawbreaker table roll, you also apply these to your
Leadership roll. So if you call for the Watch whilst in the Slum Alley, your leadership roll has an additional
-3 penalty, for a total penalty of -6! However, if you
try to a8ract the a8ention of the Watch whilst at the
Keep, you get a bonus of +4, for a total modifier of +1.
If you do a8ract the a8ention of a helpful Watchman, they will come as a gang - they impose a -2 penalty on the SKILL of your enemy as they step in to fight beside you. The Watch do not fight for free though - they will take any treasure and items that are recovered from the enemy. It’s best not to argue about this!
Call for Aid!
From time to time Characteres might come across people they can convince to join their cause. This will be described in the text as ‘So-and-so says you may call upon their aid’. The Character may ask this person to fight alongside them, usually for one encounter only (as described in the text). The Character will have to make the combat rolls for them according to the standard rules and they will mimic the Character - if the Character flees, they flee too.
Important note: This feature is intended to provide some assistance to the Characteres, not allow them to build up an army of followers! You should only have one of each type of person available to help you - so if you have already met a peasant today and persuaded them to help you, no more will be persuaded to help you until you have used their services.

Stealing and thievery
Whilst not very Characteric, some players may want to try their hand at larceny and the criminal life. There are two possible ways to go about this - using Sleight of
Hand or Disguise and Con Skills. (This is separate from the brute force method of attacking them with a weapon!)
Sleight of Hand - pickpocketing.
Should you wish to pickpocket your way around
Titan, the following rules apply. Firstly, this can only be used in a social encounter - you can’t pickpocket a goblin that is trying to stab you. Secondly, if you choose this option it replaces other dialogue options.
You can’t attempt to pickpocket someone and then stand around having a chat with them, even if you are successful.
To make an attempt, you should use an opposed
SKILL test as detailed in the core rulebook. For the civilian their Awareness = their SKILL + 2. So if you tried to pickpocket an Acolyte, you would test your
Sleight of Hand skill against their Awareness of 5+2 = 7, using the ‘contested skill test’ rules. A critical failure on your part (rolling double one) or a critical success by them (rolling double six) means you have failed, no ma8er what your skill levels are!
Should you succeed, you have made off with 1d6 gold pieces, completely unnoticed by your victim.
Should you fail, they have noticed your knavery and will proceed to loudly cry ‘thief! thief!’ in an attempt to rouse the watch. You must test your LUCK. If successful you get away before the guards arrive - move your Character to an adjacent map location. If you fail, the watch has arrived and you must roll on the
Lawbreaker table to see what happens to you.
Disguise and Con - the scam
In this scenario, you have decided to extort or con people into handing their money over. First of all you must create a disguise, which costs you 1gp in materials for every day that you use it. Dressed up as perhaps a tax collector or tithe taker, you are now ready for your scam. As with pickpocketing, you may only attempt this on social encounters. You cannot scam/pickpocket the same target and if you attempt to scam someone, you cannot use their other options.
Firstly, make a Disguise skill roll - if you fail, they realise something is ‘off’ about you and leave before you can even start your pa8er. Next make a Con roll but with a -3 penalty as you are trying to get them to hand over money. If you succeed, they are convinced and hand over 1d6 gold pieces, and you may move on. If you fail, they have seen through this charade and will tell you to leave them alone. Once this happens, news gets around and it will not be possible to attempt it again for one week. If you critically fail your Con roll they are sure this is criminal and cry
‘Watch! Watch!” Roll on the Lawbreaker table.
Other restrictions
Clearly you must be sensible regarding your choice of victims. Trying to pickpocket a drunken dwarf is fine, trying to pickpocket or scam a leper is just unreasonable. Only one scam or pickpocket attempt may be made per location per day.
The fast moving world of Titan
As you move around your location, you should end up with various bonuses or penalties to skills such as Bargain or Etiquette, which reflect your understanding of the layout of this place and the lives of its people. However, Titan is a fast moving and unpredictable world and the people's memories are short when it comes to showering them with praise or holding grudges. Should you leave a location for a day or more, you lose all these bonuses and penalties and start again with a fresh slate.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 89

## Settlement Social Encounters

In this section are the ‘social encounters’, so called because it is usually possible to avoid combat and success is achieved by using social skills - Etiquette,
Con, Bargain, Leadership and a few others.
Each person you meet has a ‘Social Rank’. For more details on social rank and how it is used, see section 7.2 ‘Social Status & Rank’. The important point to remember is that the difference in social rank acts as a modifier to skill tests for Etiquette, Con, Bargain or
Leadership rolls. If your Character has a social rank of 5 and they are talking to a Leper with social rank 2, they have a +3 bonus to their skill tests. If however they are talking to a Young Noble who has social rank 7, they have a -2 penalty. Characteres start their adventures with a social rank of 3. Progress is made by completing adventures.
Characteres should also consider how long it takes to complete an encounter - if you are in hot pursuit of a villain, you may not have time to spend half an hour to an hour chatting with a washerwoman.
Temporary skill bonuses and penalties: Many of the encounters give you an opportunity to gain a bonus to a future skill use, though often at the risk of suffering a penalty. Such bonuses and penalties last until you use them (usually by making a skill test) or leave that settlement for a day or more. Remember that if you want to retire to an inn or drinking den to
‘wait it out’, you have to pay the cost of food and lodging.
Call for Aid!
From time to time Characteres might come across people they can convince to join their cause. This will be described in the text as ‘So-and-so says you may call upon their aid’. The Character may ask this person to fight alongside them, usually for one encounter only (as described in the text). The Character will have to make the combat rolls for them according to the standard rules and they will mimic the Character - if the Character flees, they flee too.
Important note: This feature is intended to provide some assistance to the Characteres, not allow them to build up an army of followers! You should only have one of each type of person available to help you - so if you have already met a peasant today and persuaded them to help you, no more will be persuaded to help you until you have used their services.

Hunched against the side of a building with their begging bowl next to them is the sad figure of a leper.
His hands and face are wrapped in dirty bandages that do not quite conceal the ravages of the disease.
A small bell is tied on a rope around their neck, to warn strangers not to approach too closely. As you pass by, they reach out a hand and ask if you can spare a coin or two. What do you do?
● This man has a terrible affliction and you are fearful of it. Pulling your cape across your face and holding your breath, you scurry past as quickly as possible.
● This terrible affliction has no cure, but you can ease their suffering. Being careful not to touch them, you place 2 gold pieces into their begging bowl and offer up a prayer to whatever gods may be listening. The leper thanks you; you may call upon their aid once whilst in this city, but only if you are in Slum Alley, Graveyard, Dump or Infirmary locations.
● Their very presence threatens you and everyone else! You curse them and strike out with your weapon, telling them to begone! The leper cries out and, grabbing his bowl, shuffles off in a pathetic fashion.

A pathetic whimpering noise catches your a8ention.
You look around and realise that what you thought was a pile of refuse is a person, dressed in tattered rags and with a set of heavy manacles on their wrists.
You can see they have been branded on their face and arms, meaning that they must be an escaped slave.
They look up at you and plead for a little bit of food or gold, for they are starving. What do you do?
● Pass them a bit of food (deduct one rations from your inventory) and move on. You don’t have time to deal with their troubles.
● The manacles are large but ill-made. You offer to try and break them off - make a SKILL test using the
Strength or Locks Skill. If you succeed the slave is truly grateful and you may call upon their aid once at a later point, when in the slums or garbage heap locations.

One of the best jobs for a boy is to be apprenticed to a noble as their squire.

It is not uncommon to see them around town, noticeable by their a8ire, and you have spotted one such lad hurrying about his errands.

It is not unusual to see servants, alone or in groups, hurrying about completing chores for their masters.
Most of the time you ignore them but this woman has caught your a8ention.
She is dressed in the usual servant garb - leather boots, woollen clothing in several layers, a cloth cap and is carrying a lidded basket which probably contains firewood or clothes for washing, you can’t tell at the moment.
Something about her manner is unusual, she is a bit bolder than most of the downtrodden workers you see and isn’t put off by your obvious aura of danger.
As you look over, you see that she is also looking back at you with curiosity. What do you do?
● People stare at you all the time, mostly due to the scars and weapons. Pay her no mind and continue with your day.
● Servants are a good source of information. You approach and try to make small talk. Make a test using the Etiquette skill. If successful you may roll on
Table 8.7 Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events and
gain +1 to your next City Lore test in this location.
● It’s rude of her to stare. You snarl at her and make a motion as if you are about to draw your weapons.
Make a test against Etiquette. If you succeed she drops her basket and runs off. If you fail she is startled, but simply turns away. Either way, it is unclear what you have achieved.

A8acking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Before you stands a young man dressed in the expensive clothing of a noble: A blue silk shirt, leather trousers and boots, a belt with a silver buckle and a dark velvet cloak. He has a fencing sword strapped at his hip and an expression of mild contempt on his face. His every movement tells you that he is looking for an opportunity to show off his swordsmanship. What do you do?
● Compliment him on his fashion sense - test your
Etiquette, if successful the noble will offer to buy you a drink! If you meet another noble on this visit to civilization, add +1 to any social rolls as your good name has circulated. If you fail, your attempted compliment backfires and he insults you - your next social skill roll is at -1 due to embarrassment.
● Insult him - make a Con roll - if successful he scurries away, but if you fail, he attacks you and you must fight (It is not Unlawful to defend yourself).
● Challenge him to a duel: He will readily accept, swishing his sword around with anticipation. You can ask for or offer surrender at any point - he will surrender if below 4 STAMINA. If you surrender he will accept but viciously cut your face as he does so - you suffer -1 Etiquette for a week as it heals. If you duel to the death it is an Unlawful Action and you will need to roll on the ‘Lawbreaker’ table.
● A8empt to inspire him with your tales of adventure: Make a Leadership roll. If you succeed you can call upon his aid once whilst in the Streets,
Wealthy Streets, Inn or Tavern locations. He will fight with you for one combat. If you fail, he mocks your puny achievements and saunters off to tell his friends about you. Your next Leadership skill test is at -1.

S16 Burnt Out building
Your nose alerts you to something of interest before you see it. A strong smell of smoke is wafting up from the smouldering remains of what was probably a small house or shop. It has collapsed in upon itself, or been knocked down by fire wardens to prevent the fire from spreading and is now a chaotic pile of broken and burnt timbers, wall sections, tiling and furniture. You have clearly arrived some time after the fire was extinguished as the only people paying a8ention to this mess at the moment are you and a few soot covered children picking away at the wreckage. There are no immediate signs of the former occupants. What would you like to do?
● This is just some sort of domestic accident, not of any interest - move on to your next encounter.
● Some poor family lost their home today. Talking to the children you find out that they know them, so you offer a couple of gold pieces from your pouch, trusting them to pass it on. Deduct 2 GP from your inventory. Word of your generosity spreads fast and you may add +2 to your next Etiquette test in this settlement.
● Maybe these children are onto something? Pulling a bit of cloth across your face you start to hunt around in the wreckage. Make an Awareness Skill test.
If you succeed you find a keepsake worth 1sp. Taking your loot you sidle off, leaving behind a trail of ash and smuts. You may want to clean your boots at some point.
● Perhaps the gods will help? You stop, get down to your knees and spend a few minutes in thoughtful prayer, asking the gods to intercede. Roll 1d6 - on a roll of 5 or 6, this house will be rebuilt as a workshop
(encounter M26) within 2d6 days. You may choose the type of workshop and will always receive a 20% discount when using its services.

You hear a noise that you think at first might be someone choking, but it turns out to be a red-faced dwarf, singing loudly and waving around a half-full tankard of ale. In his other hand he holds a small cask from which he occasionally takes a top up. It is clear from his staggering approach that he has been celebrating for some time and is feeling the effects. He is dressed in a blue co8on shirt and breeches tucked underneath a chainmail shirt. A heavy warhammer hangs from a loop on his belt. He has a large foam flecked beard of curly red whiskers, and a mop of curly hair above a pair of twinkling citrine coloured eyes.  The dwarf is clearly in a very good mood and offers you a hearty greeting. What do you do?
● Accept his greeting and share a drink with him, telling each other tales of adventure. Make an
Etiquette skill roll, on a success he will gift you his tankard. It is a heavy pewter tankard, embossed with pictures of dwarves ba8ling goblins and has the le8ers ‘MM’ inscribed on the base. On a failure, you depart as friends but with no exchange of gifts.
● Acknowledge his greeting but slide away at the first opportunity; move on to your next encounter.
● Cuff him away and insult his singing; make a Con skill roll; if successful he gulps down a big swallow of ale and scurries away, on a failure he throws the remains of his cup in your face and walks off laughing. Your next Con roll is at -1.
● Throwing your arm around him, you decide to join in the party. The rest of the night is lost to a haze of alcohol and song, you wake up the next day in a random location in the city. Miraculously unharmed but with 3d6gp less in your pocket.

The world is teeming with peasants - those people who are just scraping by through a combination of common skills and physical labour, whether it be assisting a craftsman, digging the crops or just standing in a field minding the pigs, most people you pass in the street fall into this category. In general you go by with just a nod or greeting, but sometimes you stop for a longer chat. On this occasion you have come across a likely fellow, leaning up against a post with a pot of small beer in one hand and the general air of a man who is looking for a lost goat, but taking his time about it. What do you do?
● No harm in taking a break. You decide to stop and chat with them about nothing in particular - you can make a roll on the Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events tables.
● This lad might have seen something interesting whilst he was standing here. Make an Etiquette roll.
If successful he turns out to be a mine of useful information and you gain a +1 bonus to your next
City Lore or Etiquette roll. If unsuccessful, all you get out of him is a series of drawn out ‘yaarrs’ as it becomes clear he has had a few too many beers.
● Many peasants dream of living the adventuring life, maybe this one is up for it. You decide to inspire them, telling tales of daring feats, terrible combat and rich rewards. Make a Leadership roll. If you succeed, they will help you for a short time - they will assist you by providing either a +1 to your combat roll or social skills rolls in this location for the rest of today, after which they will get back to whatever duties their employer requires. If you leave this location, the bonus is lost as they go back to their work.

Hurrying past you so close that you have to take a step aside to avoid a collision, a robed woman catches your eye. She stops to apologise for her haste and quickly explains that she has some urgent duties at the Temple, and that the gods must not be kept waiting. You notice that she has some symbols stitched into her clothing and some jewellery that might or might not have a deeper meaning - make a
Religion Lore roll with a +2 bonus. If you succeed, you have identified which god she serves and have +2 to all social skill tests for this encounter (or, if you are the same religion, automatically succeed).  To find out what religion they belong to, refer to section 7.1 which sets out how to choose a specific god for a temple or priest, or you can simply choose a religion that is appropriate for your setting.   As she has now stopped to talk to you, what do you want to do?
● Her god is not your god. You ask her to watch where she is going in future and you move on.
● Engage her in conversation about her faith. Make an Etiquette Skill roll. If you succeed she is so pleased by this conversation she promises to pray for you at her Temple. During your next combat, you gain +1 bonus to your combat rolls from this blessing.
● Religion is for the weak willed, a fact you can use to your advantage. Make a Con roll. If you succeed, you have convinced her that you are also a follower and on a secret mission that needs her help. She will offer you either a donation of 2d6 gold pieces or the chance to call upon her aid. You must choose one option now. If you fail your Con roll, she sees through your ruse and turns away haughtily, promising to warn others about you. Lose 1 point of LUCK.

A8acking this person is an Unlawful Action.
You spy an older man dressed in long pa8erned robes and a similarly decorated satin hat. He is holding a carved staff and talking to a group of nervous looking peasants. After a few moments he dismisses them and, as he turns to leave, notices you studying him.
His clothes and staff mark him out as a person of distinction, but behind the hefty grey beard a welcoming smile has appeared and it looks like you have a chance to talk to him before he moves on.
Firstly, you should make a Religion Lore roll with a bonus of +4 (priests do not generally try to hide their religion) and if you succeed, you know which god he follows and you gain +2 bonus to your social skill rolls for the remainder of this encounter (or, if you are the same religion, automatically succeed).
To find out what religion they belong to, refer to section 7.1 which sets out how to choose a specific god for a temple or priest, or you can simply choose a religion that is appropriate for your setting.
Now that you have the priest’s a8ention, what do you do?
● Meeting an actual priest is a stroke of good fortune as you are in need of healing; you beseech him to mend your wounds. Make an Etiquette or Religion
Lore roll - if you succeed he will heal you for 6 points of STAMINA. If you fail, he tells you that others are in greater need and bids you hurry to the hospital.
● Falling to one knee, you profess your joy at meeting a true servant of the gods; you offer him a donation of 2d6 gold pieces for his Temple (deduct this from your total). The old priest places his hand on your head and offers up a prayer of blessing; roll 1d6 - on a 5 or
6 the gods have listened and you gain +1 point of
LUCK.
● He may look friendly, but priests are known to be cunning and greedy too! You nod at him before swiftly moving on to your next encounter.
● Temples have resources that could be of use to you and a priest will have the keys. You can try to convince this priest to offer you some aid - make a
Leadership or Con Skill test with a -2 penalty.
If you succeed, the priest gives you a vial of holy water - you can use it to instantly deal 2d6 points of damage to any undead monsters you meet (it has one use only). If you fail, the priest tells you that other causes are more needy and shoos you away.
● If you are injured you may ask for healing. If you are dedicated (you are a priest, paladin or avowed follower) to the same religion as this priest, or to a religion of the same broad alignment (good, neutral, evil) they will heal you for 6 points of STAMINA damage. If you are not openly dedicated to a similar religion you must test your LUCK to receive this healing.
● Engage them in a discussion about religious ma8ers, something priests are always happy to do.
After 1d3 hours you are able to bring the conversation to an end, but you do receive +2 to your next Religious Lore roll.

● Tell them you are a bit lost and ask them for directions - make an Etiquette roll. If successful they give you a few directions and you gain +1 to your next City Lore roll. If unsuccessful they give you just one direction - be on your way.
● Getting The Watch on your side would be very helpful - you explain your predicament and try to convince them to help you. It is difficult, as they would rather go to a tavern than help a dangerous adventurer. Make a Law skill roll with a -3 penalty. If successful you may call upon the aid of one watchman once in this settlement (but not in the

A8acking this person is an Unlawful Action.
It is hard to ignore the extremely large wild haired man, dressed in furs and leather, that is striding toward you. Across his shoulders lies a large and wicked looking axe and as he approaches you he takes an enormous gulp of beer from a tankard before tossing it carelessly over his shoulder.
Pulling his axe down to his side and stamping it onto the ground the barbarian points at you and speaks.
‘You there, adventurer - come and show your worth!
Stand and fight me if you dare!’.
You notice a small crowd of bored peasants has appeared, seemingly from nowhere, to watch this exciting turn of events.  What do you do?
● Oh, this looks bad. Before things have a chance to get worse, you turn and shove your way through the crowd and dash away as the laughter of the barbarian echoes in your ears. Move to your next location.
● Smiling, you offer a terse ‘very well’ and accept the challenge. Fight 4 rounds of combat with the barbarian. Whoever has lost the most STAMINA in that time is the loser. If you win, the barbarian thanks you for the challenge and offers to buy you a drink.
Gain +2 to your next Leadership skill roll. If you lose, the barbarian still offers to buy you a drink and you part as friends. In the case of a draw, you may either move on to your next encounter or fight another 3 rounds of combat.
● Snarling, you draw your weapons. This fool should not have disturbed you and now they will pay. You fight the barbarian to the death. The crowd of peasants was excited by the prospect of some action,

but left horrified at the casual manner in which you dispatched your opponent. Add +2 to your next Con roll as word of your savage nature gets around the local area.
● You are a poet, not a fighter: You try to persuade this hefty drunkard to put down his weapons and come for a drink. Make an Etiquette skill roll with a
+3 bonus if you have any alcohol to offer him as a bribe. If you succeed, he recognises you as some kind of bard and agrees to swap life stories: you gain +2 to your next Forest or Mountain Lore roll. If you fail, he is angered by your attempt at friendliness. He grabs you mid sentence and hurls you across the ground leaving you in a crumpled heap. Your next

‘Pies for sale! Hot pies for sale! Get’em before they’re cold, get’em before they’re all sold!’ Comes the cry of a wandering pie seller. Dressed in peasant garb, but with a greasy apron across the front, a young woman is carrying a cloth lined wooden tray filled to the brim with a wide selection of pastry topped pies. They are evidently freshly cooked as steam rises from them and a mouth-watering smell of cooked meat and pastry fills the air. What do you do?
● You’ve no need for food just now, so you move on to your next encounter with a grumbling stomach.
● Buy a delicious pie, of course! For the cost of 1gp you can acquire a large and tasty meat pie. Roll a 1d6 when you eat it - on a roll of 1 you have unfortunately ended up with a bit more sewer rat in your pie than expected, and you spit it out in disgust (the pie seller has moved on by this point - no refunds). On a 2-6 you get a delicious pie which restores 3 points of stamina (and counts as one of your meals for today).
Yum yum.
● You want a pie but don’t feel like paying for it. You can attempt a Con skill roll with a -3 penalty to wheedle a free pie out of her. If you fail, she is disgusted with your begging and moves on. If you get a pie, make a roll as above.
● You wait a moment and watch. As people jostle around her, salivating at the prospect of a well cooked pie, you could try to pinch one. Sliding into the crowd, you may make a Sleight of Hand skill roll.
If you succeed, you manage to sneak away with an illicit pie (make a roll as above to determine the quality) but if you fail, your larceny is spotted. The pie seller slaps your hand away and the crowd looks at you suspiciously - you must slink away to another location.
● For whatever malicious reason, you have taken a dislike to this purveyor of baked meats. Rushing up to her, you whack your hand underneath the tray sending pies spinning in every direction. A look of shock on her face is quickly replaced by tears as she scrabbles around picking up the ones that are intact.

His cart is almost empty of vegetables but despite that he seems to be grumbling about something and generally a bit upset with the world, stamping around in the mud in his thick work boots and pushing and slapping at his ass, which stands forlornly in the harness.

If you succeed it seems to take his mind off his problems and in return he provides you with an explanation of the local farming conditions and best varieties of turnip and cabbage that should be planted. Gain 1 point in Region Lore -

If you want to help you can make a Strength skill roll to help him shift it (if you don’t want to help you can make your excuses and leave). If you fail, you are embarrassed and must move on to the next encounter. if you succeed you shove the cart out of the mud and he thanks you with a bag of assorted vegetables - gain two meals and you may Call Upon the Aid of this NPC once, but only when you are in the Marketplace or outside the city walls.

You were trying to avoid the shuffling chanting figure but unfortunately as you pass you catch his eye.
Stopping in his tracks the man reaches out his hands towards you and implores you to abandon your path and look to the gods for salvation, lest ye be damned, damned!
Now that you are caught by his intense gaze, you can get a better look. Before you stands an older man with a bald head and a scraggly grey beard. He is dressed in tattered clothing that has been crudely repaired in many places.
Most noticeably he has several large ropes and chains tied around his body in ways that look designed to be uncomfortable and you can see that the bare skin around his neck and chest is chafed and bloody from the punishment. He is clearly some kind of religious zealot who has taken it upon themselves to purify himself through suffering. Perhaps he wants you to join him? What do you do?
● Shaking yourself free from his grasping, bony hands you stammer something about how much you respect all the gods and quickly move on before he can grab you again. Carry on forward to your next encounter.
● Filthy Cur! How dare this madman put his hands on you - with a snarl you shove him away and let out a string of curses. As he falls back he makes a strange sign in the air toward you before scuttling away. Roll 1d6 - on a roll of a 1 you have angered the gods and lose one point of LUCK. On a roll of a 6 you have pleased some deity and gain one point of LUCK.

● This man is clearly troubled by life and it may help him if you at least listen. You find a quiet spot nearby and let him explain his message. He rambles on for some time, speaking intensely about his grand vision of the universe and how best to serve the gods, before eventually tiring to the point of near silence. He thanks you for listening, then gets up and shuffles off, seemingly drained by the effort of talking. The next time you visit a Temple, restore one point of LUCK as the gods acknowledge your act of charity. However, close contact with this man comes with peril. Roll a 1d6 - on a 1 or 2 you have caught a disease. Roll on

## Table 4.3.2 ‘Diseases’ to see what has befallen you.

● Perhaps you can take advantage of this crackpot?
Pulling him to one side you tell him that you too are on a religiously inspired quest and whilst you can’t reveal all the details, the gods have asked you to gather the faithful to your cause. Will he help? Make a Con skill test. If you succeed you may Call Upon the
Aid of this fellow when you are in the Temple, Slums or Graveyard locations - he will fight alongside you with wild fervour, adding +1 to his damage rolls if he hits with his club. However, if you fail your Con skill test he has seen through your lies and shoves you away hurling curses and denouncing your lack of faith, much to the amusement of those other citizens passing by. You lose one point of LUCK.

● Perhaps this wealthy man can offer you a job or become your patron. You move in front of him and, ignoring the crossbows pointed in your direction, introduce yourself as an adventurer for hire. You must test your LUCK - if you are successful the nobleman listens to your story with interest and, after some consideration reveals to you the location of a
Catacomb (encounter M4) within the settlement
(drop or roll a dice onto your map to find where the entrance is) that has been concerning him. If you are willing to clear it out - defeat all the monsters you find within - he will send a messenger to find you with a purse containing 4d6gp as a reward! If you fail the LUCK test he listens to half your tale before dismissing you as a charlatan, telling his guards to keep an eye on you as they leave.
● It’s grossly unfair that this man should be so wealthy whilst others suffer! You step towards him and, ignoring the warning stares of the crossbowmen, confront him about the state of the city and demand to know what he is planning to do. Make a Con roll with a -3 penalty. If successful, you actually manage to shame him into making a few promises of improvements. You may add +1 to your Leadership skill, permanently, in this settlement. If you fail, however, the nobleman is upset with your haranguing and orders his guards to deal with you.

In a quiet corner you can see a pair of mummers
(actors) who are taking a few moments to go over their roles. A man and a woman, they are both wearing large amounts of make-up and large awkwardly balanced wigs sit on their heads. From what you can tell the current scene is a very dramatic one, on top of which the pair appear to be somewhat drunk.
At their feet is a trunk containing a variety of pieces of costume clothing and props. They are quite absorbed in their rehearsal but there is nothing to stop you approaching them should you wish too - they don’t look dangerous after all. What do you do?
● Gossip from the theatre is unlikely to be useful.
Dismissing them, you move on to your next encounter.
● Stroll up, put on your most charming smile and strike up a conversation with them. They are mostly interested in two topics: The social life of the city and themselves. Still, if you can make an Etiquette check you can steer the discussion a little. Gain a +1 on your next social skill roll and roll on the Rumours & Events table. If you fail, they mock you mercilessly and your confidence takes a knock - your next Leadership roll is at -2.
● Whilst they are absorbed in their practice, try to pinch something from their trunk. Make a sleight of hand roll. If you succeed, roll once on the Everyday
Items treasure table. If you fail, they spot your larceny and start a hue and cry which is bound to a8ract the Watch soon. Give them a smug leer and move to another location.

● They aren’t doing anything useful or important, so you try to recruit them. Make a Leadership skill roll.
Success means you may Call Upon their Aid. In one future encounter.  They will either arrive and pretend to be skilled swordsmen, distracting your opponent and causing them a -2 penalty, or they can help you out in a Social encounter, pretending to be your sidekicks and adding +2 to your social skill rolls. You can only do this in the Inn, Tavern, Drinking Den or Theatre locations.
● Ask them for some tips and tricks on the fine art of acting; For a small fee - 5gp - they will spend an hour or so with you showing you a bit of their skills and teaching you a few tricks. You can add +2 to your next

A hunter has come to town to sell his haul of furs.
Next to him he has a wooden rack covered in pelts and furs of a number of creatures, all cleaned and ready for working into clothing or some other household use. The hunter is a rough looking man, not young, with the hard face of someone who has spent many days and nights in the wilderness. Dark eyes look out from under the brim of foxtail hat and his long beard is braided into a plait which blends into his bear hide poncho. It is clear that he is a skilled trapper, but what does he know of the city? What do you do?
● You feel it is unlikely that he can help you, so with a curt nod you move on to your next encounter.
● Trade with him: He is not interested in buying anything, but you can purchase fur and hide clothing as listed on the equipment list in the Advanced
Fighting Fantasy rulebook. Remember to make your Bargain roll.
● Feigning an interest in his wares, you strike up a conversation to see if he knows anything that can help you. Make an Etiquette roll. If you succeed he shares some information about things he has noticed in the city and you gain +2 on your next Hunting or

● Wait until he is distracted with a customer and try to steal something from his rack. Make a Sleight of hand roll to see if you manage to purloin something.
If you succeed you get a fox fur worth 2d6gp. If you fail, he notices you and attacks! You must fight him or retreat. Fighting him is still considered an Unlawful

A8acking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Your eye is drawn to a heavily armed and armoured man who is si8ing working on the edge of his sword with a whetstone. Judging by his demeanour and the crest on his shield, which is resting at the back of his seat, you guess that he is a knight-errant - a capable fighter that moves from lord to lord seeking out opportunities to prove their valour according to the knightly code. From the look of him, you think that he might be from Gallantaria. Even though he is wearing armour and a heavy travel worn cloak, you can tell that he is a powerful warrior and could be either a useful ally or a dangerous foe. What do you do?
● Knights and their codes of behaviour are troublesome. Avoiding his a8ention, move on to your next encounter.
● Maybe you could recruit him? Approaching the knight, you introduce yourself and explain your mission. Make an Etiquette or Leadership roll with a
-3 penalty. If successful, he is impressed with your
bravery and agrees to Come to Your Aid - you may call upon him once in this settlement, he will appear and fight alongside you for one combat. If you fail the roll, he listens politely but deems your exploits to be unworthy.
● Knight or not, you’re going to knock the polish off his armour. You march up to him and demand satisfaction - he is shocked, but after a moment agrees to fight you, provided there are some rules. You will fight for five rounds of melee combat, whoever wins the most rounds is the victor. You may submit at any point (though he will not unless reduced to 3
STAMINA or less). If you should defeat the knight, he

grudgingly hands you a purse of 10 gold pieces as your prize. If you lose, he lectures you at some length about pride and its dangers and your next
Leadership skill roll is at -2. If you don’t like his rules you can either attack him anyway (this will be an
Unlawful Action) or sneer at him and move on to your next encounter.
● A warrior such as this must have some wisdom or tips that they could pass on, perhaps you can convince them to provide you with a quick training session? After introducing yourself and explaining your request the knight tells you that his services come with a price - test your Bargain skill if you are willing to pay the 2d6gp he is charging. If you fail the test your offer is too low and he grumpily requests that you move on. If you succeed the knight-errant takes your coin, agrees to spar with you and try to correct the flaws in your technique. Sparring takes several hours, so make sure you have the time to spare before you start. At the end of this class you feel you have sharpened your wits and loosened your arm, you have +1 to your combat rolls and damage rolls until the end of the next day. You may request this service if you meet the knight again, but only once per week.
● A knight from the Old World must have travelled far and wide and learnt a great deal. You resolve to sit with him and make conversation - make an Etiquette skill roll. If you succeed you can spend a few hours swapping tales - increase your World Lore skill by one permanently (this can only happen on your first meeting with the Knight, on subsequent meetings gain a temporary +1 bonus to World Lore).

Much to your dismay, you have caught the eye of a tithe collector, sent out on the official business of getting revenue for his lord or lady. This rotund middle aged man, dressed in good cloth as fits his station, carries with them a large book detailing the expected rates and payments along with a carved wooden seal which grants them the authority to charge a levy as they decide. You let out a sigh, because you know that once you have been entered into the lists by the collector they will seek you out again in the future. In the meantime it is likely they will charge you. Already, you can see the tithe collector is leafing through their book, no doubt trying to work out how much should be charged on a
‘Character’. What do you do?
● Quickly, you try to dash away before they can latch onto you. Make a test against your Sneaking skill. If successful you manage to slip away unnoticed, but if you fail, the tithe collector intercepts you; add +1 to your roll on the table below.
● Try and talk your way out of it. Make a test against your Con or Law skill. If you succeed you convince the Tithe Collector that you’ve already paid your dues for this season. If you fail, he is upset by your blustering and increases your charge - add +1 to your roll on the tithing table below.
● Accept your fate and make the payment as required. It’s painful, but the alternative is being thrown out of the settlement, so you grit your teeth and put up with it.
1d6 Tithe 1
The collector has mistaken you for somebody

else, probably a peasant or labourer. You

might be upset by this but on the other hand,

it means he thinks you have already paid your due and leaves you alone - this time.
2
The man flicks through his lists, struggling to

find a suitable reason for taking your money.

In the end, he se8les on a charge of one gold

piece, but with the promise that he’ll

definitely expect more from you next time.
3
There is a bit of a discussion about what you

should be taxed as and in the end you manage to convince him that you are basically a

servant and really aren’t worth that much.

Your charge is a relatively minor 1d6 gp.
4
Waving his seal under your nose and

generally making it clear that you are beneath him, the Collector eventually decides that

being a sell-sword makes you a type of

merchant and charges you 2d6 gold pieces.
5
The tithes have been poor this year and the

Collector is looking to make up some of the

shortfall. With a nasty smile on his face, he

levies you for 4d6 gold pieces.
6
Perhaps the Collector was beaten up by an

adventurer recently, because he seems to find

all sorts of reasons to levy you - sword tax,

armour tax, boots tax and so on - it all adds up to a charge of 8d6 gold pieces! It’s a shocking

fee, but what choice do you have?
Special: A8acking the Tithe Collector is considered to be an extremely serious offence. If you do take this choice, you must apply a -3 penalty to your roll on the
Lawbreaker table, which must be done immediately, as the Watch keeps a careful eye on him.
Special: If all else fails, you may test your LUCK to avoid the tithe. If you succeed, a messenger runs up and he is called away immediately, but if you fail the
LUCK test you roll again on the tithe table adding +1 to the result. Double taxed!

He has a well worn knapsack on a strap over one shoulder and on the other side, he has an unusual leather harness containing a small oak barrel, from which he is dispensing samples of the monks’ work. A strong whiff of liquor wafting around here tells you that it is some sort of brandy or spirit that he is selling. Free alcohol is, naturally, a8racting a small crowd of interested peasants and judging by the loudness of the conversation the friar has also been sampling his own supply. What do you do?

● Waiting for your opportunity, you ask the friar if he is capable of healing your wounds. Make an Etiquette skill roll with a +3 bonus; if successful he is happy to spend a little time bandaging you up (you may recover 3 points of STAMINA). If you fail the roll he is a bit upset at your interruption and asks you to go to a temple instead. A Priest of Galana automatically succeeds at this roll.
● You decide to have a bit of fun with this crowd; putting on your most menacing air, you start barging your way into them, knocking drinks out of their hands and shoving people around. You make it clear to the friar he will need to give you something to get rid of you. Make a Con skill roll.

Watch or find yourself in the Jail or City Gate locations you can try and report him - make a test of your Law skill. If you succeed, The Watch gives you a reward of 1gp for the information, if you fail the test they have no idea who you are talking about.

Coughing and spluttering their last, you have come across a victim of the type of violence that is all too common in the city. It is clear that without assistance this person will soon be going to meet their maker.
What do you do?
● You don’t know why they’ve ended up this way and you don’t want to find out. Averting your eyes, you move on.
● This poor wretch needs your help, urgently. You can use either the Healing skill or, if you have it, magical healing to aid them. If you use the Healing skill you must pass a skill test to have an effect. If your healing is successful, you staunch their wounds and bring them back to consciousness. You may also move them to a Temple or Hospital location and pay 5gp to the priests to save them if you have no trust in your own healing skills. If you should save them, they are too weak to do much more than thankyou for your help but promise to remember you. If you should die in this settlement, roll 1d6 - on a roll of 1 your new friend happens to be passing by and will return the favour by pulling you to safety! You will wake up at one of the Temple locations, with all your gear and one point of STAMINA. The life-debt is repaid.

## Settlement Challenge Encounters

In this section are the ‘challenge encounters’, so called because they involve some level of danger to your
Character, although some can be avoided by use of social or movement based skills.
Characteres should consider how long it takes to complete an encounter - if you are in hot pursuit of a villain, you may not have time to attend an Archery Contest.
Temporary skill bonuses and penalties: Some of these encounters give you an opportunity to gain a bonus to a future skill use, though often at the risk of suffering a penalty. Such bonuses and penalties last until you use them (usually by making a skill test) or leave that settlement for a day or more. Remember that if you want to retire to an inn or drinking den to
‘wait it out’, you have to pay the cost of food and lodging.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 119 Standard Encounter Options
As a reminder, in Chapter 3 we detailed a number of encounter options. A Character may wish to use this (or others they can think of) to deal with the challenges they face.
Table 3.1.1 Standard Encounter Options -
see descriptions in Chapter 3 for more details.

normal combat rules, you may use a

ranged weapon or spell in the first

round if you have spotted your target.

escape or suffer a ‘free hit’.
Sneak
A8empt to use Sneaking to get past

your target, consider what bonuses or

penalties apply.

Trick
A8empt to trick your target in some

A8acking this person is not an Unlawful Action.
Make a test against your Awareness Skill with
-3 penalty. If you fail, a skilled cutpurse has relieved
you of 2d6 gold pieces. Deduct them from your total and with a heavy sigh, move on with your adventure.
If you succeed, you have noticed the attempt and must decide what to do.
● Slap her hand away and tell her to stop bothering you. The next time you encounter a cutpurse you may ignore it, as she recognises you. Move on to your next encounter.
● You notice the hand working a blade towards your coin pouch, and with a swift movement you attempt to grab and twist the wrist. Make a SKILL test. If you succeed, you have caught this thief and can hold onto her for long enough to a8ract the notice of a
Watchman. Hand her over to receive a bounty of 1d6 gold pieces. If you don’t like doing the dirty work for the Watch, you may fight her. This is not an Unlawful Action.
● You spin about and growl in the face of this thief.
Make a Leadership Skill test. If you succeed she cowers before you and you may question her about this location. Add +2 to your next City Lore or
Secret Signs test. If you fail, she is startled but not intimidated and will flee.

C2 Falling Masonry
You are walking along minding your own business and trying to work out where to go next when you hear a creak and a snap from above you - a part of the building you are passing has broken off and bricks and tiles are plummeting toward you!
Make a LUCK test (or test your skill to Dodge). If you succeed you manage to dive out of the way. You may continue on your way.
If you fail, you are caught by the falling debris and suffer 1d3 points of damage. Cursing your ill fortune, there is nothing to do but dust yourself down and continue your travels.
C3 Falling Nightsoil
Passing along a narrow street lost in your own thoughts you hear a shout of ‘mind out below!’ as the contents of someone's bedpan are tossed out of a window above you! You have only a moment to dive out of the way and avoid the stinking slurry.
Make a LUCK test (or you may test against your
SKILL, using the Dodge Skill if you have it). If you succeed you manage to sidestep the spla8er and after aiming a few curses upwards, you may continue with your adventure.   If you fail you are drenched in waste. For a moment you stand stock still, contemplating the disaster. What do you do?
● Accept your fate and march on. Due to the stench you will be at -3 to all Social Skill tests until you have a chance to clean yourself (at an inn or river).
● Vengeance! Drawing your weapon you smash through the door of the offending house and rush upstairs, where you apply a hefty beating to the poor fellow that drenched you. He begs your forgiveness and helps clean off the muck, but your violence has been noticed by the locals who have called the Watch, and you must roll on the Lawbreaker table, with a minimum result of 6.
C4 Funeral Cortege
Carrying a coffin draped in dark cloth, a group of mourners are making their way down the street. They are dressed mostly in black with hoods obscuring their faces.
Four men carry the casket, trudging their footsteps through the filthy mud of this alleyway. At the head of the procession a tall woman carries a large gong with which she is beating out the slow rhythm of their march and next to her a short but very rotund man is waving an incense burner and chanting a dirge.
They take up most of the narrow street. You stop, thinking to pay your respects as they pass. What do you do?
● Bow your head and offer up a prayer as they pass.
Make a LUCK roll. If you fail the procession stops as it reaches you and the coffin is opened, revealing it to be empty -  these are not mourners, they are actually cultists looking for a victim to fill it! Fight them to survive. If you pass the LUCK test, the cortege slowly moves by.
● Something about this bothers you. Make an
Awareness SKILL roll - if successful you spot the bulges of concealed weapons under their robes and recognise the chants as those of a foul death cult...you have just enough time to slip away down a side alley before these cultists reach you. If you fail the roll, make a LUCK roll as above to see if they wish to grab you!
● You’ve no time for this sentimentality. You barge forward, secretly hoping that they drop the coffin as you jostle them. Moments later you realise your mistake as the Cultists attack you - they want you in that coffin! Make a test of your Strength skill - if you succeed, you have scared the cultists with your belligerence and fight with a +2 bonus.

There are 6 cultists that must be fought off, they will fight to the last. You must fight them three at a time.
They wield clubs as weapons (concealed in their loose robes) and they have no armour.
If you wish to avoid fighting them, you can attempt to make a Con roll with a -3 penalty to convince them that you are another member of the same cult, just checking up on them. If the attempt fails, it’s time to fight.
If you survive this fight you may loot a pack of incense, an incense burner and a bronze gong should you wish to take them. They can be sold for 20gp or kept (they take up one encumbrance slot).
C5 Archery Contest
An archery contest is being held! A local lord wants to call on the support of his archers and to make sure that the peasants are training as the law requires.
All may enter for a fee of 3gp and try to win a prize.
Each archer is given 10 shots to prove their worth.
For each shot, make a combat roll (2d6 + your skill) and compare it to the following target numbers to see where you hit:
● Bullseye (12 points) - 22
● Yellow Rings (8 points) - 18
● Red Rings (6 points)  - 15
● Blue Rings (3 points) - 13.
Tally up the points you score with 10 shots
(ammunition is provided). The prizes awarded are:
● 100 points or over - tournament winner, 100gp and
+1 on Etiquette and Leadership skill roles in this settlement due to your fame for a week.
● 80-99 points - a 25gp purse and much admiration from the crowd.
● 50-79 points - a 5gp purse and thanks for participating.
● Below 49 points - the mockery of your fellow competitors. Take a -2 penalty the next time you use a bow, due to your shaky confidence.
Participating in the competition can be assumed to take up most of the day.

C6 Black Powder explosion.
Ahead of you, you see a dwarven sapper is pulling a cart of barrels across an intersection. He loses his footing on some stones we8ed by last night's rain, slips and pulls the cart over. Before you can react, one of the barrels bounces free of the cart, spins across the slick cobbles before popping open and spilling its contents of black powder straight onto a small stove a footman is using to brew up his drink! There is a bone shuddering explosion! Roll against Dodge to dive out of the way. If successful you hurl yourself through a doorway and onto the floor of a hovel, avoiding damage. If unsuccessful you take 1d6+2 points of damage, plus the heat of the explosion knocks your boots and hat off, and singes away your hair, eyebrows and beard (if any). Deduct one from your next 3 social skill rolls as you get used to it and
-3 to Disguise skill rolls for a week as it grows back.
Either way you are deafened for one day, deduct 2 from your Awareness skill tests until tomorrow.
As you look around the aftermath you see the explosion has sca8ered the other barrels of powder around, knocked the sapper over, sent the footman flying along the alley and started several small fires.
How do you react?
● The job of the Character is to help others. You start putting out fires and attend to the footman, who is injured. Make a Healing roll. If successful you bring him round. He tells you his name is Rodni of Skoom, halberdier. You may call upon his aid once. He has
SKILL 7 STAMINA 8 and wields a halberd.
● As your head clears you realise what a mess this place is, which is just a distraction from your mission.
Pulling yourself to your feet you move on.
●In the aftermath, you notice that no one is paying a8ention to the black powder. Although you have heard it is a dangerous secret, you decide to steal a keg. Make a Sleight of Hand roll. If you fail you must roll on the Lawbreaker table. The keg can be sold for 75gp or it contains thirty ‘charges’ of black powder.
C7 Una=ended stall
Passing along a quiet street you notice a small stall selling a variety of interesting looking bric-a-brac. As you approach to see if there is anything of use to be had you realise that the stall is unattended and that there does not appear to be anyone around paying a8ention.
What do you do?
● Have a quick look at the stall and snaffle one item before hurrying away. You may choose either a small bronze ke8le suitable for brewing up a warming drink (worth 3gp), a cloak clasp fashioned from copper in the shape of an oak leaf (worth 1gp) or an iron rod, about 4 inches in length and covered in strange runes (worth 5gp). Sniggering to yourself you make your escape.
● Wait patiently until the stallholder appears and make sure no one else takes your advantage of the situation. After a few minutes an old tinker appears and thanks you for waiting. You may purchase any of the items noted above for 1g or continue with your travels. If you make a purchase, she chats to you about the area and you may re-roll the encounter for your next location.
● Using your Bargain or Evaluate skill you spend a few minutes carefully sifting through the items on sale. If you make a successful skill test you notice a pewter tankard that was made by a famous craftsman. When the tinker re-appears you may purchase it for 1g, it may be sold to another merchant for 20g! Add +1 to your LUCK score.

Initially, you think it to be some poor leper or other unfortunate that you may be able to help in some way, until it turns toward you showing a face of rotting flesh and exposed bone! Gasping in horror you realise this must be a ghoul, escaped from its crypt and hungry for flesh! At this moment it is leering at a screaming peasant and looks set to devour the poor defenceless wretch. What do you do?
● A terrible thing, to be sure, but not actually your problem - you can try and slip away unnoticed. Make a Sneaking Skill roll. If you succeed you can get away in the commotion. If you fail, you still escape the ghoul but your cowardice has been noticed (and will be widely reported!) and you suffer a -2 penalty to your next Leadership skill roll in this settlement.
● You are a Character and it is time to do your thing. You step forward, putting yourself between the ghoul and its intended victim.

A8acking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Any settlement will a8ract rats and mice and any large settlement will also gather some of their larger more aggressive kin - the Giant Rat. Unfortunately for you, you have disturbed one which is now leaping out from its hiding place to attack! With its vicious teeth and claws this pestilent creature needs dispatching as soon as possible. Your options are simple - kill it or flee.
Note, that should you be bi8en by this mucky creature (you take damage from an attack) you may become infected with a disease. Test your LUCK. If you fail, roll on the diseases table (Table 4.3.2
Diseases) to see what afflicts you.
If you succeed in killing it and you happen to be a dwarf, you may make a SKILL (Crafting) test to turn the Giant Rat into a dwarven delicacy, rat skewers. If you succeed you may gain one rations. For a non-
Dwarf, the SKILL test has a -4 penalty. (Just don’t think too carefully about what it was eating before you caught up with it).

Diseases
Unfortunately, the monsters of Titan are a hotbed of diseases and some encounters will grant you a chance of experiencing one of these for yourself. If you are required to do so, refer to the table below to see what effect your ailment has.
Diseases take effect from the morning after you contract the disease. Refer to the duration given to see how many days you have to suffer. Diseases can be addressed at the Temple or Hospital locations, for a fee. Once you have had a dose of disease, you will be immune to that disease (but not any others) for one week.

## Table 4.3.2 Diseases

d6 Disease

Effect 1 Gutrot

Your insides churn and swirl and nausea hits you in waves. Keeping down any

food is  hard and you may only benefit from eating rations once per day whilst you have gutrot.  It lasts for 1d6 days.
2 The Shivers

Your skin feels cold and clammy and uncontrollable shivers ra8le your bones. You must suffer a penalty of -2 to all skill rolls for physical activities (combat, jumping, climbing etc) whilst your body shudders. The Shivers last for 1d3 days.
3 Boils

Agonising boils have appeared on your skin in a number of awkward and

embarrassing locations. Even with bandaging and ointment, moving can result in

the sudden pain of a burst boil. Anytime you undertake a physical activity, roll a

1d6. On a 1 or 2 you have squeezed a boil and suffer a -2 penalty to SKILL for that round due to the pain. Boils last for 1d6 days.
4 Thunder Head
You awake with a cracking, throbbing headache and blurred vision. As you

stagger out of bed, shielding your eyes against the light, you realise that the next

few days are going to  be a struggle. All activities that involve thinking (social

skills, Lore skills, using Sorcery or Magic) suffer a -2 penalty due to your pounding head. Thunder Head lasts 1d3 days.
5 The Bubbles

Sounds nice doesn’t it? Well it isn’t. Somewhere inside of you gas is being

produced at a tremendous rate and escaping out of both ends. As well as feeling

bloated you are constantly either belching or farting, causing you to suffer a -1

penalty on tests of Etiquette, Con, Bargain and Leadership. The Bubbles last for

1d6 days.
6 Lice

Somewhere along the way, you have become home to a particularly fertile family

of lice and you are now crawling with the things, causing you to itch and scratch

day and night.  You can ignore it in an emergency, but it does make sleeping

difficult - you can only gain  1 point of STAMINA per night of sleep whilst

suffering from lice, which lasts for 1d6 days.

Unbeknownst to you a sneaky goblin infiltrator has been lurking here, waiting for a victim. As you approach it leaps from its cover to attack you! You must make an Awareness Skill roll, to see if you are surprised on the first round of combat. After that, it is a straight fight to the death - if you survive, you may move on to your next encounter.
C11 Burning House
Passing by a group of wooden dwellings, you hear a commotion and shouting voices. A moment later the smell of smoke hits you - one of the houses has caught fire! A woman stands outside trying to beat at the flames with a broom and a child is dashing off in search of water. A few people have stopped to look and are wondering what to do.  What do you do?
● Walk on by. This isn’t a problem you are interested in. Move on to your next encounter.
● Try and rouse other people to help fight the fire.
Make a Leadership skill roll, if successful you round up a chain-gang to bring water and put out the fire.
You are rewarded with a hearty meal (eat it now or add one to your provisions).
● Dive in and attack the fire yourself; every round you must roll against Dodge skill or take one point of damage. If you survive 6 rounds of firefighting you have put it out almost single handedly. As a reward the householder gives you a family heirloom; a silver pendant cast in the shape of a fox with a piece of amber for an eye. It is a pre8y piece of jewellery, worth 5gp if you want to sell it.
C12 Mass Brawl!
You were lost in your thoughts for once and had barely noticed a commotion starting in the people nearby. Something about cabbages and a goat perhaps? You have no time to find out as you are startled by the whoosh of half-brick as it passes within an inch of your face. Suddenly very awake you realise that whatever the argument was, it has descended into a mass brawl, with people swinging fists, clubs, chairs or whatever else comes to hand - you see a plump washerwoman give someone a hard crack to the side of the head with her chamberpot and duck just in time to avoid getting covered by its contents. You have seconds to decide what to do!
●This is madness! You look around for a quiet spot and start to duck and dive your way towards it. Test against your Dodge three times. Each time you fail, you take one point of STAMINA damage as you get clunked by a fist or foot. Once you have made the tests you have successfully wriggled your way into a hiding spot and can wait until the brawl ends.
● Wahey! This is what you’ve been looking for - you enthusiastically join in with the violence, swinging left right and centre with a huge grin plastered on your face. The brawl is fought as if it was a single creature with SKILL 8, using a Club as its damage type. It has no STAMINA score (injured participants crawl off) but keep track of how much damage you do each round. You must fight for six rounds before it dissipates - if you do more damage to the brawl than it has done to you, everyone is highly impressed and your next Con or Leadership roll gains a +2 bonus.
● Someone could get killed over cabbages? You let out a mighty roar and and bellow at them demanding they come to their senses and stop fighting. Make a
Leadership or Law roll. If you succeed, the crowd puts down its weapons and skulks off. Gain +1 to your next Leadership roll due to newfound confidence. If you fail, you are subject to a barrage of objects - take 1d6 points of STAMINA damage as you flee - move to a new location on your map.

You were taking a moment to yourself whilst standing in a shady corner, looking around at the bustle and hurry of the streets when you notice another figure also standing in the shadows, observing the crowd. Curious about this you move a little closer to get a better look.
As you close in, your curiosity increases - they appear to be armed and something about their posture disturbs you. As you mull this over and their cowled head whips around, revealing the twisted features of a hobgoblin! It must be here spying out a place to raid! With a rasping hiss the hobgoblin leaps to attack you, as the nearby townsfolk sca8er in fright.
Special: The Hobgoblin Spy wants to escape rather than fight to the death. If it is reduced below 5
STAMINA it will attempt to flee. It is fleet of foot and agile, so it will clamber over the rooftops and walls to get away.
If you wish to pursue it, you must make a Climbing skill roll for each round of pursuit to keep up with the

A cry of ‘Gangway! Gangwaaaay!’ startles you into turning around just in time to see a young man lose control of his horse which throws its rider and bolts, straight towards you! If you don’t take action it will surely crash into you at high speed.
● Try to get out of the way - you can use your Dodge,
Jump or Acrobatics skill to hurl yourself to one side before you are trampled. If you fail the test, you are struck by the horse and bowled along the cobbles, suffering 1d6 points of STAMINA damage.
● Try to grab the reins! You can use either Animal
Lore or Ride skill as you attempt to control the beast.
If you succeed, you manage to grab hold of it and rein it in. Gain +1 to your next Leadership skill roll as the locals applaud your bravery. If you fail, the horse is not impressed and knocks you flying - suffer 1d6 points of STAMINA damage.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 127 C15 Wrestling Contest
A large group of peasants and townsfolk has gathered in a doughnut shaped crowd around something that is causing them to cheer and shout in excitement. Getting closer you can see that in the middle a wrestling match is taking place, with the two competitors rolling about in dirt grunting and heaving as they try to gain an advantage.
There seems to be a referee in charge of it and around the edge of the ring - which has no rope to mark it - you can see frantic be8ing activity taking place. You note that there are a couple of Watchmen in the crowd, enjoying the spectacle, so you think it’s probably not against the local laws.
As the contest comes to an end with one man slapping the ground in submission, the referee goes around se8ling the bets and calling out to the crowd asking for challengers. It looks like you could step up if you want to fight?
If you choose to fight, a greasy man explains the rules: you will need to be unarmoured and leave your weapons to one side. No magic of any kind is tolerated. You fight five ‘rounds’ that last one minute each, though only one SKILL roll is made for each round.
Use Brawling skill if you have it. Both fighters are unarmoured and use the Unarmed damage table.
Record STAMINA damage separately to normal damage, it is temporary fatigue and can be recovered by resting for a few minutes between bouts. If you are reduced to zero STAMINA you have been choked
(knocked) out and lose, you will recover a few minutes later with a sore head as your only reward.
First Challenge: ‘Dirty’ Hans. SKILL 6 STAMINA 7.
At the start each ‘round’ roll a 1d6 - on a 1 or 2 ‘Dirty’
Hans has grabbed you in a delicate spot (a big ‘oooh’ from the crowd) and the pain causes you a -2 penalty to your SKILL for that round. If you win, you get a purse of 5gp as reward and can move onto the next fight.
Second Challenge: ‘Knuckles’ O’Reilly. SKILL 6
STAMINA 8. ‘Knuckles’ likes to go for the uppercut.
If you lose a round to him, it means he has caught you square on the chin with a hard right hand and take an extra point of damage to your STAMINA in addition to the amount rolled. If you defeat ‘Knuckles’ you receive a purse of 10gp and can challenge Borkin.
Final Challenge: ‘Brickhead’ Borkin. SKILL 7
STAMINA 9. As well as being natural sprinters, the low centre of gravity and general toughness of
Dwarves makes them excellent grapplers.
Each ‘round’ you fight Borkin, roll 1d6. On a 1,2 or 3
Borkin has headbu8ed you in the guts causing one point of STAMINA damage and -1 to SKILL due to nausea. The nausea penalty lasts for the whole contest and adds up! If you defeat this champion, you get a purse of 15gp, a massive cheer from the crowd and +1 to your next two Leadership rolls in this settlement.
You can of course simply watch the contest and take no part. In which case, move on to your next encounter.

You must fight both of them at once. If you defeat one, you may make a test against your Con skill - if you succeed the other cu8hroat flees. If you fail the test he will stay and try to avenge his fallen accomplice.
If you don’t wish to fight, you can try (after the first round) to pay them off. Make a Bargain skill roll, with a bonus of one for every extra gold piece you are willing to offer - if you succeed you pay them 2d6 gold pieces (plus whatever you offered as a bribe) and they decide to take their ill go8en gains and slink back into the shadows.

Cries of ‘help!’ and ‘save us!’ alert you to a nearby commotion. It appears a fire sprite has travelled from the elemental plane of fire to burn whatever it can find, which at the moment includes people’s hats, hair and houses.
The sprite is leaping nimbly from rooftop to rooftop and raining down small firebolts on the peasants and their dwellings. People are caught between diving into cover to avoid getting scorched, or getting buckets and water to put out the fires that are starting to take hold on the roofs and timbers. This could become a very dangerous situation! What do you do?

● Rush to help - the sprite is hard to reach without a ranged weapon or spell, and you must pass a test against your Jump skill to reach it. If you fail the test you have a -2 penalty to your combat SKILL roll as it dances away from your reach. The sprite is angered by your interference and will launch a fiery bolt at you every time you succeed in hi8ing it. Should you defeat the sprite the grateful people give you 1d6gp as a reward.

Acid Touch
A8acking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Special: If this attack hits, it sprays acid on to you, causing 3 points of damage. Armour protects from this but at a cost - for each point of damage your armour absorbs, you will need to spend one gold piece repairing it or suffer a -1 penalty to your armour rolls until you do so.
The touch of chaos is upon the land, even in civilised places, twisting life into new and strange forms. Here it has found a host in a colony of slime moulds and grown into a hungry, dangerous beast.
The Ravenous Slime at first appears to be a large pile of trash - pieces of wood, leaves, scraps of clothing, the bones of some unfortunate animal and so on but as you approach it lurches up and slithers rapidly towards you, sending out long tentacle feelers that are dripping with acid - it means to devour you! You must fight it or end up as its next meal.

A8acking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Ski8ering hideously from its hiding place comes a monstrosity straight out of your nightmares - a leathery, eight legged hunting machine with venom dripping from its fangs.
This one must have crept into the city and found a place where it can hide and prey on anyone unfortunate enough to come by its lair. You will be doing everyone a favour if you can dispatch it. In addition to the normal damage from the bite, it will inject you with venom if it hits. Test against your LUCK or become poisoned.
Each dose of poison reduces your SKILL by 1 for one hour. This adds up - if your SKILL is reduced to zero you will be paralysed...and your fate is not a pre8y one as the spider devours you.
If you defeat the Giant Spider you can attempt to cut out its venom glands - it is a tricky task that requires you to pass an Animal Lore skill test, but if you succeed you may sell the glands for 10gp or use them to coat your weapons with a poison that does 1 additional point of damage each time you hit for the duration of one combat, or can coat 10 arrows or crossbow bolts for the same effect.

These little demon worshipping terrors are found throughout Titan, hiding in any dark place such as an abandoned cellar or the sewers of a city. They are usually found in large groups but in this case you have stumbled on a pair that are out foraging or scouting away from their tribe. They are vicious but fearful. In the first round they will shoot with their bows - they are very skilled and gain a +2 on their combat rolls with a bow - but in the next round they will try to flee. If you wish to, you can pursue and fight them or if you would rather not, you can let them scu8le off back to the holes they crept out of.

It is perhaps embarrassing and certainly un-Characteric to find oneself in combat with a bush, but it appears that you will have to fight this shrubbery or perish!
You had mistaken it for a normal, if very healthy looking piece of hedgerow before you came too close and were startled to find it taking on the form of two leafy bears and lunging their twigs and branches toward you! In fact, you must make an Awareness skill test - if you fail, you are so surprised that they automatically hit you on the first round of combat.
After that you can choose to stay and slay the arboreal terror - you’ll be doing everyone a favour - or simply take a few steps back out of its range. If you back off, it grasps for you a few times before transforming back into an ordinary looking plant. It’s strange nature means that it takes no damage from arrows or bolts and reduces damage from stabbing weapons, like spears, by one point per hit.
If you do fight and defeat the
Leaf Beast you can take a cu8ing from its stem which, due to its magical nature, is worth 5gp.

Lurching from their hiding spot in a nearby alleyway are two rough men dressed in shabby clothing with a collection of interesting tattoos and scars on their faces. They are clearly coming towards you and you notice with alarm that one of them is carrying a net and manacles!
Although slavery is generally illegal, the laws are rarely enforced and men such as these are employed to drag the unfortunate away to a life of servitude in some form of hard labour. Most end up deep in a mine or shackled to the oars of a pirate ship. Your only way to avoid this is to fight.
Special: The first time one of the Slave Takers hits you, they will do no damage but instead wrap you in a weighted net. This causes you a penalty of -2 to your

These crab-like creatures, covered in hard plates of bone, infest the catacombs beneath the city.
Occasionally they will venture out onto the surface in the hunt for a tasty meal. The usual way of discovering their presence is the remains of the domestic animals they have eaten or finding holes chewed through the walls near any food store. They may be small (about coconut sized) but they are extremely vicious and good at ambushing. Their first attack will always cause 1 point of stamina damage as they scurry in for a bite.

A8acking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Orcs infest the dark corners of every kingdom and nowhere is entirely safe from their attacks. It is a custom amongst many orc tribes to send a young warrior out to sneak into enemy (usually human) territory to cause chaos of one kind or another - stealing, fighting and slave-taking are the common reasons. The orcs move by night and rely on stealth and intimidation to avoid detection. This one has decided - perhaps unwisely - that you would be a good victim. Pulling back its hood and letting out a snarl of hatred, the orc gives you no option but to fight!

Chapter 4 - Settlements 133 C27 Swarm of Rats
What begins as a pleasant noise, like the rustling of leaves in a breeze, rapidly turns to horror as you hear the squeaking and scratching of thousands of tiny claws - a swarm of rats has been driven out of their nest and are surging towards you, their eyes gleaming with maddened hunger. You need to do something or risk being overrun!
● Try to get out of their way: You may make a test against either your Climb or Acrobatics skills to make a leap to safety and cling on to some nearby surface whilst the swarm passes.
● Do you have a torch to hand or some means of making fire? If so you can try to ward off the swarm by using their fear of fire to keep them at bay. If you choose this option, test against your Animal Lore skill to see if you can pull it off. If you succeed the swarm goes around your barrier.
● Fight them! You can’t hope to kill them all as they pass, but maybe you can defend yourself. Make a test against your weapon skill but with a -3 penalty due to the number of opponents. If you succeed you have managed to keep them at bay as they pass.
● Stand very still and hope for the best: You may test your LUCK to see if the rats simply decide you are not worth it (maybe your feet don’t smell too tasty?).
If you succeed you close your eyes and pray and when you open them again the swarm has passed.
If you fail to avoid the swarm by some means you are bi8en, chewed and gnawed on - take 1d3+1 points of
STAMINA damage and roll on the diseases table (Table 4.3.2 Diseases).

A8acking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Perhaps it was a maggot laid on the body of a chaos warped beast, or maybe it drank a sip from the spilled liquids of a potion maker's workbench, for whatever reason a fly has grown to horrific size. As big as a crow and dripping diseased fluids from its finger like proboscis, this foul creature buzzes through the city looking for warm blood to slurp on. The Monstrous
Fly is not dangerous in combat - it is too large and clumsy to dart out of the way like its tiny brethren - but instead relies on stealth and surprise.
To avoid the attack you must make a test against your
Awareness skill. If you succeed you can fight the fly as a normal combatant to avoid its bite. If you fail the test (or if the fly beats you in combat) it swoops in and latches onto you for a moment, sucking on your blood. This causes one point of STAMINA damage and injects you with its filth. You must test against your LUCK or contract shivering disease: within minutes you feel chilled to your bones and start shivering as if you were naked on a mountaintop.
Your maximum STAMINA is reduced by one and your Combat and Movement skills suffer a -1 penalty.
The disease lasts for 1d6 days and each day your maximum STAMINA falls by one and you suffer a further -1 penalty to your Combat and Movement skills. If you survive, your health returns after a full night's rest and all penalties are removed. You may want to go and see a healer…
After one bite the fly will buzz off to seek a new victim, though you can try to swipe at it as it leaves for the sake of stopping its horrible work - you’ll be doing everyone a favour.

It seems as if something is watching you intently then, very suddenly, a creature forms out of the air in front of you as if stepping through from some other plane of reality. You get a glimpse of sharp claws and teeth and eyes burning red with rage before it attacks! The chaos horror is an amalgamation of different beasts, dredged from your subconscious - the head of a bear, the talons of an eagle and the body of a huge spider for example. All that really ma8ers is that it is full of fury. The beast draws its strength from you, so the difficulty of the fight will depend on how powerful a Character you are.

C30 Tomb Mist
At first you ignore the fine mist that seems to be creeping up from the ground but as it thickens you start to worry. With alarming speed your vision is obscured by a freezing fog that leaves you fumbling in a whiteout with the temperature plummeting - you start to shiver. Clearly, this is no ordinary mist, but something malicious and predatory.
You must test your Awareness skill to escape from the Tomb Mist. Each round that you spend inside the mist, you lose 2 points of STAMINA as the cold leeches away your life. You must succeed three times with your Awareness skill (make one test each round) to find a way out. You may also test your LUCK to escape - if successful you stumble out of the mists in the same round, disorientated but alive.
There is no way for you to fight the Tomb Mist and even as you leave you see that the tendrils of vapour are starting to sink back into the ground, perhaps awaiting another victim.
Special: If your settlement is in a particularly hot climate, the Tomb Mist is a swirling cloud of ash that burns you for 2 points of STAMINA damage until you escape it.

## Settlement Map Encounters

The map generated at the start of exploring a city includes the major landmarks and streets, but does not include details of every little courtyard, side alley or unusual building that you might find as you navigate your way around. On the encounter tables, you might get a result which adds a new feature to your map. These should be marked on in some way, as they are (usually) permanent features that can be revisited later.
To be clear that means once you have recorded that you have found a Latrine (M9) near to the Garbage
Heap, you can return there any time you are at that location to use the facilities.
As you build up your settlement you can record details on your map or on a Settlement Details Sheet
- see 4.5 for an example.
Unlike other encounters Map encounters can only be rolled a certain number of times for each settlement - a city can only have so many armourers before the local economy starts to suffer. The number that can be found is given next to the description. This is the suggested number for a city, you can add more if your city is particularly large. For a town or village, the maximum is one of each encounter per settlement.
If you roll the same result at a later visit to a location, it simply means you have ended up passing by the same feature again.
Bargaining: Many of the map encounters are shops where you can buy or sell goods and services. Unless the description says otherwise, you can attempt to make a Bargain skill roll to alter the price. A successful Bargain skill roll reduces the price by one quarter, a failed roll increases it by one quarter
(round to the nearest gold piece). For example, if your
Character is trying to buy a Long Sword at the
Weaponsmith (M14). The normal price in a city is 30gp (as listed in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebook). With a successful skill roll that can be reduced to 22gp, but if you fail the roll the price increases to 38gp. Remember to apply the modifiers for Social Rank (chapter 7) and other modifiers as described in the core rulebook.
Temporary skill bonuses and penalties: Many of the encounters give you an opportunity to gain a bonus to a future skill use, though often at the risk of suffering a penalty. Such bonuses and penalties last until you use them (usually by making a skill test) or leave that settlement for a day or more. Remember that if you want to retire to an inn or drinking den to
‘wait it out’, you have to pay the cost of food and lodging.

M1 Quiet Crossroads Suggested Maximum number: 6
Wandering through the streets you come across a quiet space where several roads meet. In the centre there is a water pump next to a stone bench, with a weathered, vine covered statue behind it. Make an
Awareness skill roll; If successful you notice that there seems to be a map carved into the base of the statue.
● If you noticed the map you may study it for a while attempting to memorise the layout of streets closeby; gain a +2 bonus to your next City Lore skill roll. You may also stop and eat a meal here.
● If you didn’t notice the map, you may stop and eat a meal, but there is nothing else to be done here.
Carry on to your next encounter. You may re-roll to spot the map on one visit each day.
M2 Small Well Suggested Maximum number: 6
You come across a circular structure of worked stones covered over with vines and some small bushes. On closer inspection you realise it is a forgotten well.
Clearing away some of the leaves  and brambles you can see that the well has water inside.
● You aren’t thirsty at the moment, so you note the location and move on. If you pass through this location again you can make use of the well.
● Do you have a rope and bucket? If so, you can make use of the well. The water is crystal clear, cool and delightfully refreshing. Add +1 LUCK point for your fortunate discovery (only gain this once for each well). You can also use the water to wash yourself clean, if you are in need of it.
M3 Collapsing Ground!
Maximum number: Treat as Catacombs Entrance, see
Settlement Location description. Ground is repaired after 1d6 days.
Spying a quiet alleyway you decide that it is probably a shortcut to your destination, and nip down it. This cut-through is a bit ragged and untended with many plants pushing up past the cobbles and piles of rubbish to either side. Just as you are regretting your decision there is a cracking noise, followed by a rumble which is followed by a yelping shout - from you - as the ground beneath your feet gives way! You must react immediately.
● A8empt to dive forward across the pit. You must make a SKILL roll using the Jump Skill or test your
LUCK. If successful you may continue with your adventure, if you fail you fall down into the pit, suffering 2d6 points of damage. You may not use the
Acrobatics skill to reduce damage as you have already tried to jump.
● Accept your fate and try to minimise the damage.
You suffer 2d6 points of damage which can be halved if you make an Acrobatics skill test or test your
LUCK. If you wish to leave the pit, make a Climb skill test - failure results in a further 1d3 points of damage as you slither back down.
Either way, once the dust and stones se8le and you pick yourself up, you can see what caused the collapse. A large pipe - possibly an unused sewer  - has fallen in upon itself, maybe sapped by the endless tunnelling of rats. The rubble hasn’t completely blocked it and you can see the pipe continues into the darkness. If you so wish, you may use this as an entrance to the Catacombs (start generating a
Catacombs map from this point) or you may ignore this and continue with your adventure. Mark this on your map as a Catacombs entrance.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 137 M4 Catacombs Entrance
Maximum number:  See description of Catacombs entrance as a Settlement Location.
Trying to navigate the maze-like city you have become a little bit lost and wandered into a rougher part of town. The streets here are dirtier, the houses more ramshackle and the people dressed in rags and patched up clothing. You begin to feel uneasy when you notice a large group of young men coming along the road, mu8ering amongst themselves, banging sticks and clubs against the house walls as they go.
Concerned, you slip down a narrow side alley that is choked with rubbish. There is half a barrel leaning up against a wall and you duck down behind it hoping the mob will pass you by. Your plan seems to be working and as the last of the men pass by you get ready to move on, when you feel the ground shifting beneath you. There is no time to react as a large hole opens up in the ground and you crash downward through a cloud of dirt, cobble stones and rotten wood. The fall is thankfully not long and more of a slither across some hidden slope.
Coughing and spluttering you sit up and take a moment to check yourself, before looking around at your new surroundings. The hole you made is letting in enough light to see by. It appears you have slid down an old chimney funnel - of which only half is standing - into what must once have been the main room of a house, all now buried under the cities’ current surface level. Around you, covered in dust and rubble you can make out some walls, a dirt floor, broken pieces of furniture and a doorway. There is no door, just a rectangle of darkness. For a moment you are sure you hear something moving around, a sort of scuffling, scratchy sound that sends shivers down your spine. Feeling uneasy you draw your weapon and consider your choices. You could climb back out, but now that you are here maybe you should explore some more? What do you do?
● Mark the location on your map but move on for now. You can return to this location to use this entrance at a later time during this visit to this area.
However, if you leave this place for 1d6+3 days the locals will have sealed it up again.
● Drawing your weapon and readying yourself, you slide down into the darkness to explore. You should now refer to the Catacombs Entrance location in section 4.1 to help you create a mini-dungeon.
M5 Quiet Fishing Spot Suggested Maximum number: 4
You’ve found a quiet spot down by the edge of a pool, where the roots of a willow tree provide a natural seat and tall reeds shield you from prying eyes. If you wish to, you can sit here for a while and enjoy the serenity as a break from adventuring.
If you have a fishing rod or net you can spend half a day trying to catch something. Make a Fishing skill roll with a +3 bonus, if you succeed you catch 1d6 meals worth of fish. If you fail, all you recover is a muddy old boot.
In addition, this secluded spot would be an ideal place to bathe - when was the last time you got yourself clean?
Special: If your settlement is in a hot, dry climate you can replace the quiet fishing spot with a spot where you can use your Hunting skill to capture particularly delicious lizards, though you cannot bathe here.

M6 Forgo=en Cellar Suggested Maximum number: 5
You notice a rotting wooden door that is almost completely obscured by a heavy layer of creepers and vines. Trying the handle, you find it is stiff but not locked. You push the vines aside and open the door - moving slightly into the space before you reveals a vaulted chamber made from well cut stone. The chamber stretches away and you guess it is about 60’ long, but only 15’ wide. It is cool and dry, which has helped preserve the shelving that lines both walls, leaving only an unobstructed 5’ wide path down the middle of the room. Sadly the contents of the shelves have not fared well. Broken bo8les and smashed casks li8er the floor, making a little crunching noise as you take a step forward. It is as if a great gust of wind has blown through here, hurling everything movable up into the air then slamming it into the cut stone floor. The room has a sweet but not unpleasant smell of spilt wine still lingering after who knows how many years of abandonment. What do you do?
● Seems like you are very late to this party - You close the door and move on with your adventure.
● Moving carefully amongst the broken glass and cask fragments, I’ll search the room. If you have a torch to light (it’s dark in here) you can make an
Awareness roll with a -3 penalty. If you succeed you find a preserved bo8le of fine wine. You can drink it, or if you keep it you can offer it to someone you encounter to gain +2 on your Bribery Skill roll.
● A sudden, irresistible, thought comes to you.
Pu8ing your shoulder to the side of one of the shelves you give it a hard shove - make a Strength skill roll - and watch with glee as the entire row of shelving smashes into each other and topples over. Enjoying yourself you repeat the trick with the other side. As the noise fades you realise you might have alerted someone…..roll on Table 5.6 Random Monster
Encounters. (if you fail the Strength roll, you just get a small bruise to your shoulder and your pride and should move sheepishly onto your next encounter).
M7 Abandoned Shack Suggested Maximum number: 6
With ro8ed beams that creak ominously in the slightest breeze, patchwork boards pierced by so many holes that it is no warmer inside than outside and a roof with enough tiles missing to ensure that hardly a patch of the dirt floor is kept dry from the rain, this lean-to shack has clearly been abandoned and left to decay.
Still, it is tucked up in a quiet corner of another building and out of sight from the street, so it is unlikely you will be disturbed here.
● You may rest here if you wish, without having to pay for accommodation. It is not entirely peaceful and you only recover 3 points of STAMINA instead of the usual 4.
● You may sit here for a while, clean your weapons, tidy your pack or eat your rations. You can hear the noises of the city around you but no one comes to disturb your camp.
● You can’t miss out on this opportunity for wanton destruction. Taking your weapon in your hands, you start knocking chunks of wood and board away - a savage delight fills you and after a few sweaty minutes of hacking and bashing, you have reduced this hovel to sticks and dust. Brushing yourself down and catching your breath, you survey your handiwork one last time before continuing with your adventures. Is ‘Destroyer of Shacks’ your new nickname? In any case, remove this place from your map.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 139 M8 Shrine Suggested Maximum number: 8
You notice a small shrine has been erected here, no bigger than a window, built into the stonework of a building. A carving of a religious scene forms the main part of the shrine and it is decorated with candles and iconographs - wooden boards crudely painted with sacred images. It is clearly well tended, but there is nobody about at the moment. Moving closer you can try and discern which god it is dedicated to, and maybe make an offering of prayer.
Firstly roll 2d6; if you get a total of 11 or 12 the shrine is dedicated to the god you follow and you can pray here once each day to restore one point of STAMINA.
If not, make a Religious Lore Skill roll. If you succeed you have correctly understood the nature of this shrine and can, if you wish, offer a prayer in the correct manner. Roll 1d6 - on a roll of a 5 or 6, the gods smile upon you and restore 1 point of
STAMINA. If you fail the Religious Lore Skill, you are praying to the wrong gods...roll 1d6 - on a roll of a 1 or 2 the gods have noticed your transgression and smite you - lose 1 point of STAMINA.
Once you have found this shrine you may mark it on your map. You may pray here at most once per week.
Specific God: Whilst your settlement or region might be dedicated to a specific god or gods, people and small groups may still erect shrines to other deities.
You can refer to Chapter 7 Political Systems &
Religion, to find out what the dominant religions are and determine which specific god this shrine is dedicated to. If the specific god is one that you are a follower of, you will automatically restore 1 point of
STAMINA by praying here, this can only be done once per day.
M9 Latrine
Suggested Maximum number: 1 per location, ten per city.
Whilst most ‘needs’ are taken care of by finding a quiet spot, some of the more generous nobles, desiring a cleaner and sweeter smelling city, will fund the construction of a public latrine such as this one. Two narrow wooden huts are placed back to back (one for men, one for women) over a pipe leading down into the sewers - or sometimes just into a pit that needs to be dug out from time to time.
That job is done by the surprisingly cheerful looking old man who is sat on a stool in a small wooden booth just by the entrance to the latrine, grinning and nodding at his grateful customers. A bucket and mop are leant up against his booth.  For 2 silver pieces he will sell you a bit of moss or some rags to wipe with, but you can ‘bring your own’ if you want.
Inside the hut there is a single stall, with one long bench against the back wall of the hut and four seats available. The air is foetid and rank, with many flies buzzing here and there. It is best not to look down the hole if you value your sanity, but you can engage in conversation with your bench-fellows. Roll once on the rumours table should you wish to do this.
Every time you use the latrine, you must roll a 1d6 - on a roll of a 1, a Giant Rat is occupying the hut and you must decide if you wish to fight it (see the Giant
Rat encounter C9) or hold on for now. If you do defeat this guardian of the privy, the grateful attendant will waive the usual fee and give you a handful of his softest moss as a reward.

The familiar clang-clonk double beat of metal being worked alerts you to the presence of a smithy some time before you see it. Set back from the main road you see a well ordered workshop built around a forge that, even from this distance, is warming your face.
A pair of blacksmiths, one human and one dwarvish, stand either side of the furnace and are taking turns heating and hammering their respective pieces of work. A dog is lying near the entrance of the workshop, enjoying the heat. As you approach it looks around and barks once before returning its chin to the ground and the blacksmiths both turn to look at you. They are clearly busy, but seem friendly enough. What do you do?
● You have no need of their services at the moment, so you simply nod a greeting and move on. Mark the
Smithy on your map, in case you wish to return here later.
● Both your armour and weapons have seen better days. You ask them what can be done, and in between blows of their hammer they offer you a number of services they can provide. They are very busy, so you may only choose one of these services each day. After you have made your choice and paid, mark the

In addition, if you do attack them you cannot return to this shop and you should remove it from your map.
In your wandering you have come across a shop selling maps. It occupies the ground floor of a modest wood frame house and in the window you can see a number of large maps of various locations in Titan, few of which you recognise.
The door is open and you can dimly see a middle aged woman sat at a desk near the back of the room, she is currently engrossed in a book and has not noticed you. Given your profession this shop might be a very lucky find, so you stop outside to take a closer look. What do you do?
● You prefer to rely on your own skills and wits, so after admiring the goods for a moment longer you move on.
● You enter the shop and talk to the map maker, asking if she has anything in stock that might be of use to you. She offers you a variety of maps, though they aren’t cheap. You can buy maps of this location, or the wilderness. Each map you buy costs 20gp and fills up one inventory slot (they are large and unwieldy) but will give you a +1 on your City Lore or
Region Lore rolls whilst you carry it. Each Settlement or Region requires its own map.
● You move into the shop but after talking to the map maker you realise these goods are way too expensive.
If you wish to, you could use the Sleight of Hand skill to steal a map  - you have noticed one that covers your current location. The maps are not an easy object to conceal quickly so the SKILL check has a -2 penalty. If you succeed, you gain a +1 bonus to City
Lore SKILL checks whilst in this city, but the map does take up one inventory slot. If you fail the check, the enraged map maker bustles you out of her shop whilst calling for the guards, you decide it is time to move on. If you are noticed, you may not return to this shop for 2d6 days.
● You are lost in this settlement and need directions:
For a small fee (5gp) she can direct you to a specific location - you can use this knowledge to choose a specific map encounter at a location of your choice.
The cartographer is quite busy and will only give out detailed directions once each day.

Pushed up against the side of a larger building and indeed taking some shelter from the bigger structure, is an intriguing and well made kiosk. It consists of an open fronted hut under a brightly dyed canvas awning, with several well stocked wooden racks set about it. Si8ing on a tall chair inside the hut is a contented dwarf, puffing on a large clay pipe.
She waves at you and beckons you over to her shop.
It is somewhat unusual to see a kiosk like this away from the marketplace, but you guess this dwarf has struck a deal with the owners of the larger building to let her carry out her trade here. Mark this on your map for future use.
This small store sells food and drink and everyday household items at the prices listed in the AFF guidebook (the ‘General Equipment’ part of the price list), but it doesn’t sell or trade in armour or weapons
- you will need to find a more specialised outlet for
that type of item. After you have bought or sold
(remember to make your Bargain skill rolls if you wish to haggle!) you wave goodbye to the dwarf and continue your travels.

You are ambling along when you notice an intriguing doorway. Steps lead down from street level to a well made wooden door set in a cut stone wall. To either side of the door are small barred windows and above the door on the lintel is nailed a shield with the legend ‘Bogram’s Armour’ etched into it. The door is open so you decide to go down the steps and have a look inside. Peering around the doorway you see a small basement shop containing a number of pieces of armour (firmly a8ached to the walls) and a wooden counter going across the middle of the room.
Behind the counter sits a dwarf, caught in the act of munching on a meat pie. He has dark tanned skin, a very bushy red beard and the build of someone who spends a lot of time working metal, though he looks friendly enough. Behind him are shelves stacked with a variety of types and pieces or armour and shields.
What do you do?
● You have no need of armour at the moment - you apologise for disturbing his dinner and move on.
● You don’t need his goods but decide to talk to him anyway. Feigning an interest in a decorated shield, you strike up a conversation with him. Make an
Etiquette skill roll. If you succeed, the dwarf engages in a long explanation of the local cave system and you gain +2 to your next Underground Lore skill roll. If you fail, the dwarf notices you aren’t going to buy anything and you end up leaving the shop.

Blocking part of the road is a covered wagon, from which spill a variety of spears, swords, maces and so on. As you approach you see a large bald headed man bartering his wares with a couple of peasants. A guard dog - very large and fierce - sits to one side of the weaponsmith, keeping an eye on proceedings as if it were the true owner of this business. It looks as if you are going to have to pass close by in order to move along, so you decide to slow down and have a look at the goods. What do you do?

Against a larger building and by the looks of it leaning heavily on it for support a cylindrical tower has been built. It is not large - only two storeys - but looks cosy rather than ramshackle. Around the base there are a number of clay pots with herbs growing in them, above the open doorway is a wooden sign stating simply ‘Many Curiosities’ and ‘Welcome’ and the faint whiff of pipe smoke is in the air. The room inside is well lit and close to the entrance you can see an older woman, in a well made woollen dress, sat on a wooden stool and holding a clay beaker in her lap.
In her other hand is a book that she is studying intensely. The rest of the room holds a stairway leading both up and down and a large number of shelves, stands and boxes covered in a wide variety of strange objects - many books, but also animal horns, glassware, strange bits of sculpture and many other things. Even more peculiar, you think you caught sight of a large bat-like creature hopping from behind a rack of clothing and up onto a high shelf. What do you do?
● The contents of this shop are weird, unusual and probably dangerous, you have no desire to get tangled up in this sort of thing. Move along to your next encounter.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 145
● Jingling your coin purse to show you could be a customer, you engage the proprietor in conversation.
She is quite happy to chat and the difficulty is sticking to one topic. Make a roll on Table 8.2 Winds of Magic

● It’s possible that she has something in her stock that might be of particular use to you. You ask to have a look around and move around the shop carefully examining the different items. Make a Magic Lore skill roll. If you are successful you find an item  - pick one from the Adventurers guild stock list to purchase if you wish. You may only find one such item here each week, so make a note of it!
● Stealing from a magician is only for the foolhardy, but that is not going to deter you. Entering the shop you make smalltalk whilst looking for an item to pilfer. Firstly, make an Evaluate skill test. If you succeed you have spotted something of value and can try and swipe it - make a Sleight of Hand skill roll. If you succeed you make off with a small item worth 3d6gp. If you fail, her imp was watching you carefully and screeches out an alert! With a curse the magician recites a quick spell and disappears in a puff of smoke whilst the imp swoops into attack. So you must fight two rounds of combat as you head for the door and flee this location before the Watch arrives. You cannot return to this shop for one week.
● A shopful of treasures guarded only by a defenceless woman? This is an opportunity! Looking around to make sure no one is paying a8ention you move into the shop, close the door behind you and move to attack. The magician lets out a scream, drops her book and drink and then disappears in a puff of smoke! Her Imp screeches and swoops to attack.
Resolve the combat as usual. If you survive you can loot some items worth 4d6 gold pieces, but you realise that the sound of combat has been noticed.

M16 Devious Trap
Suggested Maximum number: n/a as they disappear once triggered.
Whilst the city of Khare may be famous for its traps, it is not the only place on Titan where devious tricksters set their snares to catch the unwary. There are as many motivations for this as there are traps; some do it out of spite, some in the hope of profit and others create them simply because they can.
Whatever the reason, coming across a trap can be a very unpleasant experience for an adventurer.
Special: Once the trap has been sprung (deliberately or accidentally) remove it from the map.
You can choose to test against your Trap Knowledge skill instead of any listed for the specific trap. A success indicates that you have avoided the dangerous effects of the trap. You can make a second test against your Trap Knowledge skill in order to deactivate it. If you succeed in this roll you gain 1d6 gold pieces worth of components, but if you fail this second roll you suffer the effects of the trap as your fumblings activate it. Once the trap is activated or disarmed, remove it from the map. You may also test your LUCK to avoid a trap, as usual.

## Table 4.4.2 Traps

2d6 Trap Description 2
Acid Bath: A part of the ground has been rigged to give way, sending you slithering down into an acid

filled stone bath! You can test against your Climb skill with a -3 penalty (the sides are slippery) or plunge into the corrosive liquid and suffer 1d6 points of damage (no Dodge or armour). Each round test Climb

skill at -3 to scrabble back out or suffer a further point of damage. When you get out, roll 1d6 for each

piece of equipment you carry - on a roll of 1 the acid has destroyed it! Only magical items are immune to this. This well concealed trap imposes -2 on Trap Knowledge to spot it.
3
Unstoppa-Ball: A neatly hidden pressure plate releases a heavy metal ball down a chute and straight into you! Test against your Dodge skill with a -3 penalty or take 3+1d6 points of damage and you are knocked down. The ball is worth 1d6 gp but occupies three equipment slots if you want to carry it. This trap is

well made and using Trap Knowledge has a -2 penalty.
4
Vortex of Magic: When activated by your presence a concealed rune unleashes a vortex of wild magic.
You are teleported to a random location (roll or drop a dice onto your map to find out where if you are

in a city or dungeon). The magic also mangles you for 1d6 points of damage which cannot be prevented

with armour or Dodge skill. If you have the Second Sight skill you may test against it to spot the rune

before it activates. If you attempt to use Trap Knowledge you must take a -3 penalty due to the unusual

nature of the trap.
5
Poisoned Dart: A wicked person has secreted a spring loaded poisoned dart in a gap in the nearby stonework. If you spot it (by making an Awareness skill test) you are able to jump out of the way as the

dart whips past you. If you fail the skill test, you are stung by the dart and suffer 3 points of STAMINA

damage as the poison sets your body on fire.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 147 2d6 Trap Description 6
Chaos Rune: A magic user has inscribed a dangerous rune trap in this area - test against your Second

Sight skill. If you succeed, you notice its emanations and are able to move carefully past it. If you fail, the rune is triggered and you are drained of 1d6 MENTAL points. If you do not have MENTAL points, you will

feel a slight chilling but suffer no other effects.
7
Pit Trap: Amazingly, someone has dug out a pit without anyone noticing their work. Maybe they did it

at night. In any case, as the ground beneath you gives way, you must test your Jump skill. A success

means you have leapt clear, failure means you drop a few feet onto ragged shards of rusty metal, taking 1d6 points of STAMINA damage as a result. You may climb out relatively easily.
8
Spore Bag: A pressure plate has been rigged here, which when activated punctures a concealed bag of

noxious spores which fill this area with a choking cloud. Test against your Acrobatics skill. If you succeed you manage to dive and roll out of the cloud before you are affected, if you fail you take a lungful of

spores and suffer a racking cough for the rest of the day - you have -1 penalty to your SKILL until you

have rested overnight.
9
Drop stone: Your movements see you blundering upon a tripwire which has released a large stone block from above you. Test your Dodge skill. If you succeed, you have quickly sidestepped the block and are

unharmed (if dusty). If you fail, a hefty clunk onto your head leaves you reeling - suffer 1d6 points of

STAMINA damage. If you wear a metal helmet, you take 1 point of damage.
10
Spray of Acid: When touched a disguised lever sets off a spring loaded piston that shoots a spray of

strong acid over you! Test your Acrobatics skill. If you succeed you manage to dive out of the way before the acid soaks you. If you fail, the burning liquid causes you 1 point of STAMINA damage and also

degrades your armour. Your Armour rolls have a -1 penalty until you can pay a suitable merchant to

repair it.
11
Spiked Stick: A spiked length of wood has been rigged with a tripwire to swing out and impale you. You may test against your Dodge skill to avoid it. It is a crude trap and causes only one point of damage.
12
Broken Trap: Someone has already fallen victim to this trap - if you have Trap Knowledge you can

scavenge 2d6 gp worth of machinery, otherwise you move carefully past.

M17 Upwelling of Magic
Suggested Maximum number: 3 at any one time.
For those without the Second Sight skill, this spot will appear as a basically normal part of the settlement - perhaps they will experience a slight tingling sensation or wondering why the light seems to be brighter - but to those who are magically inclined, it is clear that something interesting is happening here.
Magical energy seems to be flowing from the ground in what appears to be a skyward reaching stream of scintillating lights. It is not clear what is causing this, but if you are inclined it is possible you could make use of this upwelling of magic, harvesting it to replenish your own reserves, though it may be risky.
What do you do?
● You push your hands into the stream and relax your mind, ignoring the looks you are getting from passersby, as you try to a8une to the energy and redirect it into yourself. Make a test against your
Magic Lore skill. If successful you can restore 1d6
Magic points. If you fail, you suffer one point of
STAMINA damage as the raw magical energy reacts to your interference by burning you!
● This is a fascinating natural phenomenon, but for the time being you will ignore it and move on Special: The upwelling of magic ‘contains’ 20 Magic points worth of energy.
After that is depleted it will disappear.
It will also disappear after one week, fading into nothingness.
M18 Magic Door Suggested Maximum number: 4
Upon a section of wall, someone (or something?) has inscribed runes of power, creating a magical door that can move you instantaneously across the city.
Characteres that have the Second Sight skill will automatically notice the door - it appears as a series of gently glowing runes in the shape of an arched entrance which seems to surround a slowing spinning vortex of shadows. Without this ability, you must make an Awareness skill test with a penalty of
-4 to notice the subtle markings. If you fail to spot it,
mark it on your map anyway. You may retake the test each time you pass through this location.
Finding the door doesn’t mean you understand how to use it. Test against Magic Lore skill to see if you can decipher the runes. If you fail the test, you may come back and try again once per week to see if you can
‘open’ the portal. If you succeed you know how to activate the door, but not where it leads and to find out you must step through!
Drop or roll a dice onto your map - the nearest location is where you ‘exit’ the door, into a quiet alleyway or corner where no one is surprised to see you pop into existence.
The door is NOT two-way. After the first time you have used it successfully, make a note of where it ‘exits’ so you can use it again in the future.
Each time you use the door, there is a chance that the winds of magic will whip you away to an unexpected location. Roll 2d6 - on a result of 2 you appear outside the settlement and should move to the nearest gate to re- enter. On a result of 12 you appear in the city but in the wrong place - drop or roll a dice onto your map to see where it is.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 149 M19 Rogues Cubby Suggested Maximum number: 5
In order to spot this feature you need to make an
Awareness test with a -3 penalty. If you fail to spot it, mark it on your map anyway. You may retake the test each time you pass through this location.
If you succeed, you have noticed that part of a building has been carefully and subtly modified to create an alcove like hiding space, complete with holes set at just the right height to peek through.
Judging by the cobwebs and dust the cubby is not often used and if your mission requires to watch or monitor an area, you can slide into the space and observe the settlement gaining a +2 on your
Awareness or Sneaking skill rolls for this location.
However, each time you use the cubby you should roll a 1d6 - on the result of a 1 you have disturbed a
Hobgoblin Spy (encounter C13) and must fight them!
M20 Crumbling Watchtower Suggested Maximum number: 3
In ages past, perhaps as part of an older city wall, a watchtower was built here. It has largely been built onto and incorporated into other newer structures, but parts of it still remain including the stone stairs and eyrie (the roof has disappeared completely). You could, if you wish, climb up and use it to observe the nearby streets though it probably isn’t entirely safe. If you want to ascend, you must pass a Climb skill test with a +3 bonus (failure means you can’t find a way to get up). At the top, you can survey the area and gain a +2 on your next City Lore, Awareness or
Hunting roll. If you do this roll a 1d6 - on the result of a 1, part of the tower crumbles under your weight and you must test against your Jump skill or suffer 1d6 points of STAMINA damage as you plummet to the ground in a cloud of masonry. If this happens remove the Crumbling Watchtower from your map, as it is now too damaged to be used as a lookout position.
M21 Forgo=en Stash
Suggested Maximum number: Disappears when found, so no maximum
Caught in a daydream, you are surprised to find yourself staring at a small pile of masonry and old timber wedged into the corner of a nearby building.
Tilting your head from side to side you realise that there is something - a leather bag perhaps - hidden underneath. It is clear from the cobwebs and weeds that stretch across the pile that it has been concealed for some time.
After a quick check to make sure no one is watching, you delve in and drag out the container...but what does it contain?
Roll a 1d6 to see what you have found:
1 = nothing, the bag is empty
2 = roll once on Everyday Items treasure table,
3-4 = coins worth 3d6gp in total
5-6 = coins worth 5d6gp in total.

A8ached to the corner of a larger structure is the strangest little building you have ever seen. Although clearly made of brick, tile and wood in appearance it would seem to have grown onto it’s neighbour like tumour or parasite. There are no straight lines or logic to its construction except that the door is, as usual, next to the ground. For all that it does not feel threatening or dangerous, more like the prank of an unhinged architect. You move closer to get a better look and now you can see inside - there is a fireplace, shelves full of intriguing knick-knacks, a table and chairs in one of which sits a bright eyed elf that is spinning an orb of light in his hand. He sees you and beckons you over.  What do you do?
● This is too strange for you. Move along to your next encounter.
● Approach  the elf and greet him. He explains that his name is Tym Po Nang and he is a travelling sorcerer. He has set up his ‘shop’ here (with full permission he is at pains to add) in order to trade and to teach. It’s rare to meet an elf or a sorcerer and you stop to have a chat with him. Make a roll on Table 8.2
Winds of Magic Rumours & Events and make an
Etiquette skill test. If you succeed you draw him into a conversation about the settlement and you can add
+2 to your next City Lore roll.
● Nodding and greeting the elf you come into the building and your eyes light up at the possibilities for larceny. You may try to pinch something - make a test against Sleight of Hand as an opposed roll against the sorcerer, who has Awareness skill of 8. If you succeed you have pilfered a spell component worth 3d6 gp. If you fail, Tym Po Nang notices and with a snarl blasts you with a spell of his own devising - you disappear from this location and reappear at the Jail location.
You must roll on the Lawbreaker table immediately, and may not revisit the sorcerers home for a month.

You smell this building before you see it. A sharp smell causes you to sneeze and leaves your throat feeling scorched, as you pull up your cloak to cover your mouth and nose you spot a low wooden framed building with what appear to be scorch marks do8ed across its walls. The smell is coming from a bright green liquid that appears to have just been emptied out of a window and is seeping into the mud of the sidewalk. The person who slopped it out is a round- faced man, noticeably missing his eyebrows and most of his hair, who gives you a cheery wave as you pass by. You can see inside the building there are racks of vials and ceramic pots and, surprisingly, a large selection of herbs neatly po8ed up and dangling from a trellis. What do you do?
● You’ve no need of a potion or salve today, so you nod to the man and move on.
● Moving over you stop and talk to the alchemist. He is friendly but strange - too much time inhaling fumes has left him with a wandering mind. After an hour talking to him you can add +1 to your next Lore roll
(any type of Lore except City Lore).
● Alchemists often have a secret stock. Make a test against either your Bribery or Con skill, to convince him to bring it out. If you succeed you can purchase a vial of acid (10gp, does 1d6 points of damage to one target and 1d3 points to all those adjacent to the target, use Thrown skill to use) or a vial of poison
(20gp, increase weapon damage by 2 for one combat or coats 10 bolts or arrows to the same effect). If you fail the Bribery or Con test, he is very offended by your enquiries and asks you to leave. You can only access the special stock once a day.
● Stealing from a shop which is partly on fire and partly dissolving in acid seems risky but you decide to give it a go. Make a Sleight of Hand test opposed by the alchemist’s Awareness skill of 7. If you succeed you gain herbs worth 2d6 gp. If you fail, he spots you and gives you one chance to leave before he starts throwing acid - an offer you accept. You cannot return here for a week.

M24 Place of Execution Suggested Maximum number: 2
A fearsome sight greets your eyes. At the centre of a small drab square there is a raised wooden platform upon which there are gallows and a large wooden block, the top and sides of which are darkly stained.
A chill runs through you as you realise that this must be the place where public executions happen. The square is quiet at the moment apart from the usual to and fro of everyday business, but before you carry on you take a moment to pray that you never end up as the entertainment here.
Special: Roll 2d6. On the result of a 2 or 3, you have arrived just as an execution is taking place. Instead of a quiet square, it is filled to the brim with jeering townsfolk as the condemned is being led up to the block for beheading. There is little you can do about it - the large crowd is clearly excited by the spectacle and there are a number of Watchmen present keeping order. Your choice is straightforward - you can turn away and carry on with your travels or stay and watch the axe fall. Either way, deduct one point of
LUCK for witnessing this grim spectacle.
M25 Ta=oo Parlour Suggested Maximum number: 2
A brightly coloured awning has been a8ached to the front of a house under which sits a woman wearing a long brown sleeveless dress covered by a black leather apron. She sits on a stool; to one side of her is a table with a large collection of vials and stoppered bo8les and on the other side is a large reclining chair.
Behind, on the front wall of the house, is a selection of wooden panels that have been painted in gaudy designs - snakes wrapped around skulls, dancing ladies and so on. In her hand she holds a shiny metal needle. As you pass by she gestures to you, inviting you to become her next customer. What do you do?
● Nod back and hurry on, you’ve no desire to get inked today.
● Go over and select a design for a tattoo - it costs 2gp for a small tattoo, which is permanent, of a design of your choosing. Make a note on your character sheet as to the nature and location of your tattoo. It takes one hour to complete the work.
● Inquire about any special services - if you have the
AFF Characteres Companion, you can ask for Magical
Tattooing. Use the rules described there.
●  A8empt to steal a bo8le of ink - make a sleight of hand skill roll. If you succeed you have acquired a vial of coloured ink (worth 4gp). If you fail, you have been spotted and should leave to a new location before the Watch can be called! You cannot return to this shop for a week.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 153 M26 Workshop
Suggested Maximum number: 3 per location
A huge number of trades are carried out within the city, though most of them are of no interest to a Character.
Still, it may be that you come across such places as you explore the city and you may want to make a note of where they are and the trade they are carrying out.
Small workshops are very numerous - often a workshop is the lower floor of a house or a side building, with goods being either sold directly onto the street or sent to the marketplace and you can come across a place of trade like this in almost every part of the city, thus the maximum number is given per location rather than for the settlement as a whole.
Roll twice to see what kind of trade is carried out -
roll once for the category and again to see what activity is going on.

1-2 Food
3-4 Craft
5-6 Everyday
1 Butcher Tinker Weaver 2 Baker Carpenter Cobbler 3 Pres. foods Stonemason Po8er 4 Brewer Jeweller Laundry 5 Spice Trader Carpenter Leatherworker 6 Wine Trader Classroom Herbalist
The workshops may sell directly to customers or not:
If you wish to trade with them, make a test against your Bargain skill. If you succeed they are willing to sell you appropriate goods (use the prices as listed in the main AFF rulebook) but they won’t buy goods from you.
All of the items sold by these workshops can usually be found in the marketplace.
M27 Bathhouse Suggested Maximum number: 3
A soft tinkling of water draws your gaze towards a well made building, the lower floor of which is fronted with carved stone reliefs showing scenes of water nymphs, fountains and pools of gently rippling water. To either side of the door are carved sea serpents from the mouths of which pour steady streams of water, falling into bowls held in their tails.
There are no windows on the street front, but there are some grills carved into the stone from which wisps of steam are escaping. The door is open and inside you see a towel carrying attendant, waiting to take your money. The bathhouse offers you a chance to relax and clean up after your hard day of adventuring!
Here you can obtain the following services: Laundry
- your clothes taken and cleaned, 1gp, takes two
hours. A dip in the communal bath - warm water
(either from hot springs or heated by wood stoves) will ease your muscles, restoring one point of
STAMINA - 2gp. A private room with its own bath
(fresh water) and a massage - also restores one point of STAMINA and costs 5gp.
M28 Stables Suggested Maximum number: 5
The smell of manure and whinnying of horses tells you that there is a stableyard nearby. Looking around you can see an open set of gates through which you spy a number of stable lads attending to horses whilst a farrier works on re-shoeing one of them. This seems to be a well organised and respectable stable, which you could make use of. A young woman  notices your interest and comes over to greet you, asking what manner of help you are after.
You can stable a horse here (1gp/day) or purchase any items related to owning or caring for your steeds, including purchasing a horse. See the AFF Rulebook for prices.

M29 Auction House Suggested Maximum number: 2
The sound of an auctioneer in full flow, chanting out the bids, alerts you to the existence of an auction house nearby.
It is an extravagant building, just an open space with a canvas roof held up by wooden poles under which an auctioneer stands on a raised platform, calling out the bids on a variety of items. To one side of him is the stock, available for inspection. It is a mix of everyday items and animals, seemingly assembled at random.
The auction appears to be public and you can attend if you want, either to buy or sell - they will auction anything up to the value of 50gp on your behalf and you can buy anything listed under ‘Clothing’,
‘Transport’, ‘Livestock’ or ‘General Equipment’ plus one Sorcery spell component.
In order to take part, make five tests of your Bargain or Evaluate skill and record how many successes you get. 1-2 Successes - items cost double, or sell for half value. 3 Successes: You buy and sell at listed prices.
4-5 Successes - items cost one quarter less than usual
and you sell for a quarter more than the listed price.
The auction is not available everyday. If you come back to this location, roll 1d6 - the auction is in progress if you roll a 5 or 6 (only roll once per day).
M30 Shady Dealer Suggested Maximum number: 2
You have stopped for a moment to consider your next move. Whilst catching your breath and looking around you notice someone coming out of a nearby building in a furtive and suspicious manner, piquing your interest. Next to a painted but dirty and damaged wooden door you can see there is a shuttered window. The shutters are closed but they are not of great quality and you can just about make out a lamplit parlour inside, which seems to be some kind of shop. As you watch a person approaches the door and knocks in a highly unusual fashion. After a moment you hear bolts clicking back and the door is briefly opened and shut and bolted again once this new customer has entered.
If you wish to, you can approach and try to gain entrance. You must test against your Secret Signs skill to mimic the knock you heard. If you fail the test, you see someone come close to the damaged shu8er before a curtain is pulled over the window, concealing everything inside, and the door remains locked to you. You can try again the next day.
If you succeed in the Secret Signs skill test the door is opened and an older man with a long dark beard ushers you into his emporium. Judging by the manner of strange and expensive items, this is some sort of dealer in unusual items.
Here you can buy items from the Sorcery Spell
Components and Magical Sundries sections of the
Advanced Fighting Fantasy price list, but at twice the normal listed price. On any day that you visit, 1d6 items are available.
The Shady Dealer is not always open - if you return, roll 1d6. They are open for business on a 1 or 2.

## Settlement Details Sheet

As you create and map out your settlements, you should keep a track of what they contain and other useful details such as the name, origin etc. This does not have to be done for every place that you come across, but it is worth keeping a track of the basics
(name, reason for existence, dominant type of people) to help you build up a map of the world.
These sheets are an example of how you might do that. We have taken the city of Ludria, which is not intended to be a specific place within Titan (though you can use it as such) but simply an example of how you can build up and describe a settlement.

Looking at the results and the location we decide that
Ludria is a busy port city that is most concerned with trade and commerce. To round it out a bit further we give Ludria a pair of rulers - Lord Venip and Lady
Griselda Bloth who are interested mostly in money and gossip, leaving the city to run itself with the minimum of oversight. This is a busy and dangerous place with lots going on and not much law enforcement or religious fervour to stop any criminals who want to operate here.
Individual Locations
As you explore your settlement you can give names and further descriptions to the locations you find. As you discover more details about each location, by having ‘Map Encounters’ you can add them in and build up a fuller picture of what this settlement contains. We have included a few example map encounters for each location, you should feel free to replace them or add more if you want to use this city as part of your game. In addition we have numbered each location so you can find one randomly by rolling 1d6,1d6 to get a set of ‘coordinates’ (e.g. 4,4 is ST3 - Streets 3, ‘The Hill’).
You don’t need to do this for every settlement you encounter in your travels, but if you intend to return to one on a regular basis it is worth keeping a note of what you have found as this will save you having to rebuild your map and provide you with ideas for encounters and missions.

This foul smelling drinking pit is noted for having a large specimen jar containing the remains of an animal floating in cloudy liquid all suspended in chains by the door.
Hard up against the city wall, ‘The Hole’ is a favoured spot for the Watch to drink, making it slightly less dangerous than other cheap bars.
Run by and favoured by dwarves this stone built tavern has as its sign a large, horridly ugly, troll's head hanging above the door. The nearby city gate is used by the guards and is not open to the public (or Characteres).
Overlooking the sea this nautically themed tavern has a number of Sharks jaws decorating the walls.
Run by Agatha Skovland (Big Squeeze) a woman from the north lands, known for her hearty meals and strong ale.
A decent enough watering hole, kept clean & tidy by the Bramby family.
A place of many workshops connected to the market place, known for its tendency to burn down with surprising regularity.
This area of low ground is prone to flooding by the river and some of the shacks are on stilts. It is a haven for smugglers.
Once an a8ractive part of the city with a busy dockside, a great wave levelled many of the houses and reduced the docks to rubble. It has never really recovered.
Said to be the oldest part of Ludria this quieter part of the city borders both the river and the park.

A ridge of land that is home to some of the wealthiest nobles and merchants that make their home in Ludria including the home of Venip Bloth, Lord of Ludria.
Between the docks and the grand market, the silver streets are the home of many merchants and artisans that have made their fortunes in Ludria.
A large stone and wood building, painted gaudy red, dominates this area. This theatre serves up entertainment for the upper classes and wealthy merchants.
A wide street holds several places to eat, drink and be entertained, particularly ‘The Jangles’ which is a raucous street of entertainment halls showing a variety of acts - singers, dancers, acrobats, comedians and so on.
Dedicated to Solinthar, Hydana, Sukh and
Pangara this temple is visited frequently by mariners and merchants, hoping for a safe passage across the waters.
Dedicated to Aqualis (on account of the wealth that comes down the river) and Libra
(maintaining order) this well maintained temple next to the keep is where important services relating to the nobility are held.

A series of temples dedicated to many gods but mostly Galana, Glantanka and Fulkra this district is where many farmers and travellers come to make their observances.
A large open square ringed with shops, the main marketplace of Ludria is busy almost everyday with stalls, hawkers and shops selling all manner of goods.
A maze of narrow streets lined with shops and stalls, popular as a place to wander and browse the goods on offer.
As a port city the docks are the most important district in Ludria and as such they have their own palisade wall and watch-house. Sailors, workers and goods move in and out continuously. As well as the ships and boats a ferry service crosses from here to ‘The Hill’ for a 1gp fee.
The highest point in Ludria perched on a spur of hard rock the Ludria Keep is home to Lord Bloth and his family and retainers. Rumour has it that beneath the keep lies a terrible dungeon full of traps and monsters. Soldiers and Watchmen patrol here endlessly.
A brief cart ride from the Keep lies the Jail, located on Gibbet Street. Woe betide anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves locked in its rat infested cells.
Used for a variety of purposes such as sporting contests or circuses, the citizens of Ludria like to come here to relax and socialise. A large entrance gate opens onto ‘The Fayre’.
Once a slum, this area was condemned after an outbreak of plague and has descended even further into ruin; it is now used as a place where all manner of filth is disposed of.
