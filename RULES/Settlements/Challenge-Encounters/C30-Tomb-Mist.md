C30 Tomb Mist
At first you ignore the fine mist that seems to be creeping up from the ground but as it thickens you start to worry. With alarming speed your vision is obscured by a freezing fog that leaves you fumbling in a whiteout with the temperature plummeting - you start to shiver. Clearly, this is no ordinary mist, but something malicious and predatory.
You must test your Awareness skill to escape from the Tomb Mist. Each round that you spend inside the mist, you lose 2 points of STAMINA as the cold leeches away your life. You must succeed three times with your Awareness skill (make one test each round) to find a way out. You may also test your LUCK to escape - if successful you stumble out of the mists in the same round, disorientated but alive.
There is no way for you to fight the Tomb Mist and even as you leave you see that the tendrils of vapour are starting to sink back into the ground, perhaps awaiting another victim.
Special: If your settlement is in a particularly hot climate, the Tomb Mist is a swirling cloud of ash that burns you for 2 points of STAMINA damage until you escape it.
