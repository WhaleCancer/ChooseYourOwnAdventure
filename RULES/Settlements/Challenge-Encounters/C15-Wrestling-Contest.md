C15 Wrestling Contest
A large group of peasants and townsfolk has gathered in a doughnut shaped crowd around something that is causing them to cheer and shout in excitement. Getting closer you can see that in the middle a wrestling match is taking place, with the two competitors rolling about in dirt grunting and heaving as they try to gain an advantage.
There seems to be a referee in charge of it and around the edge of the ring - which has no rope to mark it - you can see frantic betting activity taking place. You note that there are a couple of Watchmen in the crowd, enjoying the spectacle, so you think it's probably not against the local laws.
As the contest comes to an end with one man slapping the ground in submission, the referee goes around settling the bets and calling out to the crowd asking for challengers. It looks like you could step up if you want to fight?
If you choose to fight, a greasy man explains the rules: you will need to be unarmoured and leave your weapons to one side. No magic of any kind is tolerated. You fight five 'rounds' that last one minute each, though only one SKILL roll is made for each round.
Use Brawling skill if you have it. Both fighters are unarmoured and use the Unarmed damage table.
Record STAMINA damage separately to normal damage, it is temporary fatigue and can be recovered by resting for a few minutes between bouts. If you are reduced to zero STAMINA you have been choked
(knocked) out and lose, you will recover a few minutes later with a sore head as your only reward.
First Challenge: 'Dirty' Hans. SKILL 6 STAMINA 7.
At the start each 'round' roll a 1d6 - on a 1 or 2 'Dirty'
Hans has grabbed you in a delicate spot (a big 'oooh' from the crowd) and the pain causes you a -2 penalty to your SKILL for that round. If you win, you get a purse of 5gp as reward and can move onto the next fight.
Second Challenge: 'Knuckles' O'Reilly. SKILL 6
STAMINA 8. 'Knuckles' likes to go for the uppercut.
If you lose a round to him, it means he has caught you square on the chin with a hard right hand and take an extra point of damage to your STAMINA in addition to the amount rolled. If you defeat 'Knuckles' you receive a purse of 10gp and can challenge Borkin.
Final Challenge: 'Brickhead' Borkin. SKILL 7
STAMINA 9. As well as being natural sprinters, the low centre of gravity and general toughness of
Dwarves makes them excellent grapplers.
Each 'round' you fight Borkin, roll 1d6. On a 1,2 or 3
Borkin has headbutted you in the guts causing one point of STAMINA damage and -1 to SKILL due to nausea. The nausea penalty lasts for the whole contest and adds up! If you defeat this champion, you get a purse of 15gp, a massive cheer from the crowd and +1 to your next two Leadership rolls in this settlement.
You can of course simply watch the contest and take no part. In which case, move on to your next encounter.
