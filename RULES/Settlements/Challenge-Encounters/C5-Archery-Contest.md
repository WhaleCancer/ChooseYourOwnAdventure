C5 Archery Contest
An archery contest is being held! A local lord wants to call on the support of his archers and to make sure that the peasants are training as the law requires.
All may enter for a fee of 3gp and try to win a prize.
Each archer is given 10 shots to prove their worth.
For each shot, make a combat roll (2d6 + your skill) and compare it to the following target numbers to see where you hit:
● Bullseye (12 points) - 22
● Yellow Rings (8 points) - 18
● Red Rings (6 points)  - 15
● Blue Rings (3 points) - 13.
Tally up the points you score with 10 shots
(ammunition is provided). The prizes awarded are:
● 100 points or over - tournament winner, 100gp and
+1 on Etiquette and Leadership skill roles in this settlement due to your fame for a week.
● 80-99 points - a 25gp purse and much admiration from the crowd.
● 50-79 points - a 5gp purse and thanks for participating.
● Below 49 points - the mockery of your fellow competitors. Take a -2 penalty the next time you use a bow, due to your shaky confidence.
Participating in the competition can be assumed to take up most of the day.
