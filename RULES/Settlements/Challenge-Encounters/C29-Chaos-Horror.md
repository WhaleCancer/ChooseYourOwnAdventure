Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
A chill runs down your spine and a feeling of dread settles on your mind - looking around you can see nothing at first, but you have blundered into a bubble of raw chaotic magic. It seems as if something is watching you intently then, very suddenly, a creature forms out of the air in front of you as if stepping through from some other plane of reality. You get a glimpse of sharp claws and teeth and eyes burning red with rage before it attacks! The chaos horror is an amalgamation of different beasts, dredged from your subconscious - the head of a bear, the talons of an eagle and the body of a huge spider for example. All that really matters is that it is full of fury. The beast draws its strength from you, so the difficulty of the fight will depend on how powerful a Character you are.

Once defeated, the Chaos Horror will disappear, twisting back through a hole in reality to whence it came with a wailing shriek of frustration.
