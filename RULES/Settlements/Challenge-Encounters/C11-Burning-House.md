C11 Burning House
Passing by a group of wooden dwellings, you hear a commotion and shouting voices. A moment later the smell of smoke hits you - one of the houses has caught fire! A woman stands outside trying to beat at the flames with a broom and a child is dashing off in search of water. A few people have stopped to look and are wondering what to do.  What do you do?
● Walk on by. This isn't a problem you are interested in. Move on to your next encounter.
● Try and rouse other people to help fight the fire.
Make a Leadership skill roll, if successful you round up a chain-gang to bring water and put out the fire.
You are rewarded with a hearty meal (eat it now or add one to your provisions).
● Dive in and attack the fire yourself; every round you must roll against Dodge skill or take one point of damage. If you survive 6 rounds of firefighting you have put it out almost single handedly. As a reward the householder gives you a family heirloom; a silver pendant cast in the shape of a fox with a piece of amber for an eye. It is a pretty piece of jewellery, worth 5gp if you want to sell it.
