Acid Touch
Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Special: If this attack hits, it sprays acid on to you, causing 3 points of damage. Armour protects from this but at a cost - for each point of damage your armour absorbs, you will need to spend one gold piece repairing it or suffer a -1 penalty to your armour rolls until you do so.
The touch of chaos is upon the land, even in civilised places, twisting life into new and strange forms. Here it has found a host in a colony of slime moulds and grown into a hungry, dangerous beast.
The Ravenous Slime at first appears to be a large pile of trash - pieces of wood, leaves, scraps of clothing, the bones of some unfortunate animal and so on but as you approach it lurches up and slithers rapidly towards you, sending out long tentacle feelers that are dripping with acid - it means to devour you! You must fight it or end up as its next meal.
