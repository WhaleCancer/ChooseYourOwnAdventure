Attacking these creatures is not an Unlawful Action.
These crab-like creatures, covered in hard plates of bone, infest the catacombs beneath the city.
Occasionally they will venture out onto the surface in the hunt for a tasty meal. The usual way of discovering their presence is the remains of the domestic animals they have eaten or finding holes chewed through the walls near any food store. They may be small (about coconut sized) but they are extremely vicious and good at ambushing. Their first attack will always cause 1 point of stamina damage as they scurry in for a bite.
