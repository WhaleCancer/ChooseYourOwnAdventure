Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action.
Oh dear. A pair of Cutthroats have found you, with the sure and malicious belief that they can separate you from your fortune.
Make a test of Awareness skill. If you pass, you realise that they are upon you a moment before they strike and you can fight the combat as normal. If you fail the test, they have managed to sneak up on you and gain a bonus of +2 to their SKILL in the first round of combat, as they seek to finish you off as quickly as possible.
You must fight both of them at once. If you defeat one, you may make a test against your Con skill - if you succeed the other cutthroat flees. If you fail the test he will stay and try to avenge his fallen accomplice.
If you don't wish to fight, you can try (after the first round) to pay them off. Make a Bargain skill roll, with a bonus of one for every extra gold piece you are willing to offer - if you succeed you pay them 2d6 gold pieces (plus whatever you offered as a bribe) and they decide to take their ill gotten gains and slink back into the shadows.
