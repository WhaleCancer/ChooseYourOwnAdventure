Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Unbeknownst to you a sneaky goblin infiltrator has been lurking here, waiting for a victim. As you approach it leaps from its cover to attack you! You must make an Awareness Skill roll, to see if you are surprised on the first round of combat. After that, it is a straight fight to the death - if you survive, you may move on to your next encounter.
