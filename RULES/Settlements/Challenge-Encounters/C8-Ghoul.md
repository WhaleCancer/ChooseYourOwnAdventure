Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Special:
If the Ghoul hits you four times, you
will become paralysed and unable to
defend yourself!
You notice a lurching figure dressed in tattered rags.
Initially, you think it to be some poor leper or other unfortunate that you may be able to help in some way, until it turns toward you showing a face of rotting flesh and exposed bone! Gasping in horror you realise this must be a ghoul, escaped from its crypt and hungry for flesh! At this moment it is leering at a screaming peasant and looks set to devour the poor defenceless wretch. What do you do?
● A terrible thing, to be sure, but not actually your problem - you can try and slip away unnoticed. Make a Sneaking Skill roll. If you succeed you can get away in the commotion. If you fail, you still escape the ghoul but your cowardice has been noticed (and will be widely reported!) and you suffer a -2 penalty to your next Leadership skill roll in this settlement.
● You are a Character and it is time to do your thing. You step forward, putting yourself between the ghoul and its intended victim. If you succeed in vanquishing it, your bravery will be spoken of in the inns and taverns of this place. Gain a +2 bonus to your next Leadership skill roll in this settlement.
