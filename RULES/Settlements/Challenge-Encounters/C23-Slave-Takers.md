Attacking these people is not an Unlawful Action.
Lurching from their hiding spot in a nearby alleyway are two rough men dressed in shabby clothing with a collection of interesting tattoos and scars on their faces. They are clearly coming towards you and you notice with alarm that one of them is carrying a net and manacles!
Although slavery is generally illegal, the laws are rarely enforced and men such as these are employed to drag the unfortunate away to a life of servitude in some form of hard labour. Most end up deep in a mine or shackled to the oars of a pirate ship. Your only way to avoid this is to fight.
Special: The first time one of the Slave Takers hits you, they will do no damage but instead wrap you in a weighted net. This causes you a penalty of -2 to your
SKILL until you spend a whole round untangling yourself.
