C4 Funeral Cortege
Carrying a coffin draped in dark cloth, a group of mourners are making their way down the street. They are dressed mostly in black with hoods obscuring their faces.
Four men carry the casket, trudging their footsteps through the filthy mud of this alleyway. At the head of the procession a tall woman carries a large gong with which she is beating out the slow rhythm of their march and next to her a short but very rotund man is waving an incense burner and chanting a dirge.
They take up most of the narrow street. You stop, thinking to pay your respects as they pass. What do you do?
● Bow your head and offer up a prayer as they pass.
Make a LUCK roll. If you fail the procession stops as it reaches you and the coffin is opened, revealing it to be empty -  these are not mourners, they are actually cultists looking for a victim to fill it! Fight them to survive. If you pass the LUCK test, the cortege slowly moves by.
● Something about this bothers you. Make an
Awareness SKILL roll - if successful you spot the bulges of concealed weapons under their robes and recognise the chants as those of a foul death cult...you have just enough time to slip away down a side alley before these cultists reach you. If you fail the roll, make a LUCK roll as above to see if they wish to grab you!
● You've no time for this sentimentality. You barge forward, secretly hoping that they drop the coffin as you jostle them. Moments later you realise your mistake as the Cultists attack you - they want you in that coffin! Make a test of your Strength skill - if you succeed, you have scared the cultists with your belligerence and fight with a +2 bonus.

Attacking these people is not an Unlawful Action.
There are 6 cultists that must be fought off, they will fight to the last. You must fight them three at a time.
They wield clubs as weapons (concealed in their loose robes) and they have no armour.
If you wish to avoid fighting them, you can attempt to make a Con roll with a -3 penalty to convince them that you are another member of the same cult, just checking up on them. If the attempt fails, it's time to fight.
If you survive this fight you may loot a pack of incense, an incense burner and a bronze gong should you wish to take them. They can be sold for 20gp or kept (they take up one encumbrance slot).
