Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Cries of 'help!' and 'save us!' alert you to a nearby commotion. It appears a fire sprite has travelled from the elemental plane of fire to burn whatever it can find, which at the moment includes people's hats, hair and houses.
The sprite is leaping nimbly from rooftop to rooftop and raining down small firebolts on the peasants and their dwellings. People are caught between diving into cover to avoid getting scorched, or getting buckets and water to put out the fires that are starting to take hold on the roofs and timbers. This could become a very dangerous situation! What do you do?
● Decide it's probably someone else's problem and move on to another location. The peasants are not impressed, jeering at your cowardice. Your next
Leadership skill roll has a -1 penalty.
● Rush to help - the sprite is hard to reach without a ranged weapon or spell, and you must pass a test against your Jump skill to reach it. If you fail the test you have a -2 penalty to your combat SKILL roll as it dances away from your reach. The sprite is angered by your interference and will launch a fiery bolt at you every time you succeed in hitting it. Should you defeat the sprite the grateful people give you 1d6gp as a reward.
