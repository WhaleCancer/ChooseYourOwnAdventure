Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Perhaps it was a maggot laid on the body of a chaos warped beast, or maybe it drank a sip from the spilled liquids of a potion maker's workbench, for whatever reason a fly has grown to horrific size. As big as a crow and dripping diseased fluids from its finger like proboscis, this foul creature buzzes through the city looking for warm blood to slurp on. The Monstrous
Fly is not dangerous in combat - it is too large and clumsy to dart out of the way like its tiny brethren - but instead relies on stealth and surprise.
To avoid the attack you must make a test against your
Awareness skill. If you succeed you can fight the fly as a normal combatant to avoid its bite. If you fail the test (or if the fly beats you in combat) it swoops in and latches onto you for a moment, sucking on your blood. This causes one point of STAMINA damage and injects you with its filth. You must test against your LUCK or contract shivering disease: within minutes you feel chilled to your bones and start shivering as if you were naked on a mountaintop.
Your maximum STAMINA is reduced by one and your Combat and Movement skills suffer a -1 penalty.
The disease lasts for 1d6 days and each day your maximum STAMINA falls by one and you suffer a further -1 penalty to your Combat and Movement skills. If you survive, your health returns after a full night's rest and all penalties are removed. You may want to go and see a healer…
After one bite the fly will buzz off to seek a new victim, though you can try to swipe at it as it leaves for the sake of stopping its horrible work - you'll be doing everyone a favour.
