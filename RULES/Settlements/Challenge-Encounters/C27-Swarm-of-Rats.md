C27 Swarm of Rats
What begins as a pleasant noise, like the rustling of leaves in a breeze, rapidly turns to horror as you hear the squeaking and scratching of thousands of tiny claws - a swarm of rats has been driven out of their nest and are surging towards you, their eyes gleaming with maddened hunger. You need to do something or risk being overrun!
● Try to get out of their way: You may make a test against either your Climb or Acrobatics skills to make a leap to safety and cling on to some nearby surface whilst the swarm passes.
● Do you have a torch to hand or some means of making fire? If so you can try to ward off the swarm by using their fear of fire to keep them at bay. If you choose this option, test against your Animal Lore skill to see if you can pull it off. If you succeed the swarm goes around your barrier.
● Fight them! You can't hope to kill them all as they pass, but maybe you can defend yourself. Make a test against your weapon skill but with a -3 penalty due to the number of opponents. If you succeed you have managed to keep them at bay as they pass.
● Stand very still and hope for the best: You may test your LUCK to see if the rats simply decide you are not worth it (maybe your feet don't smell too tasty?).
If you succeed you close your eyes and pray and when you open them again the swarm has passed.
If you fail to avoid the swarm by some means you are bitten, chewed and gnawed on - take 1d3+1 points of
STAMINA damage and roll on the diseases table (Table 4.3.2 Diseases).
