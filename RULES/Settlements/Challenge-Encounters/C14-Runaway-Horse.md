Attacking this creature is an Unlawful Action.
A cry of 'Gangway! Gangwaaaay!' startles you into turning around just in time to see a young man lose control of his horse which throws its rider and bolts, straight towards you! If you don't take action it will surely crash into you at high speed.
● Try to get out of the way - you can use your Dodge,
Jump or Acrobatics skill to hurl yourself to one side before you are trampled. If you fail the test, you are struck by the horse and bowled along the cobbles, suffering 1d6 points of STAMINA damage.
● Try to grab the reins! You can use either Animal
Lore or Ride skill as you attempt to control the beast.
If you succeed, you manage to grab hold of it and rein it in. Gain +1 to your next Leadership skill roll as the locals applaud your bravery. If you fail, the horse is not impressed and knocks you flying - suffer 1d6 points of STAMINA damage.
