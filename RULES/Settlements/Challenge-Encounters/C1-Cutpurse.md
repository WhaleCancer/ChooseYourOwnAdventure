Attacking this person is not an Unlawful Action.
Make a test against your Awareness Skill with
-3 penalty. If you fail, a skilled cutpurse has relieved
you of 2d6 gold pieces. Deduct them from your total and with a heavy sigh, move on with your adventure.
If you succeed, you have noticed the attempt and must decide what to do.
● Slap her hand away and tell her to stop bothering you. The next time you encounter a cutpurse you may ignore it, as she recognises you. Move on to your next encounter.
● You notice the hand working a blade towards your coin pouch, and with a swift movement you attempt to grab and twist the wrist. Make a SKILL test. If you succeed, you have caught this thief and can hold onto her for long enough to attract the notice of a
Watchman. Hand her over to receive a bounty of 1d6 gold pieces. If you don't like doing the dirty work for the Watch, you may fight her. This is not an Unlawful Action.
● You spin about and growl in the face of this thief.
Make a Leadership Skill test. If you succeed she cowers before you and you may question her about this location. Add +2 to your next City Lore or
Secret Signs test. If you fail, she is startled but not intimidated and will flee.
