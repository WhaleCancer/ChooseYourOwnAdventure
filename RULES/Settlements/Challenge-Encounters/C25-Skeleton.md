Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
With a clickety-clack of rattling bone, a skeleton lurches towards you swinging its sword, a cold blue light of necromantic magic glowing in its empty eye sockets! You have no time to wonder if it lurched out of a nearby crypt or was summoned here to attack you, you must defend yourself!
Note that the bony nature of this monster means edged and pointed weapons such as swords and spears do one point less of damage per hit.
