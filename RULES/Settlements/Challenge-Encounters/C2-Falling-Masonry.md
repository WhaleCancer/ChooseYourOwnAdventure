C2 Falling Masonry
You are walking along minding your own business and trying to work out where to go next when you hear a creak and a snap from above you - a part of the building you are passing has broken off and bricks and tiles are plummeting toward you!
Make a LUCK test (or test your skill to Dodge). If you succeed you manage to dive out of the way. You may continue on your way.
If you fail, you are caught by the falling debris and suffer 1d3 points of damage. Cursing your ill fortune, there is nothing to do but dust yourself down and continue your travels.
