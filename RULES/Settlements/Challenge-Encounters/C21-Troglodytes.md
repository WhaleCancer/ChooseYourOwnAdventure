Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
These little demon worshipping terrors are found throughout Titan, hiding in any dark place such as an abandoned cellar or the sewers of a city. They are usually found in large groups but in this case you have stumbled on a pair that are out foraging or scouting away from their tribe. They are vicious but fearful. In the first round they will shoot with their bows - they are very skilled and gain a +2 on their combat rolls with a bow - but in the next round they will try to flee. If you wish to, you can pursue and fight them or if you would rather not, you can let them scuttle off back to the holes they crept out of.
