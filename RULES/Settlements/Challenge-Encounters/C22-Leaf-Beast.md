Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
It is perhaps embarrassing and certainly un-Characteric to find oneself in combat with a bush, but it appears that you will have to fight this shrubbery or perish!
You had mistaken it for a normal, if very healthy looking piece of hedgerow before you came too close and were startled to find it taking on the form of two leafy bears and lunging their twigs and branches toward you! In fact, you must make an Awareness skill test - if you fail, you are so surprised that they automatically hit you on the first round of combat.
After that you can choose to stay and slay the arboreal terror - you'll be doing everyone a favour - or simply take a few steps back out of its range. If you back off, it grasps for you a few times before transforming back into an ordinary looking plant. It's strange nature means that it takes no damage from arrows or bolts and reduces damage from stabbing weapons, like spears, by one point per hit.
If you do fight and defeat the
Leaf Beast you can take a cutting from its stem which, due to its magical nature, is worth 5gp.
