C3 Falling Nightsoil
Passing along a narrow street lost in your own thoughts you hear a shout of 'mind out below!' as the contents of someone's bedpan are tossed out of a window above you! You have only a moment to dive out of the way and avoid the stinking slurry.
Make a LUCK test (or you may test against your
SKILL, using the Dodge Skill if you have it). If you succeed you manage to sidestep the splatter and after aiming a few curses upwards, you may continue with your adventure.   If you fail you are drenched in waste. For a moment you stand stock still, contemplating the disaster. What do you do?
● Accept your fate and march on. Due to the stench you will be at -3 to all Social Skill tests until you have a chance to clean yourself (at an inn or river).
● Vengeance! Drawing your weapon you smash through the door of the offending house and rush upstairs, where you apply a hefty beating to the poor fellow that drenched you. He begs your forgiveness and helps clean off the muck, but your violence has been noticed by the locals who have called the Watch, and you must roll on the Lawbreaker table, with a minimum result of 6.
