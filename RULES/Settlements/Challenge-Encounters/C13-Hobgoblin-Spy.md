Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
You were taking a moment to yourself whilst standing in a shady corner, looking around at the bustle and hurry of the streets when you notice another figure also standing in the shadows, observing the crowd. Curious about this you move a little closer to get a better look.
As you close in, your curiosity increases - they appear to be armed and something about their posture disturbs you. As you mull this over and their cowled head whips around, revealing the twisted features of a hobgoblin! It must be here spying out a place to raid! With a rasping hiss the hobgoblin leaps to attack you, as the nearby townsfolk scatter in fright.
Special: The Hobgoblin Spy wants to escape rather than fight to the death. If it is reduced below 5
STAMINA it will attempt to flee. It is fleet of foot and agile, so it will clamber over the rooftops and walls to get away.
If you wish to pursue it, you must make a Climbing skill roll for each round of pursuit to keep up with the
Hobgoblin. It will however drop its sword when it flees. Should you kill it, you can claim a bounty of 2d6gp the next time you visit the 'Keep' location.
