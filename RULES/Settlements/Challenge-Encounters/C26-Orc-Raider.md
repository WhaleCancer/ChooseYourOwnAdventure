Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Orcs infest the dark corners of every kingdom and nowhere is entirely safe from their attacks. It is a custom amongst many orc tribes to send a young warrior out to sneak into enemy (usually human) territory to cause chaos of one kind or another - stealing, fighting and slave-taking are the common reasons. The orcs move by night and rely on stealth and intimidation to avoid detection. This one has decided - perhaps unwisely - that you would be a good victim. Pulling back its hood and letting out a snarl of hatred, the orc gives you no option but to fight!
