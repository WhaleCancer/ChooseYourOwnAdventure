Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Any settlement will attract rats and mice and any large settlement will also gather some of their larger more aggressive kin - the Giant Rat. Unfortunately for you, you have disturbed one which is now leaping out from its hiding place to attack! With its vicious teeth and claws this pestilent creature needs dispatching as soon as possible. Your options are simple - kill it or flee.
Note, that should you be bitten by this mucky creature (you take damage from an attack) you may become infected with a disease. Test your LUCK. If you fail, roll on the diseases table (Table 4.3.2
Diseases) to see what afflicts you.
If you succeed in killing it and you happen to be a dwarf, you may make a SKILL (Crafting) test to turn the Giant Rat into a dwarven delicacy, rat skewers. If you succeed you may gain one rations. For a non-
Dwarf, the SKILL test has a -4 penalty. (Just don't think too carefully about what it was eating before you caught up with it).
