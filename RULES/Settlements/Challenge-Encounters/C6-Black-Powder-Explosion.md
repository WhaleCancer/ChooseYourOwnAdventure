C6 Black Powder explosion.
Ahead of you, you see a dwarven sapper is pulling a cart of barrels across an intersection. He loses his footing on some stones wetted by last night's rain, slips and pulls the cart over. Before you can react, one of the barrels bounces free of the cart, spins across the slick cobbles before popping open and spilling its contents of black powder straight onto a small stove a footman is using to brew up his drink! There is a bone shuddering explosion! Roll against Dodge to dive out of the way. If successful you hurl yourself through a doorway and onto the floor of a hovel, avoiding damage. If unsuccessful you take 1d6+2 points of damage, plus the heat of the explosion knocks your boots and hat off, and singes away your hair, eyebrows and beard (if any). Deduct one from your next 3 social skill rolls as you get used to it and
-3 to Disguise skill rolls for a week as it grows back.
Either way you are deafened for one day, deduct 2 from your Awareness skill tests until tomorrow.
As you look around the aftermath you see the explosion has scattered the other barrels of powder around, knocked the sapper over, sent the footman flying along the alley and started several small fires.
How do you react?
● The job of the Character is to help others. You start putting out fires and attend to the footman, who is injured. Make a Healing roll. If successful you bring him round. He tells you his name is Rodni of Skoom, halberdier. You may call upon his aid once. He has
SKILL 7 STAMINA 8 and wields a halberd.
● As your head clears you realise what a mess this place is, which is just a distraction from your mission.
Pulling yourself to your feet you move on.
●In the aftermath, you notice that no one is paying attention to the black powder. Although you have heard it is a dangerous secret, you decide to steal a keg. Make a Sleight of Hand roll. If you fail you must roll on the Lawbreaker table. The keg can be sold for 75gp or it contains thirty 'charges' of black powder.
