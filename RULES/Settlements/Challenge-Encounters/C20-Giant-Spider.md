Large Bite
Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Skittering hideously from its hiding place comes a monstrosity straight out of your nightmares - a leathery, eight legged hunting machine with venom dripping from its fangs.
This one must have crept into the city and found a place where it can hide and prey on anyone unfortunate enough to come by its lair. You will be doing everyone a favour if you can dispatch it. In addition to the normal damage from the bite, it will inject you with venom if it hits. Test against your LUCK or become poisoned.
Each dose of poison reduces your SKILL by 1 for one hour. This adds up - if your SKILL is reduced to zero you will be paralysed...and your fate is not a pretty one as the spider devours you.
If you defeat the Giant Spider you can attempt to cut out its venom glands - it is a tricky task that requires you to pass an Animal Lore skill test, but if you succeed you may sell the glands for 10gp or use them to coat your weapons with a poison that does 1 additional point of damage each time you hit for the duration of one combat, or can coat 10 arrows or crossbow bolts for the same effect.
