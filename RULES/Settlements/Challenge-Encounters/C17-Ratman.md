Attacking this creature is not an Unlawful Action.
Many cities are built on the ruins of previous settlements or have forgotten dungeons and cellars where the creatures of chaos creep in and take up residence.
At night, they creep out again to raid and kill. The ratmen infest almost every city to some extent as they are nearly impossible to wipe out. This one has slithered out from some nearby hole and has been lurking in the shadows ready to spring out on its victim - you!
Make an Awareness skill test. If you succeed, you notice it moments before it strikes and fight as normal. If you fail the test it has caught you unaware and gains a +2 bonus on its SKILL combat roll in the first round.
In addition, Ratmen are covered in filth and muck. If you are wounded in this combat, you must test your
LUCK or contract a disease - roll on Table 4.3.2
Diseases to see what nasty surprise awaits you!
