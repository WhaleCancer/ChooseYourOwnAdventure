## Settlement Creation Rules

In this section we focus on how to create and use your settlement map, focusing on building something that is quick to make but adds real depth and detail to your Character’s adventures.
Settlement Descriptions
For this book we have divided settlements into three categories; city, town and village. Cities have the greatest number of locations and resources, a village might be no more than a temple, tavern and a few rough streets. It is generally recommended that when
Characters are carrying out adventures in civilization (as opposed to the wilderness or a dungeon) that they do so in a city, to provide the full range of environments.
City
You’ve seen the smoke of the cookfires on the horizon for some time and now, tired and weary from your journey, you approach a city. The rough trail you have been following gives way first to a rutted farm track surrounded by walled fields and then to a wider paved road leading up to a great arched gate where you can just make out the glint of sunlight on the guardsmen's armour. Around you the wilderness is now broken up by small farms and homesteads.
Coming over a small rise in the road you get a better look at the city. Around its outskirts there are a large number of small houses made from a mixture of stone and wood, mostly hovels with the occasional more impressive house. This slum reaches right up to the first of the city walls. A raised bank with a stone wall on top of it, some of the slum housing is leaning up against it and the few small towers that dot its length. You note that whilst it looks solid enough there are places where it has been broken down and not yet repaired. More impressive is the inner wall.
Fully 80 feet high in places with a series of round towers spaced along it, this fortification has a huge sense of strength and stability as it looms over the scruffy lean-to’s of the slums. Further back you think you can make out the glint of water, so there may be a river or lake on one side of the city, it is hard to be sure. Now you are closer you can see men-at-arms patrolling its battlements.
Although you can’t make out much of the city inside the walls you do see many rooftops and what looks to be a few large churches and perhaps a keep. The smoke of many fires and the dust kicked up by the traffic going to and fro creates a haze which makes it impossible to pick out too many details. In order to find out more, you’ll have to get inside. A steady stream of people, horses and carts is moving through the main gate and it looks like your only way in…
There are countless cities dotted across the world. A few are famous, but most will be unknown to the traveller who must take their chances as they seek the safety of the walls. That is not to say that these settlements are new - many are very ancient and may have been built and rebuilt upon the same spot several times over, but for all that their fame has not spread far beyond the sight of their towers. It is in these cities that the bravest Characters will find a chance at fame and fortune. There is danger and skullduggery, thrills and sensations. Opportunities can arise at any moment for those willing to take their chances, but beware for there are also those who wish to waylay or harm the careless traveller.
Town
As the woods give way to fields and fenced off orchards, you realise that a small settlement must lie ahead of you. Following a cart track to the crest of a hill you can see down the slope the glittering ribbon of a river upon the banks of which are lined up several streets of thatched houses. Resting here for a moment you can see a few larger buildings amongst the dwellings - a temple certainly and what could be an inn or perhaps a manor house. Even from this

Chapter 4 - Settlements 47 distance you can see plenty of activity around the town, with peasants moving about their tasks often accompanied by livestock of one kind or another. A pony-cart laden with some kind of root vegetable is slowly making its way up the hill toward you, led along by a plump woman wearing so many layers of clothing she has become almost round.
The centre of the town seems to be a bridge from which broader roads lead away on either bank, with most of the buildings clustered around this area.
There is no outer wall but towards the outskirts you can see a raised earthwork which, in places, has a dry stone wall along it. However, even a quick inspection makes you think these are just field boundaries rather than a serious attempt at fortification.
A town is a big enough settlement that it will have at least a small variety of buildings and activities. There will be a temple, often built in some prominent place near the centre, a marketplace, at least one inn or tavern and usually a grand house for whoever is in charge. There may not be a lot to excite the adventurer here, but it is usually a good spot to rest, trade and maybe do a little bit of socialising.
Village
The track you are following has gone along a riverbank for a few miles and you have started to notice some smaller tracks joining up. The thick vegetation to either side of the path has obscured your view until now but as it thins out you start to see some buildings up ahead. There are not many and none of them are too grand, but there looks to be a temple of some kind.
Surrounding much of this settlement is a thick, thorny hedge, probably grown to provide some defence against raiders. This village looks like a good place to rest for a while.
All across Titan are dotted tiny settlements consisting of a mere handful of houses and shacks which serve as a meeting place for the nearby farmsteads, travellers, hunters and so on. Over time they may develop to have some extra buildings such as a temple (very common) or an inn. Sometimes they grow up around nothing more than a hill or a bend in a river.
There is precious little for an adventurer to do in such places but they can provide an opportunity to rest and purchase fresh supplies of food and simple trade goods.

Mapping Your City, Town or Village Settlement Origins
The cities, towns and villages of Titan have been built by many types of creatures, but the most usual of these are the humans, dwarves and elves. It is worth remembering that in general settlements have a mixture of origins and in some places the original builders have been replaced wholesale by a different group, probably as a result of conflict. Although it doesn’t have to, knowing who were the original inhabitants of your settlement might influence how you interpret and draw your map.
Choose an origin or make a roll to see what is the dominant architecture for your location.

## Table 4.1.1 Settlement Origins

Roll
Origin 1-3
Human*: This place was founded by humans and nearly all buildings have been built by human hands,

so the architecture depends on the location. Near woodland, the houses will be mostly wood, up in the

mountains, stone and slate are more common for example. It is up to you to decide based on the

surrounding terrain. Human settlements may be walled or fortified, but they also have a tendency to

spread across the surrounding land.
4
Dwarven: This settlement grew up around an ancient dwarven minehead, long abandoned and settled

by the humans of this area. Around the centre, the buildings are made of well cut stone, with thick walls and low doorways. Many of the streets and alleys are covered with arched roofs. Any Dwarf character

can add +1 to their City Lore Skill here. Dwarven settlements often extend below ground and may have several ‘levels’ connected by ramps and shafts.
5
Elven: The heart of this place was once a forest glade or natural wonder, such as a waterfall or gorge, that was home to a community of elves. Although it is now largely occupied by humans you still find elegant buildings decorated with wooden carvings, sometimes incorporating living trees into their design, and

the streets and alleys are lined with trees or flowers. An Elven character can add +1 to their City Lore

Skill here. Elven settlements tend to expand in harmony with the landscape and any natural

features.
6
Chaos/Evil Wrought: This place was once home to the forces of evil, long since vanquished...you hope.
Although great efforts have been made to erase all traces of its terrible past, you still find some of the buildings are ominous with disturbing carvings and decoration and the streets and alleys are often laid out in ways that seem designed to confuse and disorient you. All characters suffer a -1 penalty to their
City Lore Skill here. These settlements may have layouts that are confusing or illogical.
*If you are creating settlements in lands ruled by specific peoples, replace humans with the local dominant race. For example,
if you are mapping out the swamps ruled by the Lizardmen a result of 1-3 on this table means the settlement was made by the Lizardmen. In this situation, replace the Chaos / Evil Wrought result with humans.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 49 Reason for Settlement Placement
People rarely bother creating a city, town or village simply on a whim! There is usually a reason for it existing where it does, though it may have changed or developed dramatically over time. You can invent a reason that makes sense for your campaign or adventure, or you can roll on the following table to provide some inspiration.

## Table 4.1.2 Reason for Settlement Placement

Current Occupation
It is strongly suggested that you choose the current occupation of your starting settlement, or be prepared to come up with an explanation for why you are there. Most commonly, your Character should start at a city that is home to many types of people - mostly humans, but with a fair number of dwarves and elves either visiting or living there.
For other settlements you encounter, you can either choose who lives there based on other factors (if you find a village next to a mighty dwarven city, it is probably dwarves or humans that live there and not orcs) or roll to see.

## Table 4.1.3 Current Occupation

Origin 2d6 Current Population Human* 1-8 Human 9-10
Mixed city of Humans, Dwarves, Elves 11 Dwarves 12 ‘Evil’ humanoids.
Dwarven 1-9 Dwarves
10-11  Mixed city of Humans, Dwarves, Elves
12 ‘Evil’ humanoids.
Elven 1-10 Elves 11
Mixed city of Humans, Dwarves, Elves 12 ‘Evil’ humanoids Chaos / Evil  1-8
‘Evil’ Humanoids, 9-12: Mixed city of Humans, Dwarves, Elves
*If you are creating settlements in lands ruled by specific peoples, replace humans with the local dominant race. For example,
if you are mapping out the swamps ruled by the Lizardmen, replace ‘human’ in this table with ‘Lizardman’. A Mixed City will be a mostly human city with other races instead.
## Generating a map

See [Generating-a-Map.md](Creating-Settlements/Generating-a-Map.md) for detailed instructions on creating settlement maps, including the dice drop method.

Types of Location in a Settlement
Within your settlement, there are a number of locations which can be found. These are not meant to be a comprehensive list of all the buildings that exist here, just some of the important landmarks that you might interact with as an adventurer. So, for example, the ‘Temple’ location will include not just a large and notable temple, but also houses, accommodation for travelling pilgrims, places for them to eat, maybe a small graveyard and so on.
The temple is simply the most important and busy building in this part of the settlement. Not every settlement has all the types of location - you will not usually find a College in a town or village (unless you particularly want one). The table below gives you a guide as to the number and type of location you can find in each settlement. For towns and villages some locations are given as chance on a roll. You may find a College in a town (on a roll of a 1 on a 1d6) but it is unlikely.
