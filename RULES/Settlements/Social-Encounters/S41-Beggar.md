Attacking this person is not an Unlawful Action.
A head covered in filthy matted hair, crawling in lice, holds a face which is pox-scarred and weatherbeaten. Filthy rags cover the man's painfully thin body and limbs as he holds out a wooden bowl towards you. 'Alms for the poor?' he asks in a voice that has been ravaged by too many icy cold winter nights spent sleeping in the rough. Whatever he once was, this beggar is now amongst the lowest of the low. What do you do?
● Holding your cape over your face to avoid infection, you step smartly around him and move on.
● Pity tugs your heartstrings: Reaching into your purse you drop 1 gold piece into his bowl - the beggar is overjoyed and thanks you profusely, to the point of embarrassment as a small crowd has noticed your generosity. Add +1 to your next Leadership roll.
● What is worth more than gold? A bit of kindness, you believe. You stop and talk to the man, offering him what comfort you can before you move on. Roll 1d6 - on a roll of 1 you have caught something from him and must roll on 'Table 4.3.2 Diseases'. On a roll of 6 the gods have noticed your efforts and favoured you; restore one point of LUCK.
● Ask him if he wants a job: Make a Bargain or Con roll with a +2 bonus. If you succeed you Call Upon the Aid of this beggar when in the Slum Street, Graveyard, Garbage Heap, Temple or Jail locations for a fee of 1 gp. He will hurl himself into combat, armed with a club. If you fail the skill test the beggar is afraid of you and shuffles away like a beaten dog.
