Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Coughing and spluttering their last, you have come across a victim of the type of violence that is all too common in the city. It is clear that without assistance this person will soon be going to meet their maker. What do you do?
● You don't know why they've ended up this way and you don't want to find out. Averting your eyes, you move on.
● This poor wretch needs your help, urgently. You can use either the Healing skill or, if you have it, magical healing to aid them. If you use the Healing skill you must pass a skill test to have an effect. If your healing is successful, you staunch their wounds and bring them back to consciousness. You may also move them to a Temple or Hospital location and pay 5gp to the priests to save them if you have no trust in your own healing skills. If you should save them, they are too weak to do much more than thankyou for your help but promise to remember you. If you should die in this settlement, roll 1d6 - on a roll of 1 your new friend happens to be passing by and will return the favour by pulling you to safety! You will wake up at one of the Temple locations, with all your gear and one point of STAMINA. The life-debt is repaid.
● Life has no mercy for the weak. You quickly frisk them for valuables as they clutch at you feebly - roll 1d6: 1-3: Nothing, 4-5: A pouch containing 1d6gp, 6: You are spotted and a hue and cry is raised - you must roll on the table 4.1.30 'Lawbreaker Table'.
