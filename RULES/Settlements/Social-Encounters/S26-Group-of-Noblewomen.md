Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action.
Swishing along in thick skirts of good cloth are three young women, chattering to one another about something that is, judging by their laughter, highly amusing. You are so dazzled to see a small island of colour and mirth that only a last minute side-step stops you from crashing into the middle of the group. The women look up, startled by your sudden presence and their conversation comes to a halt as crashing as the one you just executed. They do not seem impressed - what do you do?
● Offer your profuse apologies and, with a little bow, move on to your next encounter.
● Put on your most charming smile, flourish a little wave of the hand and do your best to strike up a conversation. Make an Etiquette roll. If you succeed in impressing them, you spend a pleasant hour chatting about social matters. Make a roll on Table 8.5 Lust for Power - Rumours & Events.
● Given the dangers facing you and the city, it's an affront to see such carefree people. Growling, you barge through the middle of the group muttering curses. Make a Con skill roll with a +2 bonus - if you succeed one of the women faints and collapses dramatically to the floor! Add +1 to your next Con roll out of satisfaction. Move on to your next encounter. If you fail at the roll they laugh at your surly behaviour and you have a penalty of 1 to your next Con roll as your ego takes a knock.
