A sturdy looking middle aged woman dressed in practical work clothes and a leather apron is seated on a nearby bench whilst using a couple of small tools to work a design onto a wooden block. You watch her for a moment; she is intent on her work, making careful incisions on the piece with a small chisel and hammer, occasionally changing to a different tool which she pulls from the large pockets on her apron. It is clear that she is a skilled crafter and you suspect from the quality of her apparel that she is well paid for her work. What do you do?
● Maybe when you are a famous Character, you will let her make a woodcut of your exploits, but for now you leave her be and move on to your next encounter.
● A craftswoman such as this must know a lot about the city; you try to strike up a conversation with the hope of discovering something useful. Make an Etiquette roll. If you succeed she is happy to chat with you about her work and you gain +1 to your next Bargain and City Lore rolls. If you fail the roll, she is too absorbed in her work to talk.
● You don't have time to be nice. You reach down and snatch the woodwork out of her hands, then demand she helps you on your quest if she wants her piece back. Make a Con roll. If successful, she cowers and agrees to help you - gain +1 on your next City Lore roll. If you fail, she stands up and starts loudly haranguing you for your rudeness, quickly attracting a crowd of onlookers. You realise it is time to move on to your next encounter. Your next Bargain roll has a -1 penalty as word of your rudeness spreads around.
