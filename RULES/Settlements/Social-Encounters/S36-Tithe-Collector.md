Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Much to your dismay, you have caught the eye of a tithe collector, sent out on the official business of getting revenue for his lord or lady. This rotund middle aged man, dressed in good cloth as fits his station, carries with them a large book detailing the expected rates and payments along with a carved wooden seal which grants them the authority to charge a levy as they decide. You let out a sigh, because you know that once you have been entered into the lists by the collector they will seek you out again in the future. In the meantime it is likely they will charge you. Already, you can see the tithe collector is leafing through their book, no doubt trying to work out how much should be charged on a 'Character'. What do you do?
● Quickly, you try to dash away before they can latch onto you. Make a test against your Sneaking skill. If successful you manage to slip away unnoticed, but if you fail, the tithe collector intercepts you; add +1 to your roll on the table below.
● Try and talk your way out of it. Make a test against your Con or Law skill. If you succeed you convince the Tithe Collector that you've already paid your dues for this season. If you fail, he is upset by your blustering and increases your charge - add +1 to your roll on the tithing table below.
● Accept your fate and make the payment as required. It's painful, but the alternative is being thrown out of the settlement, so you grit your teeth and put up with it.
1d6 Tithe
1 The collector has mistaken you for somebody else, probably a peasant or labourer. You might be upset by this but on the other hand, it means he thinks you have already paid your due and leaves you alone - this time.
2 The man flicks through his lists, struggling to find a suitable reason for taking your money. In the end, he settles on a charge of one gold piece, but with the promise that he'll definitely expect more from you next time.
3 There is a bit of a discussion about what you should be taxed as and in the end you manage to convince him that you are basically a servant and really aren't worth that much. Your charge is a relatively minor 1d6 gp.
4 Waving his seal under your nose and generally making it clear that you are beneath him, the Collector eventually decides that being a sell-sword makes you a type of merchant and charges you 2d6 gold pieces.
5 The tithes have been poor this year and the Collector is looking to make up some of the shortfall. With a nasty smile on his face, he levies you for 4d6 gold pieces.
6 Perhaps the Collector was beaten up by an adventurer recently, because he seems to find all sorts of reasons to levy you - sword tax, armour tax, boots tax and so on - it all adds up to a charge of 8d6 gold pieces! It's a shocking fee, but what choice do you have?
Special: Attacking the Tithe Collector is considered to be an extremely serious offence. If you do take this choice, you must apply a -3 penalty to your roll on the Lawbreaker table, which must be done immediately, as the Watch keeps a careful eye on him.
Special: If all else fails, you may test your LUCK to avoid the tithe. If you succeed, a messenger runs up and he is called away immediately, but if you fail the LUCK test you roll again on the tithe table adding +1 to the result. Double taxed!
