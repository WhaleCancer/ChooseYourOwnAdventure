Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
The elven are a reclusive people and whilst not unknown they are a rare sight outside of their wilderness homes, so you are surprised to spot an elf sitting idly nearby in the shade of a tree. He seems to be quite at home and completely unconcerned by the bustle and chaos of the everyday human life around him. Perhaps it is some sort of meditation technique? Intrigued, you walk over and nod a greeting, hoping to find out what he is up to. What do you do?
● On second thoughts, this might be a bad idea. After you exchange greetings, you move on to your next encounter.
● Try to strike up a conversation. The elf is a little wary but still an interesting Character like yourself is someone worth swapping stories with. You sit down with him and pass an hour or two discussing the state of the world. Add +1 to your next Hunting or Forest Lore skill roll. By the time you have finished you are surprised to see it is near dark and you should find a place to rest.
● The elves are an arrogant lot and you see no reason why they should stand aside from the world of mortals. Walking over you confront him and demand he gives up any information that might help you. Make a Con or Leadership skill roll with a penalty of -2 unless you are an elf. If successful he offers up what he can - gain +1 on your next City Lore skill roll. If you fail, he mutters something in elvish and strides away, quickly fading into the crowd.
Special: If your Character is an Elf, you may choose to engage with him in conversation and learn what he has discovered about this settlement. You automatically gain +1 to your next social skill roll in this settlement. The conversation takes several hours.
