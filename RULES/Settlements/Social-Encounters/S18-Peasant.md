The world is teeming with peasants - those people who are just scraping by through a combination of common skills and physical labour, whether it be assisting a craftsman, digging the crops or just standing in a field minding the pigs, most people you pass in the street fall into this category. In general you go by with just a nod or greeting, but sometimes you stop for a longer chat. On this occasion you have come across a likely fellow, leaning up against a post with a pot of small beer in one hand and the general air of a man who is looking for a lost goat, but taking his time about it. What do you do?
● No harm in taking a break. You decide to stop and chat with them about nothing in particular - you can make a roll on the Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events tables.
● This lad might have seen something interesting whilst he was standing here. Make an Etiquette roll. If successful he turns out to be a mine of useful information and you gain a +1 bonus to your next City Lore or Etiquette roll. If unsuccessful, all you get out of him is a series of drawn out 'yaarrs' as it becomes clear he has had a few too many beers.
● Many peasants dream of living the adventuring life, maybe this one is up for it. You decide to inspire them, telling tales of daring feats, terrible combat and rich rewards. Make a Leadership roll. If you succeed, they will help you for a short time - they will assist you by providing either a +1 to your combat roll or social skills rolls in this location for the rest of today, after which they will get back to whatever duties their employer requires. If you leave this location, the bonus is lost as they go back to their work.
