Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Your eye is drawn to a heavily armed and armoured man who is sitting working on the edge of his sword with a whetstone. Judging by his demeanour and the crest on his shield, which is resting at the back of his seat, you guess that he is a knight-errant - a capable fighter that moves from lord to lord seeking out opportunities to prove their valour according to the knightly code. From the look of him, you think that he might be from Gallantaria. Even though he is wearing armour and a heavy travel worn cloak, you can tell that he is a powerful warrior and could be either a useful ally or a dangerous foe. What do you do?
● Knights and their codes of behaviour are troublesome. Avoiding his attention, move on to your next encounter.
● Maybe you could recruit him? Approaching the knight, you introduce yourself and explain your mission. Make an Etiquette or Leadership roll with a -3 penalty. If successful, he is impressed with your bravery and agrees to Come to Your Aid - you may call upon him once in this settlement, he will appear and fight alongside you for one combat. If you fail the roll, he listens politely but deems your exploits to be unworthy.
● Knight or not, you're going to knock the polish off his armour. You march up to him and demand satisfaction - he is shocked, but after a moment agrees to fight you, provided there are some rules. You will fight for five rounds of melee combat, whoever wins the most rounds is the victor. You may submit at any point (though he will not unless reduced to 3 STAMINA or less). If you should defeat the knight, he grudgingly hands you a purse of 10 gold pieces as your prize. If you lose, he lectures you at some length about pride and its dangers and your next Leadership skill roll is at -2. If you don't like his rules you can either attack him anyway (this will be an Unlawful Action) or sneer at him and move on to your next encounter.
● A warrior such as this must have some wisdom or tips that they could pass on, perhaps you can convince them to provide you with a quick training session? After introducing yourself and explaining your request the knight tells you that his services come with a price - test your Bargain skill if you are willing to pay the 2d6gp he is charging. If you fail the test your offer is too low and he grumpily requests that you move on. If you succeed the knight-errant takes your coin, agrees to spar with you and try to correct the flaws in your technique. Sparring takes several hours, so make sure you have the time to spare before you start. At the end of this class you feel you have sharpened your wits and loosened your arm, you have +1 to your combat rolls and damage rolls until the end of the next day. You may request this service if you meet the knight again, but only once per week.
● A knight from the Old World must have travelled far and wide and learnt a great deal. You resolve to sit with him and make conversation - make an Etiquette skill roll. If you succeed you can spend a few hours swapping tales - increase your World Lore skill by one permanently (this can only happen on your first meeting with the Knight, on subsequent meetings gain a temporary +1 bonus to World Lore). If you fail the Etiquette roll, he politely declines to spend time with you and asks you to move on.
