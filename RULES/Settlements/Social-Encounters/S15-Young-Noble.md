Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Before you stands a young man dressed in the expensive clothing of a noble: A blue silk shirt, leather trousers and boots, a belt with a silver buckle and a dark velvet cloak. He has a fencing sword strapped at his hip and an expression of mild contempt on his face. His every movement tells you that he is looking for an opportunity to show off his swordsmanship. What do you do?
● Compliment him on his fashion sense - test your Etiquette, if successful the noble will offer to buy you a drink! If you meet another noble on this visit to civilization, add +1 to any social rolls as your good name has circulated. If you fail, your attempted compliment backfires and he insults you - your next social skill roll is at -1 due to embarrassment.
● Insult him - make a Con roll - if successful he scurries away, but if you fail, he attacks you and you must fight (It is not Unlawful to defend yourself).
● Challenge him to a duel: He will readily accept, swishing his sword around with anticipation. You can ask for or offer surrender at any point - he will surrender if below 4 STAMINA. If you surrender he will accept but viciously cut your face as he does so - you suffer -1 Etiquette for a week as it heals. If you duel to the death it is an Unlawful Action and you will need to roll on the 'Lawbreaker' table.
● Attempt to inspire him with your tales of adventure: Make a Leadership roll. If you succeed you can call upon his aid once whilst in the Streets, Wealthy Streets, Inn or Tavern locations. He will fight with you for one combat. If you fail, he mocks your puny achievements and saunters off to tell his friends about you. Your next Leadership skill test is at -1.
