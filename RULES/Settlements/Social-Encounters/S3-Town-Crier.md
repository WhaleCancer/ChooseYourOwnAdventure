Hear Ye! Hear Ye! The town crier is making his rounds just as you happen to be passing by. Clanging his bell to announce the start, he has news to tell of goings on in this place and also from the wider lands hereabout. The fellow is wide of belly and red of face, dressed up in a taty livery that has definitely seen better days. His voice is strong though and a small crowd of people stop to listen to his pronouncements.
What do you do?
● Sit and listen for a while. This could be a moment to eat some rations, or just rest your weary legs. You may roll on the 'Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events' table (Chapter 8), this applies in addition to other rumours & events you are experiencing
● You listen to the Crier but also decide to work the crowd a bit to find out what people think of today's news. You may make an Etiquette Skill roll. If successful you gain +1 to your next City lore skill test from your information collection work.
● You listen half-heartedly but you are mostly thinking about turning this to your advantage. As he finishes you approach the Crier and offer him a bribe to include news of your Characterism in his next announcement! Make a Bribery Skill roll. If successful you must deduct 2d6gp but your next two Leadership or Etiquette skill rolls will gain a bonus of +2 as news of your valour travels around the city.
● You have no time to listen to tittle-tattle. Shoving your way through the crowd you head onward.
● You decide to take advantage of a distracted crowd to do a bit of pickpocketing. Make a test of your Sleight of Hand skill. If you succeed, gain 2d6gp but if you fail roll on the Lawbreaker table.
