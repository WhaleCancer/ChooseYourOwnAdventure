Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
A brawny farmer has brought his cartload of cabbages and turnips to market and is busy trading them to hungry peasants. His cart is almost empty of vegetables but despite that he seems to be grumbling about something and generally a bit upset with the world, stamping around in the mud in his thick work boots and pushing and slapping at his ass, which stands forlornly in the harness. What do you do?
● Neither cabbages nor turnips are of use to you now. Being careful not to catch his eye, you slide past while he is distracted and move on to your next encounter.
● Try to cheer him up with a bit of light conversation and stories about your Characterism. Make an Etiquette roll with a +2 bonus. If you succeed it seems to take his mind off his problems and in return he provides you with an explanation of the local farming conditions and best varieties of turnip and cabbage that should be planted. Gain 1 point in Region Lore - Plains (you can only gain this benefit once per planting season). If you fail he is just annoyed by your boasts and waves you off, move on to your next encounter.
● Ask him what the problem is? He quickly tells you that his cart has got stuck in the mud and he can't shift it. If you want to help you can make a Strength skill roll to help him shift it (if you don't want to help you can make your excuses and leave). If you fail, you are embarrassed and must move on to the next encounter. if you succeed you shove the cart out of the mud and he thanks you with a bag of assorted vegetables - gain two meals and you may Call Upon the Aid of this NPC once, but only when you are in the Marketplace or outside the city walls.
