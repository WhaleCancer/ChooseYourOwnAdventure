Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
It is clear that the man standing nearby is a soldier or mercenary. His battered face and muscular build would have been clue enough without the arms and armour he wears like a second skin. He is brooding over a jug of ale with a sour look on his face and hasn't noticed you, so you take a moment to study him. You can see that he has well worn leather armour and a spear with a brightly polished tip. His boots are large and stout, his tunic and hose seem to be in good condition. In short, this is someone who is ready for duty. What do you do?
● He doesn't seem to want company and you are happy to oblige him. Move on to your next encounter.
● Saunter over and introduce yourself, in the hope of exchanging war stories for a while. Make an Etiquette roll - if you succeed you can spend a while discussing battles and combat, as a result of which you gain +1 on your Combat skills for the next fight you are in, trying to put into practice the tips you've picked up from him. If you fail, he makes a crude joke at your expense and you retreat, embarrassed - your next Con roll is at -1 due to this humbling.
● You cough loudly and raise two fingers at him in the universal sign of challenge. Make a test against your Con skill. If you succeed you have taunted him into attacking you, and you can fight without rolling on the Lawbreaker table. If you fail the test he simply sneers at you and goes back to his drinking.
● Offer him 1gp to give you directions to either an Armourer or Weaponsmith - the next time you are in a location which has one of these as a possible map encounter, you may automatically choose to find it.
