Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
It is hard to ignore the extremely large wild haired man, dressed in furs and leather, that is striding toward you. Across his shoulders lies a large and wicked looking axe and as he approaches you he takes an enormous gulp of beer from a tankard before tossing it carelessly over his shoulder. Pulling his axe down to his side and stamping it onto the ground the barbarian points at you and speaks. 'You there, adventurer - come and show your worth! Stand and fight me if you dare!'. You notice a small crowd of bored peasants has appeared, seemingly from nowhere, to watch this exciting turn of events. What do you do?
● Oh, this looks bad. Before things have a chance to get worse, you turn and shove your way through the crowd and dash away as the laughter of the barbarian echoes in your ears. Move to your next location.
● Smiling, you offer a terse 'very well' and accept the challenge. Fight 4 rounds of combat with the barbarian. Whoever has lost the most STAMINA in that time is the loser. If you win, the barbarian thanks you for the challenge and offers to buy you a drink. Gain +2 to your next Leadership skill roll. If you lose, the barbarian still offers to buy you a drink and you part as friends. In the case of a draw, you may either move on to your next encounter or fight another 3 rounds of combat.
● Snarling, you draw your weapons. This fool should not have disturbed you and now they will pay. You fight the barbarian to the death. The crowd of peasants was excited by the prospect of some action, but left horrified at the casual manner in which you dispatched your opponent. Add +2 to your next Con roll as word of your savage nature gets around the local area.
● You are a poet, not a fighter: You try to persuade this hefty drunkard to put down his weapons and come for a drink. Make an Etiquette skill roll with a +3 bonus if you have any alcohol to offer him as a bribe. If you succeed, he recognises you as some kind of bard and agrees to swap life stories: you gain +2 to your next Forest or Mountain Lore roll. If you fail, he is angered by your attempt at friendliness. He grabs you mid sentence and hurls you across the ground leaving you in a crumpled heap. Your next Leadership skill roll is at -2 as your confidence also tumbles.
