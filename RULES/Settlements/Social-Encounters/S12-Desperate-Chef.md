Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
You are walking along a cobbled street when a nearby door flies open. Coming through it is a dwarf dressed in chef's clothing - an apron covered in food stains and a huge white hat that is barely staying on his head. In his hand he carries a cleaver dripping with meat juices. A waft of cooking smells blows out with him making your mouth water. The cook looks around, fixes his eyes on you and says 'You there! The Earl has arrived for lunch and we're shorthanded help us out for a few hours and I'll treat you to the tastiest supper you've had!' What do you do?
● You're an adventurer not a kitchen hand! Wave this bothersome cook away and carry on with your day. Move on to your next encounter.
● Sounds like a good deal...you pitch in with the chopping, pot-washing and stirring for the afternoon. The other kitchen staff are very chatty dwarves and are happy to talk about the local area. This knowledge means you may re-roll your next encounter, plus the chef does reward you with a hearty meal! In addition, if you succeed in a Leadership roll you spend the evening thrilling the cooks with tales of your Characterism - you may call upon the aid of a dwarven cook once whilst in the Streets, Wealthy Streets, Tavern or Inn locations.
● You accept the offer and chuckle evilly to yourself as you go into the kitchen. This dwarf will pay for not recognising your status. You deliberately put too much salt in the soup, stir some muck into the sauce and 'accidentally' knock over the waiter carrying the roast. By the end of the day the chef is in tears and an angry argument can be heard from the restaurant.
