S42 Townsfolk
The random encounter tables for each location are tailored to suit them - so you are more likely to encounter a priest at the temple than the jail - but there are some townsfolk which are found everywhere and there are some times, if you are using this book as an aid to running adventures, when you might need a random, non-specific citizen. Use this table then refer to the specific encounters. If you don't want to add an additional encounter at this point, you can ignore the 'Townsfolk' encounter and simply treat them as background figures, ignored as you make your way through the settlement.
