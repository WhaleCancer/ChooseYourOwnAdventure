Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
You have inadvertently caught the attention of two watchmen, who were standing about carefully avoiding any trouble to disturb their day. Dressed in armour and each carrying a wicked looking halberd, they saunter over and ask you what your business is. They don't seem particularly aggressive, just a bit bored but interested in what a stranger like you is up to. What do you do?
● Tell them you are a simple traveller going about your business and promise you aren't going to cause any problems. Move on to your next encounter.
● Tell them you are a bit lost and ask them for directions - make an Etiquette roll. If successful they give you a few directions and you gain +1 to your next City Lore roll. If unsuccessful they give you just one direction - be on your way.
● Getting The Watch on your side would be very helpful - you explain your predicament and try to convince them to help you. It is difficult, as they would rather go to a tavern than help a dangerous adventurer. Make a Law skill roll with a -3 penalty. If successful you may call upon the aid of one watchman once in this settlement (but not in the Catacombs). If unsuccessful they are suspicious of your plans and demand you move on immediately - you must move to another location at once.
