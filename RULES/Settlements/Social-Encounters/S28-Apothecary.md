A middle-aged woman is bustling along with the look of someone in the midst of a busy and demanding day. A faint clinking noise comes from one of the several pouches attached to her belt and you notice that her clothes are well made and at least moderately expensive. She is a few steps past you when she turns around and points her finger towards your chest saying 'You there! Are you here with my deliveries? I need them urgently.' What do you do?
● Mumbling something about 'Characteric deeds' and 'end of the world' you move off to your next encounter.
● Intrigued, you ask her about these deliveries. She is annoyed that you are not her courier, but explains that she is in need of rare herbs and ingredients. She asks you to keep an eye out for rare plants - if you do encounter any, you can roll a Healing or Herb Lore skill roll and if successful, take a sample that you can sell to this apothecary for 5gp each (maximum three samples) the next time you meet her.
● Spying an opportunity you tell her that you have her deliveries, but you have put them somewhere safe for the moment. Make a Con skill roll - If you succeed she pays you 5gp and says she will wait here whilst you retrieve them. You must take your illicit money and move to a new location. If you fail, she is suspicious and refuses to pay up. Your next Con skill roll is at -1 as you question your ability to deceive.
● You politely explain that you are not here with deliveries but you might be interested in her services. She is willing to listen. You may purchase a healing salve for 10gp that will either restore 2 points of stamina or cure one disease. It needs to be used when fresh (within the next three days).
