Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
A hunter has come to town to sell his haul of furs. Next to him he has a wooden rack covered in pelts and furs of a number of creatures, all cleaned and ready for working into clothing or some other household use. The hunter is a rough looking man, not young, with the hard face of someone who has spent many days and nights in the wilderness. Dark eyes look out from under the brim of foxtail hat and his long beard is braided into a plait which blends into his bear hide poncho. It is clear that he is a skilled trapper, but what does he know of the city? What do you do?
● You feel it is unlikely that he can help you, so with a curt nod you move on to your next encounter.
● Trade with him: He is not interested in buying anything, but you can purchase fur and hide clothing as listed on the equipment list in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebook. Remember to make your Bargain roll.
● Feigning an interest in his wares, you strike up a conversation to see if he knows anything that can help you. Make an Etiquette roll. If you succeed he shares some information about things he has noticed in the city and you gain +2 on your next Hunting or Animal Lore roll. If you fail he grumpily ignores you until you give up and go away.
● Wait until he is distracted with a customer and try to steal something from his rack. Make a Sleight of hand roll to see if you manage to purloin something. If you succeed you get a fox fur worth 2d6gp. If you fail, he notices you and attacks! You must fight him or retreat. Fighting him is still considered an Unlawful Action, since you were trying to steal his goods!
