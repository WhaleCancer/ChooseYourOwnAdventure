Hunched against the side of a building with their begging bowl next to them is the sad figure of a leper.
His hands and face are wrapped in dirty bandages that do not quite conceal the ravages of the disease.
A small bell is tied on a rope around their neck, to warn strangers not to approach too closely. As you pass by, they reach out a hand and ask if you can spare a coin or two. What do you do?
● This man has a terrible affliction and you are fearful of it. Pulling your cape across your face and holding your breath, you scurry past as quickly as possible.
● This terrible affliction has no cure, but you can ease their suffering. Being careful not to touch them, you place 2 gold pieces into their begging bowl and offer up a prayer to whatever gods may be listening. The leper thanks you; you may call upon their aid once whilst in this city, but only if you are in Slum Alley, Graveyard, Dump or Infirmary locations.
● Their very presence threatens you and everyone else! You curse them and strike out with your weapon, telling them to begone! The leper cries out and, grabbing his bowl, shuffles off in a pathetic fashion.
