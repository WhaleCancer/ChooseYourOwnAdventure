It is not unusual to see servants, alone or in groups, hurrying about completing chores for their masters. Most of the time you ignore them but this woman has caught your attention. She is dressed in the usual servant garb - leather boots, woollen clothing in several layers, a cloth cap and is carrying a lidded basket which probably contains firewood or clothes for washing, you can't tell at the moment. Something about her manner is unusual, she is a bit bolder than most of the downtrodden workers you see and isn't put off by your obvious aura of danger. As you look over, you see that she is also looking back at you with curiosity. What do you do?
● People stare at you all the time, mostly due to the scars and weapons. Pay her no mind and continue with your day.
● Servants are a good source of information. You approach and try to make small talk. Make a test using the Etiquette skill. If successful you may roll on Table 8.7 Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events and gain +1 to your next City Lore test in this location.
● It's rude of her to stare. You snarl at her and make a motion as if you are about to draw your weapons. Make a test against Etiquette. If you succeed she drops her basket and runs off. If you fail she is startled, but simply turns away. Either way, it is unclear what you have achieved.
