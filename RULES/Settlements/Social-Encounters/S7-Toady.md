If attacked, the Toady will attempt to flee on the first round. See below.
A well dressed man catches your eye, even though he seems to be trying to lurk in the shadows. He is looking around nervously and rubbing his hands together as if suffering from the cold and seems to be giving furtive glances left and right as though he is expecting someone. Looking him up and down you note that the clothes are well made but also well used, and have patches in some places and his skin is pallid and sickly. Still, the fellow might be a useful source of information. Perhaps you should question him?
● He looks too shifty to trust, leave him about his business and move on to your next encounter.
● Attempt to engage him in conversation by pretending that you know what he is up to; make a roll using the Con Skill. If successful you learn something to your advantage and gain a +2 bonus to your next City Lore roll, though if you fail the Con skill test the toady lies to you and your next City Lore roll has a -2 penalty.
● Hand on weapon, you try to corner this chump - but he has no stomach for this sort of thing and flees, flinging a small coin purse at you as a distraction. Gain 1d6 gold pieces and Move on to your next encounter. He is too much of a coward to report you, so you don't need to roll on the Lawbreaker table unless you encounter the toady a second time in this location.
