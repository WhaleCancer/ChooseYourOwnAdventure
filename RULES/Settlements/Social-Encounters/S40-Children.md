Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action and indeed it is considered so heinous that a -6 penalty on the Lawbreaker table applies.
You see children everywhere in the city, playing, running errands or helping out their parents at some trade or other. Here a group have escaped the clutches of the adults and are playing a game of 'guards and goblins' with the two sides pelting and taunting each other from either side of the street. Usually you would slip past them unnoticed but they have taken an interest in you and started asking questions about your equipment ('why'd ya have so many weapons?) and what you are up to (why ain't you out farming turnips? Did ya lose your pigs?) so it seems you are going to have to do or say something to get past.
● Nodding and scowling you (gently) shove your way past the juvenile inquisition and head on to your next encounter. You can hear sounds of disappointment as you leave.
● The safety of the city (and perhaps the world?) might rest on your shoulders but hey, you have time to play. You join in with the games for a while and relax. Make an Etiquette skill test with a +3 bonus. If you succeed you pick up some news about the settlement, roll on Table 8.7 Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events. If you fail, you had a nice time but eventually the children get bored of you.
● Curs! Rascals! With a flash of anger you growl and roar at the children - shocked faces look up for a moment before they scatter. Gain +1 to your next Con roll, but also roll a 1d6. On a roll of 1 the gods have noticed your cruelty and you lose one point of LUCK.
