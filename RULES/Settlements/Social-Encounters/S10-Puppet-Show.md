Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action.
The squeak-squeak cries of 'that's the way you do it!' and a red and white pin-striped booth warns you that someone has set up a puppet show to 'entertain' the children of the area. A small crowd of excited youngsters has indeed gathered and seem to be enjoying the show whilst bored parents stand around the edges of the crowd, gossiping amongst themselves. A grubbily dressed boy moves amongst them holding out a hat and asking for pennies. What do you do?
● This sort of thing just annoys you. Shuffle past as quickly as possible. Move on to your next encounter.
● Stop and watch the show for a while. Make an Awareness skill test. If successful you notice that as the boy goes around asking for pennies there is a girl moving amongst the crowd picking pockets! You may sound the alarm or ignore it. If you ignore it, move on to your next encounter. If you cry 'Thief! Thief!' the girl and boy make a dash for it, quickly slipping away into the crowd, but the 'actor' in the booth comes out with a club in hand and charges at you! You must fight. If you defeat him you win the thanks of the crowd for your honesty and the extra entertainment of the fight. Add +2 to your next social skill roll as your reputation spreads. If you failed your Awareness test, you are unfortunately a victim of the 'dipper' and must deduct 1g from your cash. What a show!
