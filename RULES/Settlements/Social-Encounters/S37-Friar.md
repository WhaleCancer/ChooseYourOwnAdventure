Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
In addition, if you do attack this devoted follower of Galana, then 3 Leafbeasts - see encounter C22 - will spring up from the ground to defend him!
A merry friar has come into town, on business for his monastery. He is dressed in the robes of his order - the varied greens of Galana - and a long travelling cloak, with leather sandals on his feet and a stout walking stick in hand. He has a well worn knapsack on a strap over one shoulder and on the other side, he has an unusual leather harness containing a small oak barrel, from which he is dispensing samples of the monks' work. A strong whiff of liquor wafting around here tells you that it is some sort of brandy or spirit that he is selling. Free alcohol is, naturally, attracting a small crowd of interested peasants and judging by the loudness of the conversation the friar has also been sampling his own supply. What do you do?
● It looks like fun, but you don't have time for it at the moment. Move on to your next encounter.
● You've earned a break. You join the throng and take a cup of the brandy. It is delicious but extremely strong. You can restore one point of LUCK as your spirits rise, but suffer -1 point of SKILL until you have a chance to sleep off the effects. The talk flows freely in this merry little crowd and you should roll once on Table 8.7 Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events to find out what you hear.
● You join in with the crowd but politely decline a sample of the drink. Instead you take the opportunity to quiz the friar, though he is mostly interested in the gods. Gain +1 on your next Religion Lore roll.
● Waiting for your opportunity, you ask the friar if he is capable of healing your wounds. Make an Etiquette skill roll with a +3 bonus; if successful he is happy to spend a little time bandaging you up (you may recover 3 points of STAMINA). If you fail the roll he is a bit upset at your interruption and asks you to go to a temple instead. A Priest of Galana automatically succeeds at this roll.
● You decide to have a bit of fun with this crowd; putting on your most menacing air, you start barging your way into them, knocking drinks out of their hands and shoving people around. You make it clear to the friar he will need to give you something to get rid of you. Make a Con skill roll. If you succeed he gives you a small bottle of fine brandy (worth 15gp) in return for you leaving. If you fail the roll - the crowd turns on you and starts pelting you. Take one point of STAMINA damage and move on to your next location before weapons are drawn.
