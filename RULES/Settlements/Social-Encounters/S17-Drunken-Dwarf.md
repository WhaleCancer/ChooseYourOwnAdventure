You hear a noise that you think at first might be someone choking, but it turns out to be a red-faced dwarf, singing loudly and waving around a half-full tankard of ale. In his other hand he holds a small cask from which he occasionally takes a top up. It is clear from his staggering approach that he has been celebrating for some time and is feeling the effects. He is dressed in a blue cotton shirt and breeches tucked underneath a chainmail shirt. A heavy warhammer hangs from a loop on his belt. He has a large foam flecked beard of curly red whiskers, and a mop of curly hair above a pair of twinkling citrine coloured eyes. The dwarf is clearly in a very good mood and offers you a hearty greeting. What do you do?
● Accept his greeting and share a drink with him, telling each other tales of adventure. Make an Etiquette skill roll, on a success he will gift you his tankard. It is a heavy pewter tankard, embossed with pictures of dwarves battling goblins and has the letters 'MM' inscribed on the base. On a failure, you depart as friends but with no exchange of gifts.
● Acknowledge his greeting but slide away at the first opportunity; move on to your next encounter.
● Cuff him away and insult his singing; make a Con skill roll; if successful he gulps down a big swallow of ale and scurries away, on a failure he throws the remains of his cup in your face and walks off laughing. Your next Con roll is at -1.
● Throwing your arm around him, you decide to join in the party. The rest of the night is lost to a haze of alcohol and song, you wake up the next day in a random location in the city. Miraculously unharmed but with 3d6gp less in your pocket.
