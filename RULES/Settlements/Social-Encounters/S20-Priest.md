Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
You spy an older man dressed in long patterned robes and a similarly decorated satin hat. He is holding a carved staff and talking to a group of nervous looking peasants. After a few moments he dismisses them and, as he turns to leave, notices you studying him. His clothes and staff mark him out as a person of distinction, but behind the hefty grey beard a welcoming smile has appeared and it looks like you have a chance to talk to him before he moves on. Firstly, you should make a Religion Lore roll with a bonus of +4 (priests do not generally try to hide their religion) and if you succeed, you know which god he follows and you gain +2 bonus to your social skill rolls for the remainder of this encounter (or, if you are the same religion, automatically succeed). To find out what religion they belong to, refer to section 7.1 which sets out how to choose a specific god for a temple or priest, or you can simply choose a religion that is appropriate for your setting. Now that you have the priest's attention, what do you do?
● Meeting an actual priest is a stroke of good fortune as you are in need of healing; you beseech him to mend your wounds. Make an Etiquette or Religion Lore roll - if you succeed he will heal you for 6 points of STAMINA. If you fail, he tells you that others are in greater need and bids you hurry to the hospital.
● Falling to one knee, you profess your joy at meeting a true servant of the gods; you offer him a donation of 2d6 gold pieces for his Temple (deduct this from your total). The old priest places his hand on your head and offers up a prayer of blessing; roll 1d6 - on a 5 or 6 the gods have listened and you gain +1 point of LUCK.
● He may look friendly, but priests are known to be cunning and greedy too! You nod at him before swiftly moving on to your next encounter.
● Temples have resources that could be of use to you and a priest will have the keys. You can try to convince this priest to offer you some aid - make a Leadership or Con Skill test with a -2 penalty. If you succeed, the priest gives you a vial of holy water - you can use it to instantly deal 2d6 points of damage to any undead monsters you meet (it has one use only). If you fail, the priest tells you that other causes are more needy and shoos you away.
● If you are injured you may ask for healing. If you are dedicated (you are a priest, paladin or avowed follower) to the same religion as this priest, or to a religion of the same broad alignment (good, neutral, evil) they will heal you for 6 points of STAMINA damage. If you are not openly dedicated to a similar religion you must test your LUCK to receive this healing.
● Engage them in a discussion about religious matters, something priests are always happy to do. After 1d3 hours you are able to bring the conversation to an end, but you do receive +2 to your next Religious Lore roll.
