Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action.
You come across a group of local traders and craftsmen, who are having a spot of lunch and a few no doubt well earned tankards of ale whilst discussing business matters. Although not at their stalls, this could be a good opportunity to get to know some of them and find out how the local economy is going, or just pick up some gossip. What do you do?
● They seem to be happy on their own and you don't feel like chatting. Leave them be and move on to your next encounter.
● Ask if you can join them for a bit. Deduct one ration or pay 2gp for your meal. You may make an Etiquette Skill roll to see how well you get along - if successful you have got the inside track on a few deals and may have a +2 bonus to your next Bargain Skill roll.
● You are not interested in trading but these people must know their way around. Offer to buy them a drink whilst you pump them for information. Deduct 2gp but add +2 to your next City Lore roll
● These soft goldmongers don't know the dangers you face to protect their way of life and it's past time they got a taste of it! Smash your fist onto their table and with a hoarse growl let them know how lucky they are. Make a Con Special skill roll. If successful, gain a +1 bonus to your next Bargain Skill roll due to your fearsome reputation.
