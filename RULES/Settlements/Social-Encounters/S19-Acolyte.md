Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Hurrying past you so close that you have to take a step aside to avoid a collision, a robed woman catches your eye. She stops to apologise for her haste and quickly explains that she has some urgent duties at the Temple, and that the gods must not be kept waiting. You notice that she has some symbols stitched into her clothing and some jewellery that might or might not have a deeper meaning - make a Religion Lore roll with a +2 bonus. If you succeed, you have identified which god she serves and have +2 to all social skill tests for this encounter (or, if you are the same religion, automatically succeed). To find out what religion they belong to, refer to section 7.1 which sets out how to choose a specific god for a temple or priest, or you can simply choose a religion that is appropriate for your setting. As she has now stopped to talk to you, what do you want to do?
● Her god is not your god. You ask her to watch where she is going in future and you move on.
● Engage her in conversation about her faith. Make an Etiquette Skill roll. If you succeed she is so pleased by this conversation she promises to pray for you at her Temple. During your next combat, you gain +1 bonus to your combat rolls from this blessing.
● Religion is for the weak willed, a fact you can use to your advantage. Make a Con roll. If you succeed, you have convinced her that you are also a follower and on a secret mission that needs her help. She will offer you either a donation of 2d6 gold pieces or the chance to call upon her aid. You must choose one option now. If you fail your Con roll, she sees through your ruse and turns away haughtily, promising to warn others about you. Lose 1 point of LUCK.
