Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
From the corner of your eye you spot what appears to be a living backpack. Huffing and clanking along is a large leather pack festooned with all manner of things; bits of armour, pots and pans, some tradesman's tools and at least one sword. Looking more closely you can see a pair of hobnail boots shuffling away underneath and above them what may be the tip of a shaggy beard. This strange creature stops next to a stone bench and with a huge sigh the dwarven pedlar puts down the pack that had almost entirely hidden him. He takes a swig of something from a flask, lays out a taty blanket on the ground and quickly starts placing his wares upon it. What do you do?
● You have no need for knick-knacks such as these. You pass quickly on to your next encounter.
● There's no harm in having a look. You stop and browse his wares. You may purchase any piece of 'general equipment' here at the normal cost, or sell any small items you have up to a value of 5gp
● This fellow must know a thing or two about the world - you decide to engage him in conversation. Make an Etiquette skill roll, with a +2 bonus if you are willing to offer him one of your rations. If successful you gain a +2 bonus on your next City Lore skill roll
