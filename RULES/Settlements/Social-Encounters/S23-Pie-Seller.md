'Pies for sale! Hot pies for sale! Get'em before they're cold, get'em before they're all sold!' Comes the cry of a wandering pie seller. Dressed in peasant garb, but with a greasy apron across the front, a young woman is carrying a cloth lined wooden tray filled to the brim with a wide selection of pastry topped pies. They are evidently freshly cooked as steam rises from them and a mouth-watering smell of cooked meat and pastry fills the air. What do you do?
● You've no need for food just now, so you move on to your next encounter with a grumbling stomach.
● Buy a delicious pie, of course! For the cost of 1gp you can acquire a large and tasty meat pie. Roll a 1d6 when you eat it - on a roll of 1 you have unfortunately ended up with a bit more sewer rat in your pie than expected, and you spit it out in disgust (the pie seller has moved on by this point - no refunds). On a 2-6 you get a delicious pie which restores 3 points of stamina (and counts as one of your meals for today). Yum yum.
● You want a pie but don't feel like paying for it. You can attempt a Con skill roll with a -3 penalty to wheedle a free pie out of her. If you fail, she is disgusted with your begging and moves on. If you get a pie, make a roll as above.
● You wait a moment and watch. As people jostle around her, salivating at the prospect of a well cooked pie, you could try to pinch one. Sliding into the crowd, you may make a Sleight of Hand skill roll. If you succeed, you manage to sneak away with an illicit pie (make a roll as above to determine the quality) but if you fail, your larceny is spotted. The pie seller slaps your hand away and the crowd looks at you suspiciously - you must slink away to another location.
● For whatever malicious reason, you have taken a dislike to this purveyor of baked meats. Rushing up to her, you whack your hand underneath the tray sending pies spinning in every direction. A look of shock on her face is quickly replaced by tears as she scrabbles around picking up the ones that are intact. It is time for you to move on, but with a penalty of -1 to your next etiquette roll as word of your viciousness gets around.
