Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Almost blending into the rubbish piled up in the corner you spy a shambling figure dressed in rags and leather patches, with a woven basket strapped to her back. She is poking around with a stick and from time to time hooking something up to deposit in her stash. Although dirty and unkempt, she has a kind face and you wonder what she might have overheard in her travels around the city. What do you do?
● As kind as she may be, that's not the help you are looking for. Move on to your next encounter.
● Smiling, you go over and strike up a conversation about life in the city. Make an Etiquette roll. If you succeed, you chat for a while and add +1 to your next City Lore roll. If you fail...even this lonely person would rather pick through trash than talk to you.
● This woman could be of use to you. You sound her out about some light spying duties - make a Con skill roll with a +2 bonus if you are willing to part with one of your meals. You can have an additional bonus of +1 for every 1gp you are willing to offer her. If you succeed, she is willing to keep an eye out for you. The next time you need to make an Awareness check in this city, you can succeed automatically as you have been 'tipped off'. You can't use that service again until you randomly meet another Scavenger.
● This could be a cunning disguise...avoiding her eye, you shimmy over until you are right behind her and wrestle the basket off her back to see what she is really collecting! Unfortunately, it is mostly junk and a tussle ensues before you let her get away - you grab one item (make a roll on the Everyday Items treasure table) but the embarrassment causes you a -1 penalty to your next Leadership skill roll.
