Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
Shuffling along with a wary step comes an old man, his beard as white as moonlight, dressed in several layers to keep out the cold and carrying a lantern topped staff in one hand and a bell in the other. As his light illuminates you, he stops and peers out from under the brim of his wide brimmed hat. 'Who goes there?' comes the query. The night watchman stands and waits for your reply, ready to ring his bell in alarm if needed. What do you do?
● Hold up your hand in greeting and reply 'just a traveller, coming home late' before moving on.
● Stand stock still and glare at him - make a Con skill roll. If you succeed, the old man quails and backs away, leaving you alone in the darkness. If you fail, he stands his ground and starts ringing his alarm bell - you must move to a new location immediately or roll on the Lawbreaker table.
● Greet him and, showing you mean no harm, go over and talk. He is more than happy to pass some time in conversation - it is preferable to patrolling the dangerous streets. Make an Etiquette skill roll. If you succeed you learn a few things and gain +1 on your next City Lore roll, if you fail you learn nothing and when you stop chatting, you realise that you have wandered away to a new location. Pick one that is adjacent to where you started.
● The job of night watch is poorly paid and risky - offer him 10gp and make a Con or Leadership skill roll. If successful, you can Call upon the Aid of this fellow, who will fight alongside you - but only for encounters at night. If you fail the roll, he takes the gold but makes no promises...
