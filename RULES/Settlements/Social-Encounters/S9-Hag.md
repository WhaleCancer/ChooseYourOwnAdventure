Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
What seems to be a pile of rags turns out on closer inspection to be an elderly woman, sitting on a low stool, clothed in layer after layer of patched and repaired robes. She is giving you a toothless grin and beckoning you over. 'Come and have your fortune told, traveller' she rasps at you with a voice like the crackling of dried leaves, flourishing a tattered pack of tarot cards in her other hand. What do you do?
● You don't believe in this sort of baloney. Move on to your next encounter.
● You are intrigued. Sitting next to her, you pass her a gold piece. She shuffles her Tarot expertly and lays out the cards, explaining as she goes, showing you a glimpse of what fortune has in store for you. Roll 1d6:
1-2 your future looks troubled and you must deduct one LUCK point. 3-5 the cards reveal a rosy outlook and you may restore one LUCK point. On a 6, a glorious career awaits you. Restore one LUCK and you gain +1 to your SKILL in your next combat.
● You go over, but tell her you would rather have information than your fortune told. She still asks you to cross her palm with gold and if you do so will reveal some of her secrets. You gain +2 on your next City Lore Skill roll.
● She's a witch! Get her! You draw your weapon and advance grimly on this servant of darkness. Her eyes widen and she gives out a scream before fleeing with surprising speed for one so ancient. This is an Unlawful Action and you must now immediately leave this location or roll on the Lawbreaker table. If you encounter the Witchsniffer you may give him the location of this hag to avoid him.
