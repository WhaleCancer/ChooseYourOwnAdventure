Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
You are approached by a neatly dressed and groomed figure, a man who extends his hand to you in greeting and starts to ask you questions about your life and exploits. He is talking fast and with a certain charm and wit. They seem to know that you are an adventurer and are fascinated by your Characteric travels, though you are not sure why. What do you do?
● You don't trust this person so you are going to brush them off and move on.
● You decide to engage them in a game of wits. Make a contested skill roll using either Etiquette or Con skills against their SKILL of 6. If you win, you convince them to help you out for the rest of the day - they will not fight for you but help you with social situations, providing +1 to Etiquette, Con or Bargain rolls. If you lose, they have talked you out of 3d6gp. How did that happen?
● Clearly this is some sort of ne'er do well, intent on causing you problems - you grab them and shake them vigorously to get your message across. Make a test against your Strength skill - if you succeed they are suitably frightened and flee, dropping 1d6gp in their panic. If you fail they wriggle out of your grasp and dance away, jeering. Your next Con roll is at -1 due to embarrassment.
● Something tells you The Watch might be interested in this fellow - you take careful note of his appearance. The next time you meet a member of The Watch or find yourself in the Jail or City Gate locations you can try and report him - make a test of your Law skill. If you succeed, The Watch gives you a reward of 1gp for the information, if you fail the test they have no idea who you are talking about.
