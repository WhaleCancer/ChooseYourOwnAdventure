Attacking this person is not an Unlawful Action.
A pathetic whimpering noise catches your attention.
You look around and realise that what you thought was a pile of refuse is a person, dressed in tattered rags and with a set of heavy manacles on their wrists.
You can see they have been branded on their face and arms, meaning that they must be an escaped slave.
They look up at you and plead for a little bit of food or gold, for they are starving. What do you do?
● Pass them a bit of food (deduct one rations from your inventory) and move on. You don’t have time to deal with their troubles.
● The manacles are large but ill-made. You offer to try and break them off - make a SKILL test using the
Strength or Locks Skill. If you succeed the slave is truly grateful and you may call upon their aid once at a later point, when in the slums or garbage heap locations.
● Slavery is a rotten business, but not your business.
Sighing, you move on to your next encounter.
● An escaped slave is probably a criminal. You draw your weapon and move to attack. Due to their status in society this is not treated as an Unlawful Action.
