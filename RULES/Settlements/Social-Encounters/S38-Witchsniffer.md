Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
With his wide-brimmed hat and silver buttoned longcoat of thick black leather, the Witchsniffer is an immediately recognisable figure. Working his way through the crowds, this tall man is as alert as a hawk. His dark eyes dart from person to person, pausing only long enough to scan them for signs of heresy and chaos. His gaze alights on you and he stops, evidently intrigued by the possibilities for questioning that you present. You note that as he is considering you his hand has moved to the pommel of his sword. What do you do?
● If you have unveiled the nature of the Hag (see encounter S9) you can provide that information to the Witchsniffer and they will allow you to move on unmolested.
● Nod respectfully to him and try to slip back into the crowd. Make a Sneaking skill test - if you succeed you have evaded him and can move onto the next encounter. If you fail the test he has kept an eye on you and you will be questioned as described below.
● Take the initiative - moving over to him you confide that you have seen suspicious activity nearby that he should investigate - make a Con skill roll - if you succeed he is convinced and hurries away. If you fail the roll, he will question you as described below.
● Stand defiantly and wait for him to make his move - the Witchsniffer shoves his way over and starts to question you. If your MENTAL score is zero, he will ask three questions. If you have a MENTAL score of one or more he senses your aura of power and will ask five questions. For each question you must test one of Etiquette, Religion Lore or Magic Lore (your choice). For each time you fail he will fine you 1d6 gold pieces for your lack of faith! If you refuse to pay (or answer) he will call for The Watch to deal with you and you must roll on the Lawbreaker table!
Special: If you are currently engaged in fighting The Coven, you can explain your situation to the Witchsniffer and he will be keen to help you. He will provide you with a charm (a small pouch of herbs and bones) that fills you with determination and increases your SKILL or MENTAL (you choose) by one when fighting witches. After giving you this help and some advice, he pats you on the back and wishes you the best of luck - indeed you may restore one point of LUCK.
