Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action.
A member of the nobility has taken some time away from their feasting and councils in order to take a jaunt around the city. He is a middle aged man, very well dressed in finest cloth lined with fur, riding a horse and surrounded by four pugnacious looking men-at-arms. He is holding a piece of silken cloth over his mouth and nose, presumably to ward off the smell and miasma of the less fortunate, some of which approach him asking for alms only to be shoved away by his guards. It isn't clear what he is up to, other than a spot of sightseeing. What do you do?
● It's probably best not to get involved with someone powerful. You let him pass and move on to your next encounter.
● Perhaps you could make a useful friend? Stepping out, you bow and attempt to introduce yourself. Make an Etiquette roll. If successful, the nobleman stops for a while and listens to your tale and promises to spread the word of your Characterism amongst his friends. Gain +1 bonus to your next three Etiquette rolls. He also hands you a pouch containing 2d6 gold pieces. If you fail the roll, he assumes you are just another beggar and his guards shove you away.
● Perhaps this wealthy man can offer you a job or become your patron. You move in front of him and, ignoring the crossbows pointed in your direction, introduce yourself as an adventurer for hire. You must test your LUCK - if you are successful the nobleman listens to your story with interest and, after some consideration reveals to you the location of a Catacomb (encounter M4) within the settlement (drop or roll a dice onto your map to find where the entrance is) that has been concerning him. If you are willing to clear it out - defeat all the monsters you find within - he will send a messenger to find you with a purse containing 4d6gp as a reward! If you fail the LUCK test he listens to half your tale before dismissing you as a charlatan, telling his guards to keep an eye on you as they leave.
● It's grossly unfair that this man should be so wealthy whilst others suffer! You step towards him and, ignoring the warning stares of the crossbowmen, confront him about the state of the city and demand to know what he is planning to do. Make a Con roll with a -3 penalty. If successful, you actually manage to shame him into making a few promises of improvements. You may add +1 to your Leadership skill, permanently, in this settlement. If you fail, however, the nobleman is upset with your haranguing and orders his guards to deal with you. They bundle you roughly to the side of the street and hold you down until their liege has moved on. Lose 1d3 points of STAMINA.
