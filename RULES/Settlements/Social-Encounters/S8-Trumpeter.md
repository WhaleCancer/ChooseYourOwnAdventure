You spy a young man, dressed in livery and carrying a trumpet. Clearly some sort of herald, he is currently taking his leisure and enjoying a mug of small ale whilst watching the world go by. Not a particularly unusual sight, but it occurs to you that a herald could overhear a lot of things in the course of his work and might be a good source of information. What do you do?
● March over and knock the mug of ale away, making it clear that he needs to spill the beans or there will be trouble. Make a Con skill roll. If successful you gain a +2 bonus to your next City Lore roll in this location. If unsuccessful the lad walks away smirking at you, take a -2 penalty to your next social skill roll in this location.
● You give him a little nod to say hello but otherwise leave him alone to enjoy his day. Move on to your next encounter.
● Stop and join him for a drink attempting to engage him in conversation. Make a skill roll (Bargain may be used). If successful you gain some useful tidbit of information that will give you a +2 on your next social Skill roll. If unsuccessful the conversation goes nowhere and he eventually makes his excuses and leaves, leaving you with a 3gp bill for the drinks.
● Hire his services? Make a Bargain skill roll, if you succeed he will, for a 2gp fee, accompany you for the rest of the day and announce your presence with a fanfare, granting you a +2 bonus to any two Etiquette or Leadership skill tests but making it impossible to use the Sneaking skill. You can dismiss him at any time. If you fail the Bargain skill test he is too busy to help you out.
