Sitting on a barrel at the side of a street is a girl, idly drumming her heels on the staves and looking around. When she sees you she hops off the barrel and comes trotting over with a determined look on her face. 'Hey you, Character - need to find someone? I can help!'. The girl explains that she is available for hire as a messenger and she is adept at finding people around the city, for a fee of course. What do you do?
● Confident you can find anyone you need for yourself, you shoo her away and move on to your next encounter.
● Ask her to find someone: For a fee of 1gp, she will go to a location of your choosing and find the person you are seeking. When you get to that location you can choose one of the social encounters from the list of those available. You can use this service once per day.
● Ask her to deliver a message: For a fee of 1gp she will take a message from you and deliver it to any NPC - as listed in the social encounters - in the city (this may help you complete your missions quickly). You can use this service once per day.
