Attacking these people is an Unlawful Action.
In a quiet corner you can see a pair of mummers (actors) who are taking a few moments to go over their roles. A man and a woman, they are both wearing large amounts of make-up and large awkwardly balanced wigs sit on their heads. From what you can tell the current scene is a very dramatic one, on top of which the pair appear to be somewhat drunk. At their feet is a trunk containing a variety of pieces of costume clothing and props. They are quite absorbed in their rehearsal but there is nothing to stop you approaching them should you wish too - they don't look dangerous after all. What do you do?
● Gossip from the theatre is unlikely to be useful. Dismissing them, you move on to your next encounter.
● Stroll up, put on your most charming smile and strike up a conversation with them. They are mostly interested in two topics: The social life of the city and themselves. Still, if you can make an Etiquette check you can steer the discussion a little. Gain a +1 on your next social skill roll and roll on the Rumours & Events table. If you fail, they mock you mercilessly and your confidence takes a knock - your next Leadership roll is at -2.
● Whilst they are absorbed in their practice, try to pinch something from their trunk. Make a sleight of hand roll. If you succeed, roll once on the Everyday Items treasure table. If you fail, they spot your larceny and start a hue and cry which is bound to attract the Watch soon. Give them a smug leer and move to another location.
● They aren't doing anything useful or important, so you try to recruit them. Make a Leadership skill roll. Success means you may Call Upon their Aid. In one future encounter. They will either arrive and pretend to be skilled swordsmen, distracting your opponent and causing them a -2 penalty, or they can help you out in a Social encounter, pretending to be your sidekicks and adding +2 to your social skill rolls. You can only do this in the Inn, Tavern, Drinking Den or Theatre locations.
● Ask them for some tips and tricks on the fine art of acting; For a small fee - 5gp - they will spend an hour or so with you showing you a bit of their skills and teaching you a few tricks. You can add +2 to your next Disguise or Con skill tests.
