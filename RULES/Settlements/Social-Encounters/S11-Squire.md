One of the best jobs for a boy is to be apprenticed to a noble as their squire. A general servant and dogsbody who will run around after them and in return learn the social and martial skills needed to be a member of the upper class of society. It is not uncommon to see them around town, noticeable by their attire, and you have spotted one such lad hurrying about his errands. For a moment he notices you and pauses, probably wondering if you are a strangely dressed peasant or somebody that he should be bowing to. The confused look on his face is quite comical. What do you do?
● You doubt that a child could be of any help to you. Move on to your next encounter.
● You decide to tease him a bit. Quickly drawing yourself up straight you play the role of an affronted noble, telling him off and demanding an apology for his rudeness. Make a Con skill roll, if you succeed he is convinced and grovels before you! The squire offers to help you for a while. At your next location, instead of rolling randomly for an encounter, you may choose a specific social (not map or challenge) encounter, as the squire fetches a person to meet you. If you fail the Con roll, he is unconvinced by your performance and simply nods at you before moving off.
● Although he is but a child, he is out and about in the city and talks to the other squires as well. You greet him and ask him what he is up to. Make an Etiquette skill roll. If you succeed you draw them into conversation and may add +1 to your next City Lore roll. If you fail, they are suspicious and shuffle off before you can learn anything.
