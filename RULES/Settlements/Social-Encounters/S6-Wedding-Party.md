In a world full of horror and misery it is pleasant to come across a merry sight from time to time. A wedding ceremony has just finished and the party, all in good spirits, are making their way to some house or inn to continue the celebrations. The bride and groom are at the centre of the group, holding hands and smiling at each other whilst all around them their friends and relations chat and laugh. What do you do?
● Curse them for their happiness and spit at the feet of the revellers. They look at you for a moment, shocked by your rudeness, before moving away hurriedly. Lose 1 point of LUCK, but your next Con skill roll gains a +2 bonus as word of your vicious nature spreads.
● Cheered by this sight you step forward and press 2d6 gold coins into the hands of the newlyweds, wishing them all happiness. Gain 1 point of LUCK.
● Although a pleasant thing, it's really none of your business. Ignore them and move onto your next encounter.
● A wedding means valuable presents, right? You may attempt a Sleight of Hand Skill roll to rob one of them as they pass. There is a penalty of -2 to attempt this theft due to the size of the crowd. If you succeed, gain 1d6 gold pieces. If you fail you are spotted and given some hard kicks before you manage to escape - lose 1d3 points of STAMINA.
