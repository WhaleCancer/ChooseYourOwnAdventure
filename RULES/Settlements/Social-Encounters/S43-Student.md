Wandering along in a cloud of frustrated concentration, book in hand, you see the robed figure of what must be a student. She is obviously making an attempt to absorb her lessons, but you also note that her other hand holds a jug of something with a distinctly beer-y smell. She is probably a noble of some kind - not many peasants can afford to send their children to school, let alone college - but it might be worth talking to her anyway. What do you do?
● What could a student teach a master such as yourself? Leaving her to her studies, you move on to your next encounter.
● Walk over and introduce yourself. Make an Etiquette test - if you fail she excuses herself and hurries away, if you succeed she gives you a long talk taking at least one hour. Your next Lore roll of any kind (except City Lore) gets a +1 bonus. Exhausted from nodding your head and listening, you move on.
● Students have romantic notions which you could put to use! Approaching, you explain your mission and it's dangers - make a Leadership skill roll. If you succeed you can Call upon the Aid of this student once whilst in the College, Hospital, Inn, Tavern or Wealthy Streets location. If you fail they are horrified back away from you before scrambling away.
● You've never liked bookworms. Striding over you knock the book from her hand and try to grab her beer - she holds onto that tightly. Make a Con roll. If you succeed she shrieks and runs, leaving you with a jug of beer and a book worth 1d6gp. If you fail she stands her ground and calls for the Watch - you should move on immediately, or stay and roll on the Lawbreaker table if you really want to.
