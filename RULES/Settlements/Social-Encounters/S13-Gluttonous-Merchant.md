Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.
You are taking a moment on a bench seat to quietly recover from the strains of the adventuring life when you are disturbed by the plompf of a heavy weight landing on the other end. You crack open your eyes enough to see that a very large man dressed in the attire of a merchant has sat down next to you and is busy tucking into a large platter of food - roast bird, bread, a bit of stew and gravy, steamed cabbage - there seems to be a bit of everything in this pile. The merchant already has a bit of grease dribbling down his chin, but he offers you a cheery hello and seems willing to talk (between mouthfuls). He even offers you a bit of his dinner to share. What do you do?
● Accept the food and the offer of some company. You spend the rest of the day talking, drinking and eating with this merchant who has many tales to tell you about the coming and goings of the local economy. Deduct 1g for the food and drink, but gain a 50% discount on your next non-magical purchase from his tips.
● This merchant should have let you rest. With a great heave you flip the bench seat up and over causing the blusterer to sprawl across the floor of the inn, landing atop his dinner. Make a Con roll. If successful he apologises profusely for disturbing you and scuttles off to clean himself up. Add +1 to your next Con roll as your reputation gets around.
● No one should be so bold as to approach a killer like you so casually. Attack him immediately - but he is no fighter and flees at the sight of your weapon. The kerfuffle has disturbed some of the locals and you can hear them muttering about calling the Watch. Move on to another location before things get serious.
