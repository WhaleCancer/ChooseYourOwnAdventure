## Settlement Challenge Encounters

In this section are the 'challenge encounters', so called because they involve some level of danger to your
Character, although some can be avoided by use of social or movement based skills.
Characters should consider how long it takes to complete an encounter - if you are in hot pursuit of a villain, you may not have time to attend an Archery Contest.
Temporary skill bonuses and penalties: Some of these encounters give you an opportunity to gain a bonus to a future skill use, though often at the risk of suffering a penalty. Such bonuses and penalties last until you use them (usually by making a skill test) or leave that settlement for a day or more. Remember that if you want to retire to an inn or drinking den to
'wait it out', you have to pay the cost of food and lodging.

## Standard Encounter Options

As a reminder, in Chapter 3 we detailed a number of encounter options. A Character may wish to use this (or others they can think of) to deal with the challenges they face.

### Table 3.1.1 Standard Encounter Options

See descriptions in Chapter 3 for more details.

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Fight | Begin combat and resolve it using the normal combat rules, you may use a ranged weapon or spell in the first round if you have spotted your target. |
| Flee | Run from combat; test your LUCK to escape or suffer a 'free hit'. |
| Sneak | Attempt to use Sneaking to get past your target, consider what bonuses or penalties apply. |
| Talk | Use a social skill, you must share a means of communication with your target. |
| Trick | Attempt to trick your target in some way, a variety of means including magic can be used. |
| Bribe | Offer your target an amount of gold to ignore your actions. |
| Feed | Offer an animal food in order to distract it. |

## Encounter Index

All challenge encounters have been moved to individual files in the `Challenge-Encounters/` directory. See the table above for links to each encounter file.

## Diseases

Unfortunately, the monsters of Titan are a hotbed of diseases and some encounters will grant you a chance of experiencing one of these for yourself. If you are required to do so, refer to the table below to see what effect your ailment has.
Diseases take effect from the morning after you contract the disease. Refer to the duration given to see how many days you have to suffer. Diseases can be addressed at the Temple or Hospital locations, for a fee. Once you have had a dose of disease, you will be immune to that disease (but not any others) for one week.

## Table 4.3.2 Diseases

| d6 | Disease | Effect |
|----|---------|--------|
| 1 | Gutrot | Your insides churn and swirl and nausea hits you in waves. Keeping down any food is hard and you may only benefit from eating rations once per day whilst you have gutrot. It lasts for 1d6 days. |
| 2 | The Shivers | Your skin feels cold and clammy and uncontrollable shivers rattle your bones. You must suffer a penalty of -2 to all skill rolls for physical activities (combat, jumping, climbing etc) whilst your body shudders. The Shivers last for 1d3 days. |
| 3 | Boils | Agonising boils have appeared on your skin in a number of awkward and embarrassing locations. Even with bandaging and ointment, moving can result in the sudden pain of a burst boil. Anytime you undertake a physical activity, roll a 1d6. On a 1 or 2 you have squeezed a boil and suffer a -2 penalty to SKILL for that round due to the pain. Boils last for 1d6 days. |
| 4 | Thunder Head | You awake with a cracking, throbbing headache and blurred vision. As you stagger out of bed, shielding your eyes against the light, you realise that the next few days are going to be a struggle. All activities that involve thinking (social skills, Lore skills, using Sorcery or Magic) suffer a -2 penalty due to your pounding head. Thunder Head lasts 1d3 days. |
| 5 | The Bubbles | Sounds nice doesn't it? Well it isn't. Somewhere inside of you gas is being produced at a tremendous rate and escaping out of both ends. As well as feeling bloated you are constantly either belching or farting, causing you to suffer a -1 penalty on tests of Etiquette, Con, Bargain and Leadership. The Bubbles last for 1d6 days. |
| 6 | Lice | Somewhere along the way, you have become home to a particularly fertile family of lice and you are now crawling with the things, causing you to itch and scratch day and night. You can ignore it in an emergency, but it does make sleeping difficult - you can only gain 1 point of STAMINA per night of sleep whilst suffering from lice, which lasts for 1d6 days. |
