# M5 Quiet Fishing Spot

**Suggested Maximum number:** 4

You've found a quiet spot down by the edge of a pool, where the roots of a willow tree provide a natural seat and tall reeds shield you from prying eyes. If you wish to, you can sit here for a while and enjoy the serenity as a break from adventuring.

If you have a fishing rod or net you can spend half a day trying to catch something. Make a Fishing skill roll with a +3 bonus, if you succeed you catch 1d6 meals worth of fish. If you fail, all you recover is a muddy old boot.

In addition, this secluded spot would be an ideal place to bathe - when was the last time you got yourself clean?

## Special

If your settlement is in a hot, dry climate you can replace the quiet fishing spot with a spot where you can use your Hunting skill to capture particularly delicious lizards, though you cannot bathe here.
