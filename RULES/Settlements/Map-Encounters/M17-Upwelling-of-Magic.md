# M17 Upwelling of Magic

**Suggested Maximum number:** 3 at any one time.

For those without the Second Sight skill, this spot will appear as a basically normal part of the settlement - perhaps they will experience a slight tingling sensation or wondering why the light seems to be brighter - but to those who are magically inclined, it is clear that something interesting is happening here.

Magical energy seems to be flowing from the ground in what appears to be a skyward reaching stream of scintillating lights. It is not clear what is causing this, but if you are inclined it is possible you could make use of this upwelling of magic, harvesting it to replenish your own reserves, though it may be risky.

What do you do?

- You push your hands into the stream and relax your mind, ignoring the looks you are getting from passersby, as you try to attune to the energy and redirect it into yourself. Make a test against your Magic Lore skill. If successful you can restore 1d6 Magic points. If you fail, you suffer one point of STAMINA damage as the raw magical energy reacts to your interference by burning you!
- This is a fascinating natural phenomenon, but for the time being you will ignore it and move on

## Special

The upwelling of magic 'contains' 20 Magic points worth of energy. After that is depleted it will disappear. It will also disappear after one week, fading into nothingness.
