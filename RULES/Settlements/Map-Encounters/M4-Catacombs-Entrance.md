# M4 Catacombs Entrance

**Maximum number:** See description of Catacombs entrance as a Settlement Location.

Trying to navigate the maze-like city you have become a little bit lost and wandered into a rougher part of town. The streets here are dirtier, the houses more ramshackle and the people dressed in rags and patched up clothing. You begin to feel uneasy when you notice a large group of young men coming along the road, muttering amongst themselves, banging sticks and clubs against the house walls as they go.

Concerned, you slip down a narrow side alley that is choked with rubbish. There is half a barrel leaning up against a wall and you duck down behind it hoping the mob will pass you by. Your plan seems to be working and as the last of the men pass by you get ready to move on, when you feel the ground shifting beneath you. There is no time to react as a large hole opens up in the ground and you crash downward through a cloud of dirt, cobble stones and rotten wood. The fall is thankfully not long and more of a slither across some hidden slope.

Coughing and spluttering you sit up and take a moment to check yourself, before looking around at your new surroundings. The hole you made is letting in enough light to see by. It appears you have slid down an old chimney funnel - of which only half is standing - into what must once have been the main room of a house, all now buried under the cities' current surface level. Around you, covered in dust and rubble you can make out some walls, a dirt floor, broken pieces of furniture and a doorway. There is no door, just a rectangle of darkness. For a moment you are sure you hear something moving around, a sort of scuffling, scratchy sound that sends shivers down your spine. Feeling uneasy you draw your weapon and consider your choices. You could climb back out, but now that you are here maybe you should explore some more? What do you do?

- Mark the location on your map but move on for now. You can return to this location to use this entrance at a later time during this visit to this area. However, if you leave this place for 1d6+3 days the locals will have sealed it up again.
- Drawing your weapon and readying yourself, you slide down into the darkness to explore. You should now refer to the Catacombs Entrance location in section 4.1 to help you create a mini-dungeon.
