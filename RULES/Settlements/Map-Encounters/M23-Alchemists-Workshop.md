Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.

You smell this building before you see it. A sharp smell causes you to sneeze and leaves your throat feeling scorched, as you pull up your cloak to cover your mouth and nose you spot a low wooden framed building with what appear to be scorch marks dotted across its walls. The smell is coming from a bright green liquid that appears to have just been emptied out of a window and is seeping into the mud of the sidewalk. The person who slopped it out is a round-faced man, noticeably missing his eyebrows and most of his hair, who gives you a cheery wave as you pass by. You can see inside the building there are racks of vials and ceramic pots and, surprisingly, a large selection of herbs neatly potted up and dangling from a trellis. What do you do?

- You've no need of a potion or salve today, so you nod to the man and move on.
- Moving over you stop and talk to the alchemist. He is friendly but strange - too much time inhaling fumes has left him with a wandering mind. After an hour talking to him you can add +1 to your next Lore roll (any type of Lore except City Lore).
- Alchemists often have a secret stock. Make a test against either your Bribery or Con skill, to convince him to bring it out. If you succeed you can purchase a vial of acid (10gp, does 1d6 points of damage to one target and 1d3 points to all those adjacent to the target, use Thrown skill to use) or a vial of poison (20gp, increase weapon damage by 2 for one combat or coats 10 bolts or arrows to the same effect). If you fail the Bribery or Con test, he is very offended by your enquiries and asks you to leave. You can only access the special stock once a day.
- Stealing from a shop which is partly on fire and partly dissolving in acid seems risky but you decide to give it a go. Make a Sleight of Hand test opposed by the alchemist's Awareness skill of 7. If you succeed you gain herbs worth 2d6 gp. If you fail, he spots you and gives you one chance to leave before he starts throwing acid - an offer you accept. You cannot return here for a week.

In addition to the other options, the Alchemist offers a few services.

## Services

| Service | Cost | Time |
|---------|------|------|
| Trading. You can purchase or trade herbs here, but stock is limited and uncertain. For each herb you want to buy, roll 1d6. For the first one, it is available on a 3-6. For the second component it is available on a 4-6. For the third or more it is only on stock if you roll a 5 or 6. You can return once per day. | Core rulebook | 30min |
| Medicine. If you are suffering from a disease or poison you can ask the alchemist to prepare a treatment, which will come in the form of a cup of oily liquid to be gulped down in one go. Roll to see what happens: 1-4: It worked! You are cured. 5: It didn't work, but there are no side effects. 6: It didn't work and you feel terrible - you suffer -1 penalty to all skill tests until you've had a chance to sleep it off. | 5gp | 1 hour |
