# M20 Crumbling Watchtower

**Suggested Maximum number:** 3

In ages past, perhaps as part of an older city wall, a watchtower was built here. It has largely been built onto and incorporated into other newer structures, but parts of it still remain including the stone stairs and eyrie (the roof has disappeared completely). You could, if you wish, climb up and use it to observe the nearby streets though it probably isn't entirely safe. If you want to ascend, you must pass a Climb skill test with a +3 bonus (failure means you can't find a way to get up). At the top, you can survey the area and gain a +2 on your next City Lore, Awareness or Hunting roll. If you do this roll a 1d6 - on the result of a 1, part of the tower crumbles under your weight and you must test against your Jump skill or suffer 1d6 points of STAMINA damage as you plummet to the ground in a cloud of masonry. If this happens remove the Crumbling Watchtower from your map, as it is now too damaged to be used as a lookout position.
