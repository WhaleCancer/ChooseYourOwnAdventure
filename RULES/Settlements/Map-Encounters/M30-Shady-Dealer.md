# M30 Shady Dealer

**Suggested Maximum number:** 2

You have stopped for a moment to consider your next move. Whilst catching your breath and looking around you notice someone coming out of a nearby building in a furtive and suspicious manner, piquing your interest. Next to a painted but dirty and damaged wooden door you can see there is a shuttered window. The shutters are closed but they are not of great quality and you can just about make out a lamplit parlour inside, which seems to be some kind of shop. As you watch a person approaches the door and knocks in a highly unusual fashion. After a moment you hear bolts clicking back and the door is briefly opened and shut and bolted again once this new customer has entered.

If you wish to, you can approach and try to gain entrance. You must test against your Secret Signs skill to mimic the knock you heard. If you fail the test, you see someone come close to the damaged shutter before a curtain is pulled over the window, concealing everything inside, and the door remains locked to you. You can try again the next day.

If you succeed in the Secret Signs skill test the door is opened and an older man with a long dark beard ushers you into his emporium. Judging by the manner of strange and expensive items, this is some sort of dealer in unusual items.

Here you can buy items from the Sorcery Spell Components and Magical Sundries sections of the Advanced Fighting Fantasy price list, but at twice the normal listed price. On any day that you visit, 1d6 items are available.

The Shady Dealer is not always open - if you return, roll 1d6. They are open for business on a 1 or 2.
