# M29 Auction House

**Suggested Maximum number:** 2

The sound of an auctioneer in full flow, chanting out the bids, alerts you to the existence of an auction house nearby.

It is an extravagant building, just an open space with a canvas roof held up by wooden poles under which an auctioneer stands on a raised platform, calling out the bids on a variety of items. To one side of him is the stock, available for inspection. It is a mix of everyday items and animals, seemingly assembled at random.

The auction appears to be public and you can attend if you want, either to buy or sell - they will auction anything up to the value of 50gp on your behalf and you can buy anything listed under 'Clothing', 'Transport', 'Livestock' or 'General Equipment' plus one Sorcery spell component.

In order to take part, make five tests of your Bargain or Evaluate skill and record how many successes you get.

- 1-2 Successes - items cost double, or sell for half value.
- 3 Successes: You buy and sell at listed prices.
- 4-5 Successes - items cost one quarter less than usual and you sell for a quarter more than the listed price.

The auction is not available everyday. If you come back to this location, roll 1d6 - the auction is in progress if you roll a 5 or 6 (only roll once per day).
