# M26 Workshop

**Suggested Maximum number:** 3 per location

A huge number of trades are carried out within the city, though most of them are of no interest to a Character.

Still, it may be that you come across such places as you explore the city and you may want to make a note of where they are and the trade they are carrying out.

Small workshops are very numerous - often a workshop is the lower floor of a house or a side building, with goods being either sold directly onto the street or sent to the marketplace and you can come across a place of trade like this in almost every part of the city, thus the maximum number is given per location rather than for the settlement as a whole.

Roll twice to see what kind of trade is carried out - roll once for the category and again to see what activity is going on.

**1d6 Category:**
- 1-2: Food
- 3-4: Craft
- 5-6: Everyday

**1d6 Trade:**
- 1: Butcher / Tinker / Weaver
- 2: Baker / Carpenter / Cobbler
- 3: Pres. foods / Stonemason / Potter
- 4: Brewer / Jeweller / Laundry
- 5: Spice Trader / Carpenter / Leatherworker
- 6: Wine Trader / Classroom / Herbalist

The workshops may sell directly to customers or not: If you wish to trade with them, make a test against your Bargain skill. If you succeed they are willing to sell you appropriate goods (use the prices as listed in the main AFF rulebook) but they won't buy goods from you.

All of the items sold by these workshops can usually be found in the marketplace.
