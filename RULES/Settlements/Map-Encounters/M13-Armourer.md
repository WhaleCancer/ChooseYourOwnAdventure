Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action. In addition, if you do attack them you cannot return to this shop.

You are ambling along when you notice an intriguing doorway. Steps lead down from street level to a well made wooden door set in a cut stone wall. To either side of the door are small barred windows and above the door on the lintel is nailed a shield with the legend 'Bogram's Armour' etched into it. The door is open so you decide to go down the steps and have a look inside. Peering around the doorway you see a small basement shop containing a number of pieces of armour (firmly attached to the walls) and a wooden counter going across the middle of the room.

Behind the counter sits a dwarf, caught in the act of munching on a meat pie. He has dark tanned skin, a very bushy red beard and the build of someone who spends a lot of time working metal, though he looks friendly enough. Behind him are shelves stacked with a variety of types and pieces or armour and shields.

What do you do?

- You have no need of armour at the moment - you apologise for disturbing his dinner and move on.
- You don't need his goods but decide to talk to him anyway. Feigning an interest in a decorated shield, you strike up a conversation with him. Make an Etiquette skill roll. If you succeed, the dwarf engages in a long explanation of the local cave system and you gain +2 to your next Underground Lore skill roll. If you fail, the dwarf notices you aren't going to buy anything and you end up leaving the shop.
- You smirk to yourself as you realise what a treasure trove you have stumbled into with just one paltry dwarf to protect it. As you move to attack the startled shopkeeper pulls a lever next to them and you hear a grinding noise - a large stone block is descending from the ceiling to seal off the entrance and trap you in here! Cursing you turn and dive back out of the shop before you are imprisoned with the laughter of Bogram chiding you out. You may not return to this shop and must remove it from the map.

In addition to the other options, you can ask the Armourer to do some work for you. He offers the following services.
