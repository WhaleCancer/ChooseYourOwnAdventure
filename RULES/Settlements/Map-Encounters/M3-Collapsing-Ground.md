# M3 Collapsing Ground!

**Maximum number:** Treat as Catacombs Entrance, see Settlement Location description. Ground is repaired after 1d6 days.

Spying a quiet alleyway you decide that it is probably a shortcut to your destination, and nip down it. This cut-through is a bit ragged and untended with many plants pushing up past the cobbles and piles of rubbish to either side. Just as you are regretting your decision there is a cracking noise, followed by a rumble which is followed by a yelping shout - from you - as the ground beneath your feet gives way! You must react immediately.

- Attempt to dive forward across the pit. You must make a SKILL roll using the Jump Skill or test your LUCK. If successful you may continue with your adventure, if you fail you fall down into the pit, suffering 2d6 points of damage. You may not use the Acrobatics skill to reduce damage as you have already tried to jump.
- Accept your fate and try to minimise the damage. You suffer 2d6 points of damage which can be halved if you make an Acrobatics skill test or test your LUCK. If you wish to leave the pit, make a Climb skill test - failure results in a further 1d3 points of damage as you slither back down.

Either way, once the dust and stones settle and you pick yourself up, you can see what caused the collapse. A large pipe - possibly an unused sewer - has fallen in upon itself, maybe sapped by the endless tunnelling of rats. The rubble hasn't completely blocked it and you can see the pipe continues into the darkness. If you so wish, you may use this as an entrance to the Catacombs (start generating a Catacombs map from this point) or you may ignore this and continue with your adventure. Mark this on your map as a Catacombs entrance.
