The familiar clang-clonk double beat of metal being worked alerts you to the presence of a smithy some time before you see it. Set back from the main road you see a well ordered workshop built around a forge that, even from this distance, is warming your face.

A pair of blacksmiths, one human and one dwarvish, stand either side of the furnace and are taking turns heating and hammering their respective pieces of work. A dog is lying near the entrance of the workshop, enjoying the heat. As you approach it looks around and barks once before returning its chin to the ground and the blacksmiths both turn to look at you. They are clearly busy, but seem friendly enough. What do you do?

- You have no need of their services at the moment, so you simply nod a greeting and move on. Mark the Smithy on your map, in case you wish to return here later.
- Both your armour and weapons have seen better days. You ask them what can be done, and in between blows of their hammer they offer you a number of services they can provide. They are very busy, so you may only choose one of these services each day. After you have made your choice and paid, mark the Smithy on your map so you can return to it later.

## Services

| Service | Cost | Time |
|---------|------|------|
| Weapons - the blacksmith will hone the edge of swords or rebalance your mace such that you gain +1 SKILL for your combat rolls in your next combat. This will also repair any damage to your weapons. | 10gp | 2 hours |
| Armour - the blacksmith will take your armour, knock out the dents and tighten up the straps and buckles so that you gain +1 to your Armour rolls for your next combat. This will also repair any damage to your Armour. | 5gp | 2 hours |
| Trading - the blacksmiths have available the weapons and armour as listed in the AFF core rules book. If you wish to haggle, make a Bargain skill roll. | As core rulebook | 1 hour |

- These fools have a rich store of weapons and not enough guards. Attack! Resolve the combat as normal. Should you defeat them, you can loot three weapons or one piece of armour before the commotion attracts the locals. This is an Unlawful Action and because blacksmiths are so highly regarded by their communities, you must roll twice on the Lawbreaker table with a -3 penalty. In addition, you may not mark this Smithy on the map for later use.
