Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action. In addition, if you do attack them you cannot return to this shop and you should remove it from your map.

In your wandering you have come across a shop selling maps. It occupies the ground floor of a modest wood frame house and in the window you can see a number of large maps of various locations in Titan, few of which you recognise.

The door is open and you can dimly see a middle aged woman sat at a desk near the back of the room, she is currently engrossed in a book and has not noticed you. Given your profession this shop might be a very lucky find, so you stop outside to take a closer look. What do you do?

- You prefer to rely on your own skills and wits, so after admiring the goods for a moment longer you move on.
- You enter the shop and talk to the map maker, asking if she has anything in stock that might be of use to you. She offers you a variety of maps, though they aren't cheap. You can buy maps of this location, or the wilderness. Each map you buy costs 20gp and fills up one inventory slot (they are large and unwieldy) but will give you a +1 on your City Lore or Region Lore rolls whilst you carry it. Each Settlement or Region requires its own map.
- You move into the shop but after talking to the map maker you realise these goods are way too expensive. If you wish to, you could use the Sleight of Hand skill to steal a map - you have noticed one that covers your current location. The maps are not an easy object to conceal quickly so the SKILL check has a -2 penalty. If you succeed, you gain a +1 bonus to City Lore SKILL checks whilst in this city, but the map does take up one inventory slot. If you fail the check, the enraged map maker bustles you out of her shop whilst calling for the guards, you decide it is time to move on. If you are noticed, you may not return to this shop for 2d6 days.
- You are lost in this settlement and need directions: For a small fee (5gp) she can direct you to a specific location - you can use this knowledge to choose a specific map encounter at a location of your choice. The cartographer is quite busy and will only give out detailed directions once each day.
