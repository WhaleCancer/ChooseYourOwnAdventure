Blocking part of the road is a covered wagon, from which spill a variety of spears, swords, maces and so on. As you approach you see a large bald headed man bartering his wares with a couple of peasants. A guard dog - very large and fierce - sits to one side of the weaponsmith, keeping an eye on proceedings as if it were the true owner of this business. It looks as if you are going to have to pass close by in order to move along, so you decide to slow down and have a look at the goods. What do you do?

- On second thoughts, your weapons are fine and the dog looks like it bites. You edge past them and carry on.
- Take a look at the stock of weapons and see if you can wheedle some information from the trader. He has a lot of knowledge about who is buying what. Test your Etiquette, if you succeed you may roll on Table 8.4 Chaos Unleashed Rumours & Events and add +1 to your next Bargain skill roll.
- Whilst he is distracted by some other customers, you could try and grab something. Make a Sleight of Hand Skill roll with a -2 penalty - the dog is watching you! If you succeed anyway, you may make off with a pilfered sword or mace. If you fail, the dog leaps and starts barking! You decide to flee before things get worse - move to your next location. You may not return to this shop for 2d6 days.
