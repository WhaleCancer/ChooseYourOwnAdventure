# M2 Small Well

**Suggested Maximum number:** 6

You come across a circular structure of worked stones covered over with vines and some small bushes. On closer inspection you realise it is a forgotten well.

Clearing away some of the leaves and brambles you can see that the well has water inside.

- You aren't thirsty at the moment, so you note the location and move on. If you pass through this location again you can make use of the well.
- Do you have a rope and bucket? If so, you can make use of the well. The water is crystal clear, cool and delightfully refreshing. Add +1 LUCK point for your fortunate discovery (only gain this once for each well). You can also use the water to wash yourself clean, if you are in need of it.
