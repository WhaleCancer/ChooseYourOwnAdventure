Attacking this person is an Unlawful Action.

Attached to the corner of a larger structure is the strangest little building you have ever seen. Although clearly made of brick, tile and wood in appearance it would seem to have grown onto it's neighbour like tumour or parasite. There are no straight lines or logic to its construction except that the door is, as usual, next to the ground. For all that it does not feel threatening or dangerous, more like the prank of an unhinged architect. You move closer to get a better look and now you can see inside - there is a fireplace, shelves full of intriguing knick-knacks, a table and chairs in one of which sits a bright eyed elf that is spinning an orb of light in his hand. He sees you and beckons you over. What do you do?

- This is too strange for you. Move along to your next encounter.
- Approach the elf and greet him. He explains that his name is Tym Po Nang and he is a travelling sorcerer. He has set up his 'shop' here (with full permission he is at pains to add) in order to trade and to teach. It's rare to meet an elf or a sorcerer and you stop to have a chat with him. Make a roll on Table 8.2 Winds of Magic Rumours & Events and make an Etiquette skill test. If you succeed you draw him into a conversation about the settlement and you can add +2 to your next City Lore roll.
- Nodding and greeting the elf you come into the building and your eyes light up at the possibilities for larceny. You may try to pinch something - make a test against Sleight of Hand as an opposed roll against the sorcerer, who has Awareness skill of 8. If you succeed you have pilfered a spell component worth 3d6 gp. If you fail, Tym Po Nang notices and with a snarl blasts you with a spell of his own devising - you disappear from this location and reappear at the Jail location. You must roll on the Lawbreaker table immediately, and may not revisit the sorcerers home for a month.

In addition to the other options, you can ask Tym Po Nang to help you out in some way - he offers the following services.

## Services

| Service | Cost | Time |
|---------|------|------|
| Trading. You can purchase or trade sorcery spell components here, but stock is very limited and uncertain. For each spell component you want to buy, roll 1d6. For the first component, it is available on 4,5 or 6. For the second component it is available on a 5 or 6. For the third it is only on stock if you roll a 6. You can return once per day to try again. | Core rulebook | 30min |
| Identify. The sorcerer can look through his books and identify magical items - he will tell you what they are and how to activate them, if that is needed. | 20gp | 1 hour |
| Training. The Sorcerer can instruct you in the arts of Magic allowing you to learn both 'MENTAL' and the associated skills. A Character must also spend experience points in the normal way to gain points in MENTAL and MENTAL based skills (such as MENTAL-Sorcery). | 50gp | 1 day |
