# M28 Stables

**Suggested Maximum number:** 5

The smell of manure and whinnying of horses tells you that there is a stableyard nearby. Looking around you can see an open set of gates through which you spy a number of stable lads attending to horses whilst a farrier works on re-shoeing one of them. This seems to be a well organised and respectable stable, which you could make use of. A young woman notices your interest and comes over to greet you, asking what manner of help you are after.

You can stable a horse here (1gp/day) or purchase any items related to owning or caring for your steeds, including purchasing a horse. See the AFF Rulebook for prices.
