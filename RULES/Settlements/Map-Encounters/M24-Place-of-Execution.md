# M24 Place of Execution

**Suggested Maximum number:** 2

A fearsome sight greets your eyes. At the centre of a small drab square there is a raised wooden platform upon which there are gallows and a large wooden block, the top and sides of which are darkly stained.

A chill runs through you as you realise that this must be the place where public executions happen. The square is quiet at the moment apart from the usual to and fro of everyday business, but before you carry on you take a moment to pray that you never end up as the entertainment here.

## Special

Roll 2d6. On the result of a 2 or 3, you have arrived just as an execution is taking place. Instead of a quiet square, it is filled to the brim with jeering townsfolk as the condemned is being led up to the block for beheading. There is little you can do about it - the large crowd is clearly excited by the spectacle and there are a number of Watchmen present keeping order. Your choice is straightforward - you can turn away and carry on with your travels or stay and watch the axe fall. Either way, deduct one point of LUCK for witnessing this grim spectacle.
