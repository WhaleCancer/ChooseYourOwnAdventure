Pushed up against the side of a larger building and indeed taking some shelter from the bigger structure, is an intriguing and well made kiosk. It consists of an open fronted hut under a brightly dyed canvas awning, with several well stocked wooden racks set about it. Sitting on a tall chair inside the hut is a contented dwarf, puffing on a large clay pipe.

She waves at you and beckons you over to her shop.

It is somewhat unusual to see a kiosk like this away from the marketplace, but you guess this dwarf has struck a deal with the owners of the larger building to let her carry out her trade here. Mark this on your map for future use.

This small store sells food and drink and everyday household items at the prices listed in the AFF guidebook (the 'General Equipment' part of the price list), but it doesn't sell or trade in armour or weapons - you will need to find a more specialised outlet for that type of item. After you have bought or sold (remember to make your Bargain skill rolls if you wish to haggle!) you wave goodbye to the dwarf and continue your travels.
