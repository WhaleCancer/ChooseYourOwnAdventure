# M8 Shrine

**Suggested Maximum number:** 8

You notice a small shrine has been erected here, no bigger than a window, built into the stonework of a building. A carving of a religious scene forms the main part of the shrine and it is decorated with candles and iconographs - wooden boards crudely painted with sacred images. It is clearly well tended, but there is nobody about at the moment. Moving closer you can try and discern which god it is dedicated to, and maybe make an offering of prayer.

Firstly roll 2d6; if you get a total of 11 or 12 the shrine is dedicated to the god you follow and you can pray here once each day to restore one point of STAMINA.

If not, make a Religious Lore Skill roll. If you succeed you have correctly understood the nature of this shrine and can, if you wish, offer a prayer in the correct manner. Roll 1d6 - on a roll of a 5 or 6, the gods smile upon you and restore 1 point of STAMINA. If you fail the Religious Lore Skill, you are praying to the wrong gods...roll 1d6 - on a roll of a 1 or 2 the gods have noticed your transgression and smite you - lose 1 point of STAMINA.

Once you have found this shrine you may mark it on your map. You may pray here at most once per week.

## Specific God

Whilst your settlement or region might be dedicated to a specific god or gods, people and small groups may still erect shrines to other deities. You can refer to Chapter 7 Political Systems & Religion, to find out what the dominant religions are and determine which specific god this shrine is dedicated to. If the specific god is one that you are a follower of, you will automatically restore 1 point of STAMINA by praying here, this can only be done once per day.
