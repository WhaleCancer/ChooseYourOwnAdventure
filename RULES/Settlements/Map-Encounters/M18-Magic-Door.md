# M18 Magic Door

**Suggested Maximum number:** 4

Upon a section of wall, someone (or something?) has inscribed runes of power, creating a magical door that can move you instantaneously across the city.

Characters that have the Second Sight skill will automatically notice the door - it appears as a series of gently glowing runes in the shape of an arched entrance which seems to surround a slowing spinning vortex of shadows. Without this ability, you must make an Awareness skill test with a penalty of -4 to notice the subtle markings. If you fail to spot it, mark it on your map anyway. You may retake the test each time you pass through this location.

Finding the door doesn't mean you understand how to use it. Test against Magic Lore skill to see if you can decipher the runes. If you fail the test, you may come back and try again once per week to see if you can 'open' the portal. If you succeed you know how to activate the door, but not where it leads and to find out you must step through!

Drop or roll a dice onto your map - the nearest location is where you 'exit' the door, into a quiet alleyway or corner where no one is surprised to see you pop into existence.

The door is NOT two-way. After the first time you have used it successfully, make a note of where it 'exits' so you can use it again in the future.

Each time you use the door, there is a chance that the winds of magic will whip you away to an unexpected location. Roll 2d6 - on a result of 2 you appear outside the settlement and should move to the nearest gate to re-enter. On a result of 12 you appear in the city but in the wrong place - drop or roll a dice onto your map to see where it is.
