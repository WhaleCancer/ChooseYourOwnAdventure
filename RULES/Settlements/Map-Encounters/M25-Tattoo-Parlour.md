# M25 Tattoo Parlour

**Suggested Maximum number:** 2

A brightly coloured awning has been attached to the front of a house under which sits a woman wearing a long brown sleeveless dress covered by a black leather apron. She sits on a stool; to one side of her is a table with a large collection of vials and stoppered bottles and on the other side is a large reclining chair.

Behind, on the front wall of the house, is a selection of wooden panels that have been painted in gaudy designs - snakes wrapped around skulls, dancing ladies and so on. In her hand she holds a shiny metal needle. As you pass by she gestures to you, inviting you to become her next customer. What do you do?

- Nod back and hurry on, you've no desire to get inked today.
- Go over and select a design for a tattoo - it costs 2gp for a small tattoo, which is permanent, of a design of your choosing. Make a note on your character sheet as to the nature and location of your tattoo. It takes one hour to complete the work.
- Inquire about any special services - if you have the AFF Characters Companion, you can ask for Magical Tattooing. Use the rules described there.
- Attempt to steal a bottle of ink - make a sleight of hand skill roll. If you succeed you have acquired a vial of coloured ink (worth 4gp). If you fail, you have been spotted and should leave to a new location before the Watch can be called! You cannot return to this shop for a week.
