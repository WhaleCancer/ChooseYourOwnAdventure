# M27 Bathhouse

**Suggested Maximum number:** 3

A soft tinkling of water draws your gaze towards a well made building, the lower floor of which is fronted with carved stone reliefs showing scenes of water nymphs, fountains and pools of gently rippling water. To either side of the door are carved sea serpents from the mouths of which pour steady streams of water, falling into bowls held in their tails.

There are no windows on the street front, but there are some grills carved into the stone from which wisps of steam are escaping. The door is open and inside you see a towel carrying attendant, waiting to take your money. The bathhouse offers you a chance to relax and clean up after your hard day of adventuring!

Here you can obtain the following services:

- **Laundry** - your clothes taken and cleaned, 1gp, takes two hours.
- **A dip in the communal bath** - warm water (either from hot springs or heated by wood stoves) will ease your muscles, restoring one point of STAMINA - 2gp.
- **A private room with its own bath** (fresh water) and a massage - also restores one point of STAMINA and costs 5gp.
