# M16 Devious Trap

**Suggested Maximum number:** n/a as they disappear once triggered.

Whilst the city of Khare may be famous for its traps, it is not the only place on Titan where devious tricksters set their snares to catch the unwary. There are as many motivations for this as there are traps; some do it out of spite, some in the hope of profit and others create them simply because they can.

Whatever the reason, coming across a trap can be a very unpleasant experience for an adventurer.

## Special

Once the trap has been sprung (deliberately or accidentally) remove it from the map.

You can choose to test against your Trap Knowledge skill instead of any listed for the specific trap. A success indicates that you have avoided the dangerous effects of the trap. You can make a second test against your Trap Knowledge skill in order to deactivate it. If you succeed in this roll you gain 1d6 gold pieces worth of components, but if you fail this second roll you suffer the effects of the trap as your fumblings activate it. Once the trap is activated or disarmed, remove it from the map. You may also test your LUCK to avoid a trap, as usual.

## Table 4.4.2 Traps

| 2d6 | Trap | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 2 | Acid Bath | A part of the ground has been rigged to give way, sending you slithering down into an acid filled stone bath! You can test against your Climb skill with a -3 penalty (the sides are slippery) or plunge into the corrosive liquid and suffer 1d6 points of damage (no Dodge or armour). Each round test Climb skill at -3 to scrabble back out or suffer a further point of damage. When you get out, roll 1d6 for each piece of equipment you carry - on a roll of 1 the acid has destroyed it! Only magical items are immune to this. This well concealed trap imposes -2 on Trap Knowledge to spot it. |
| 3 | Unstoppa-Ball | A neatly hidden pressure plate releases a heavy metal ball down a chute and straight into you! Test against your Dodge skill with a -3 penalty or take 3+1d6 points of damage and you are knocked down. The ball is worth 1d6 gp but occupies three equipment slots if you want to carry it. This trap is well made and using Trap Knowledge has a -2 penalty. |
| 4 | Vortex of Magic | When activated by your presence a concealed rune unleashes a vortex of wild magic. You are teleported to a random location (roll or drop a dice onto your map to find out where if you are in a city or dungeon). The magic also mangles you for 1d6 points of damage which cannot be prevented with armour or Dodge skill. If you have the Second Sight skill you may test against it to spot the rune before it activates. If you attempt to use Trap Knowledge you must take a -3 penalty due to the unusual nature of the trap. |
| 5 | Poisoned Dart | A wicked person has secreted a spring loaded poisoned dart in a gap in the nearby stonework. If you spot it (by making an Awareness skill test) you are able to jump out of the way as the dart whips past you. If you fail the skill test, you are stung by the dart and suffer 3 points of STAMINA damage as the poison sets your body on fire. |
| 6 | Chaos Rune | A magic user has inscribed a dangerous rune trap in this area - test against your Second Sight skill. If you succeed, you notice its emanations and are able to move carefully past it. If you fail, the rune is triggered and you are drained of 1d6 MENTAL points. If you do not have MENTAL points, you will feel a slight chilling but suffer no other effects. |
| 7 | Pit Trap | Amazingly, someone has dug out a pit without anyone noticing their work. Maybe they did it at night. In any case, as the ground beneath you gives way, you must test your Jump skill. A success means you have leapt clear, failure means you drop a few feet onto ragged shards of rusty metal, taking 1d6 points of STAMINA damage as a result. You may climb out relatively easily. |
| 8 | Spore Bag | A pressure plate has been rigged here, which when activated punctures a concealed bag of noxious spores which fill this area with a choking cloud. Test against your Acrobatics skill. If you succeed you manage to dive and roll out of the cloud before you are affected, if you fail you take a lungful of spores and suffer a racking cough for the rest of the day - you have -1 penalty to your SKILL until you have rested overnight. |
| 9 | Drop stone | Your movements see you blundering upon a tripwire which has released a large stone block from above you. Test your Dodge skill. If you succeed, you have quickly sidestepped the block and are unharmed (if dusty). If you fail, a hefty clunk onto your head leaves you reeling - suffer 1d6 points of STAMINA damage. If you wear a metal helmet, you take 1 point of damage. |
| 10 | Spray of Acid | When touched a disguised lever sets off a spring loaded piston that shoots a spray of strong acid over you! Test your Acrobatics skill. If you succeed you manage to dive out of the way before the acid soaks you. If you fail, the burning liquid causes you 1 point of STAMINA damage and also degrades your armour. Your Armour rolls have a -1 penalty until you can pay a suitable merchant to repair it. |
| 11 | Spiked Stick | A spiked length of wood has been rigged with a tripwire to swing out and impale you. You may test against your Dodge skill to avoid it. It is a crude trap and causes only one point of damage. |
| 12 | Broken Trap | Someone has already fallen victim to this trap - if you have Trap Knowledge you can scavenge 2d6 gp worth of machinery, otherwise you move carefully past. |
