# M1 Quiet Crossroads

**Suggested Maximum number:** 6

Wandering through the streets you come across a quiet space where several roads meet. In the centre there is a water pump next to a stone bench, with a weathered, vine covered statue behind it. Make an Awareness skill roll; If successful you notice that there seems to be a map carved into the base of the statue.

- If you noticed the map you may study it for a while attempting to memorise the layout of streets closeby; gain a +2 bonus to your next City Lore skill roll. You may also stop and eat a meal here.
- If you didn't notice the map, you may stop and eat a meal, but there is nothing else to be done here.

Carry on to your next encounter. You may re-roll to spot the map on one visit each day.
