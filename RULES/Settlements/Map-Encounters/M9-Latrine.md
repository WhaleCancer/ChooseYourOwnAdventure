# M9 Latrine

**Suggested Maximum number:** 1 per location, ten per city.

Whilst most 'needs' are taken care of by finding a quiet spot, some of the more generous nobles, desiring a cleaner and sweeter smelling city, will fund the construction of a public latrine such as this one. Two narrow wooden huts are placed back to back (one for men, one for women) over a pipe leading down into the sewers - or sometimes just into a pit that needs to be dug out from time to time.

That job is done by the surprisingly cheerful looking old man who is sat on a stool in a small wooden booth just by the entrance to the latrine, grinning and nodding at his grateful customers. A bucket and mop are leant up against his booth. For 2 silver pieces he will sell you a bit of moss or some rags to wipe with, but you can 'bring your own' if you want.

Inside the hut there is a single stall, with one long bench against the back wall of the hut and four seats available. The air is foetid and rank, with many flies buzzing here and there. It is best not to look down the hole if you value your sanity, but you can engage in conversation with your bench-fellows. Roll once on the rumours table should you wish to do this.

Every time you use the latrine, you must roll a 1d6 - on a roll of a 1, a Giant Rat is occupying the hut and you must decide if you wish to fight it (see the Giant Rat encounter C9) or hold on for now. If you do defeat this guardian of the privy, the grateful attendant will waive the usual fee and give you a handful of his softest moss as a reward.
