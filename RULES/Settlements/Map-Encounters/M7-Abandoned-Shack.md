# M7 Abandoned Shack

**Suggested Maximum number:** 6

With rotted beams that creak ominously in the slightest breeze, patchwork boards pierced by so many holes that it is no warmer inside than outside and a roof with enough tiles missing to ensure that hardly a patch of the dirt floor is kept dry from the rain, this lean-to shack has clearly been abandoned and left to decay.

Still, it is tucked up in a quiet corner of another building and out of sight from the street, so it is unlikely you will be disturbed here.

- You may rest here if you wish, without having to pay for accommodation. It is not entirely peaceful and you only recover 3 points of STAMINA instead of the usual 4.
- You may sit here for a while, clean your weapons, tidy your pack or eat your rations. You can hear the noises of the city around you but no one comes to disturb your camp.
- You can't miss out on this opportunity for wanton destruction. Taking your weapon in your hands, you start knocking chunks of wood and board away - a savage delight fills you and after a few sweaty minutes of hacking and bashing, you have reduced this hovel to sticks and dust. Brushing yourself down and catching your breath, you survey your handiwork one last time before continuing with your adventures. Is 'Destroyer of Shacks' your new nickname? In any case, remove this place from your map.
