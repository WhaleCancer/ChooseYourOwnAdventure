# M21 Forgotten Stash

**Suggested Maximum number:** Disappears when found, so no maximum

Caught in a daydream, you are surprised to find yourself staring at a small pile of masonry and old timber wedged into the corner of a nearby building.

Tilting your head from side to side you realise that there is something - a leather bag perhaps - hidden underneath. It is clear from the cobwebs and weeds that stretch across the pile that it has been concealed for some time.

After a quick check to make sure no one is watching, you delve in and drag out the container...but what does it contain?

Roll a 1d6 to see what you have found:
- 1 = nothing, the bag is empty
- 2 = roll once on Everyday Items treasure table,
- 3-4 = coins worth 3d6gp in total
- 5-6 = coins worth 5d6gp in total.
