Against a larger building and by the looks of it leaning heavily on it for support a cylindrical tower has been built. It is not large - only two storeys - but looks cosy rather than ramshackle. Around the base there are a number of clay pots with herbs growing in them, above the open doorway is a wooden sign stating simply 'Many Curiosities' and 'Welcome' and the faint whiff of pipe smoke is in the air. The room inside is well lit and close to the entrance you can see an older woman, in a well made woollen dress, sat on a wooden stool and holding a clay beaker in her lap.

In her other hand is a book that she is studying intensely. The rest of the room holds a stairway leading both up and down and a large number of shelves, stands and boxes covered in a wide variety of strange objects - many books, but also animal horns, glassware, strange bits of sculpture and many other things. Even more peculiar, you think you caught sight of a large bat-like creature hopping from behind a rack of clothing and up onto a high shelf. What do you do?

- The contents of this shop are weird, unusual and probably dangerous, you have no desire to get tangled up in this sort of thing. Move along to your next encounter.
- Jingling your coin purse to show you could be a customer, you engage the proprietor in conversation. She is quite happy to chat and the difficulty is sticking to one topic. Make a roll on Table 8.2 Winds of Magic Rumours & Events and test your Etiquette. If you succeed you have also learned something of the history of this settlement and can add +2 to your next City Lore roll.
- It's possible that she has something in her stock that might be of particular use to you. You ask to have a look around and move around the shop carefully examining the different items. Make a Magic Lore skill roll. If you are successful you find an item - pick one from the Adventurers guild stock list to purchase if you wish. You may only find one such item here each week, so make a note of it!
- Stealing from a magician is only for the foolhardy, but that is not going to deter you. Entering the shop you make smalltalk whilst looking for an item to pilfer. Firstly, make an Evaluate skill test. If you succeed you have spotted something of value and can try and swipe it - make a Sleight of Hand skill roll. If you succeed you make off with a small item worth 3d6gp. If you fail, her imp was watching you carefully and screeches out an alert! With a curse the magician recites a quick spell and disappears in a puff of smoke whilst the imp swoops into attack. So you must fight two rounds of combat as you head for the door and flee this location before the Watch arrives. You cannot return to this shop for one week.
- A shopful of treasures guarded only by a defenceless woman? This is an opportunity! Looking around to make sure no one is paying attention you move into the shop, close the door behind you and move to attack. The magician lets out a scream, drops her book and drink and then disappears in a puff of smoke! Her Imp screeches and swoops to attack. Resolve the combat as usual. If you survive you can loot some items worth 4d6 gold pieces, but you realise that the sound of combat has been noticed. Roll on the Lawbreaker table. You cannot return to this shop. Remove it from your map and move on.

In addition to the other options, you can ask the Magician to do some work for you. She offers the following services.
