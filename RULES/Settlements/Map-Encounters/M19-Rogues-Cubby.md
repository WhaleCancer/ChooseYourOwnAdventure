# M19 Rogues Cubby

**Suggested Maximum number:** 5

In order to spot this feature you need to make an Awareness test with a -3 penalty. If you fail to spot it, mark it on your map anyway. You may retake the test each time you pass through this location.

If you succeed, you have noticed that part of a building has been carefully and subtly modified to create an alcove like hiding space, complete with holes set at just the right height to peek through.

Judging by the cobwebs and dust the cubby is not often used and if your mission requires to watch or monitor an area, you can slide into the space and observe the settlement gaining a +2 on your Awareness or Sneaking skill rolls for this location.

However, each time you use the cubby you should roll a 1d6 - on the result of a 1 you have disturbed a Hobgoblin Spy (encounter C13) and must fight them!
