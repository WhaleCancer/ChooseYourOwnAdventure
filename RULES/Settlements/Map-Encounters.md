# Settlement Map Encounters

The map generated at the start of exploring a city includes the major landmarks and streets, but does not include details of every little courtyard, side alley or unusual building that you might find as you navigate your way around. On the encounter tables, you might get a result which adds a new feature to your map. These should be marked on in some way, as they are (usually) permanent features that can be revisited later.

To be clear that means once you have recorded that you have found a Latrine (M9) near to the Garbage Heap, you can return there any time you are at that location to use the facilities.

As you build up your settlement you can record details on your map or on a Settlement Details Sheet - see 4.5 for an example.

Unlike other encounters Map encounters can only be rolled a certain number of times for each settlement - a city can only have so many armourers before the local economy starts to suffer. The number that can be found is given next to the description. This is the suggested number for a city, you can add more if your city is particularly large. For a town or village, the maximum is one of each encounter per settlement.

If you roll the same result at a later visit to a location, it simply means you have ended up passing by the same feature again.

**Bargaining:** Many of the map encounters are shops where you can buy or sell goods and services. Unless the description says otherwise, you can attempt to make a Bargain skill roll to alter the price. A successful Bargain skill roll reduces the price by one quarter, a failed roll increases it by one quarter (round to the nearest gold piece). For example, if your Character is trying to buy a Long Sword at the Weaponsmith (M14). The normal price in a city is 30gp (as listed in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebook). With a successful skill roll that can be reduced to 22gp, but if you fail the roll the price increases to 38gp. Remember to apply the modifiers for Social Rank (chapter 7) and other modifiers as described in the core rulebook.

**Temporary skill bonuses and penalties:** Many of the encounters give you an opportunity to gain a bonus to a future skill use, though often at the risk of suffering a penalty. Such bonuses and penalties last until you use them (usually by making a skill test) or leave that settlement for a day or more. Remember that if you want to retire to an inn or drinking den to 'wait it out', you have to pay the cost of food and lodging.
