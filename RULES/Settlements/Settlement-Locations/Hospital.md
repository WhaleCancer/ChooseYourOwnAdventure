# Hospital

The everyday sounds of normal life are mingled with the pitiful moans of the sick and dying as you come past this long building, which is set back from the path at the other side of a muddy courtyard that is itself crowded with small shacks.

It may once have been impressive but it has not been well maintained and you can see it is dirty and worn, with vines creeping up the side and broken shutters across the windows. Above the doorway there is a carved relief showing a hooded skeletal figure with a scythe in one hand and an hourglass in the other.

As you watch you see a man pulling a laden handcart away from one of the courtyard buildings; the contents of the cart are mostly hidden but you can see a bare arm and hand flopping lifelessly out the back.

As the carter passes you, you instinctively pull your cloak up over your mouth and nose - the stench of decay is unmistakable.

Moving into the building are two robed acolytes, followers of Usrel most likely - they tend to the ill and dying as part of their devotions. By now you have grasped that this must be an infirmary or hospital. It could have been set up as an act of charity from the local nobles or from collections in the temples, but either way it looks as if its income is meagre now and the chance of healing is slim. The Hospital is the most important building in this locale, but it is surrounded by houses and workshops of many kinds.

## Special Rules

**Many cities in Titan have a place where the sick and dying are sent for care.** Calling it a hospital is an exaggeration in most cases. Little in the way of healing is offered and disease is rife. Each time you have an encounter at this location you must roll 1d6. On a 1 you must test your LUCK or catch a disease - roll on table 4.3.2 'Diseases' to see what you have contracted!

**If you have been unfortunate enough to catch a disease, you can try to find healing at the hospital.** Firstly make an Etiquette or Bargain skill roll to see if you can find someone willing to help. If successful you can pay 5gp for a 'cure' - a vial of foul smelling liquid that is brewed up by an apothecary. Once you drink it roll a 1d6. On a 2-6 you are cured, but on a 1 some mistake has been made in the preparation and your disease will now last an additional day. No refunds!

**You can try to find healing at the hospital.** Make an Etiquette or Bargain skill roll to see if you can find someone willing to help. If successful you can pay 5gp for the attention of a 'doctor' who will apply an ointment and bandages. Roll 1d6 - on a 5-6 the treatment restores 1d3 points of STAMINA, but on a 1 you suffer a reaction to the salve and lose one point of STAMINA.
