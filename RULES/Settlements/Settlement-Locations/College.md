# College

The area you are passing through is quieter and more refined than most of the city. There are no stalls and the usual throng of townsfolk has diminished significantly. The streets here are cobbled with guttered pavements and the occasional tree has been to provide shade. Pausing for a moment you take a careful look around and spy a bearded scholar making his way followed by several bored looking students each carrying books. As they pass, you hear the scholar explaining some obscure matter of local history. From the look on his students' faces, it is clear that he finds the subject much more fascinating than they do. It seems as if you have wandered into a college of some sort. A small precinct, created by the priests of Hamaskis, in which the learned men and women of this city can impart their precious jewels of knowledge to the select few that can afford to spend their time learning rather than toiling. It is not a natural environment for adventurers but it is a place where you might find out information that is useful.

## Special Rules
