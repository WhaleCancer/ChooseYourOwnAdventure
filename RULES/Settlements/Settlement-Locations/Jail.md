# Jail

A sullen and dismal air pervades this neighbourhood at the centre of which squats a large stone building, surrounded by high stone walls - the jail. Even the sunlight seems to dim as you approach it, your wanderings disturbing a crow in its feasting on a dead rat, making it flap up past your face caw-cawing angrily. The few people that you see are downcast and move quickly past, avoiding conversation. Of the building itself you can see mostly the walls and the imposing gatehouse which has two sombre guards on duty. They eye you suspiciously, it is clear that you should only approach if you have official business. The other buildings and houses in this vicinity have all left a gap between themselves and the jail wall, probably to stop prisoners from attempting an escape, but it gives the impression that even the stones and timbers are afraid of what lies amidst them. As you consider your next move you fancy that you can hear wailing and the rattling of chains coming from inside.

Whilst the Jail is the most important building hereabouts, there are also houses, a watchhouse and some rather depressing drinking dens and taverns.

## Special Rules

**The Watch are constantly bringing poor unfortunates to and from the jail, so if you commit an Unlawful Action here your roll on the Lawbreaker table has a -2 penalty.**
