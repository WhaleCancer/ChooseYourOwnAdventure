# Wealthy Streets

The houses here are large and well maintained; many of them have walled gardens from which trees and vines poke out or shady courtyards to sit and take refreshment. The street is similarly ordered and the cobblestones have been recently swept. There is even a raised pavement on one side and some sort of guttering to carry away the inevitable waste left by people and horses. You can hear the sounds of life from inside the houses but there are few people out on the street itself and most of them seem to be servants of one sort or another, hurrying to complete their chores. Occasionally a noble rides past, but they pay no attention to some scruffy looking mercenary such as you.

In addition to fine houses there are a number of well maintained buildings and spaces in this location, such as restaurants and clubs - the sort that don't want any scruffy Characters leaving mud on the upholstery.

## Special Rules

**The Watch is encouraged to patrol here frequently.** If you commit an unlawful action, you have a penalty of -2 to your roll on the Lawbreaker table.
