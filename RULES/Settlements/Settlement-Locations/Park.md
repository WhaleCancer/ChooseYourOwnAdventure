# Park

You have come across a wooded hillside, too steep or broken for building houses, that has been walled off and left as a semi-wild place within the city. Peering in through the gate, you can see a path heading off into the trees before splitting up into numerous trails.

As the ground slopes up ahead of you it allows you to glimpse some other features. You can see the head and shoulders of a statue peeking out in one place and there appears to be an open grassy area where some sort of vigorous game is being played - from the sound of it, a crowd has gathered to watch and cheer on the teams.

As you pause here and decide if you should go in or not, you can see a number of people, alone or in small groups, are strolling through the park and enjoying the scenery though you also note a couple of destitute peasants huddled in their rags under the shade of a tree, begging for alms from the wanderers. It might be a nice place to stop and rest, if you have the time.

Whilst most of the land within the city walls is filled with closely packed buildings of one sort or another, some land has been set aside as a place to relax and take a moment to sit or walk in relative peace. It might once have been a nobles garden, made open to the public as an act of generosity or perhaps the grounds of a temple that have been set aside for contemplation.

This doesn't mean it is always peaceful - various denizens may creep in and make their home here and hawkers visit to sell their wares before they get moved on. With no businesses to protect, the Watch do not often patrol here which can make it less of a place of peace and more of a centre for illicit activity, especially at night when the gates may be locked but the walls are still easy to climb.

## Special Rules

**The Watch doesn't get paid to patrol here often, if you roll on the Lawbreaker table add +2 to the result.**

**If you need to, you can sleep rough here and it is a little bit safer than doing so on the street.** To do so you will need to succeed in a Climb skill roll (to find a way in after dark). If you fail the roll you haven't found a way in and must sleep somewhere else. If you do sleep in the park, roll a 1d6 and choose high or low - if you choose high, you only get an encounter on a 1 or 2. If you choose low you only get an encounter on a 5 or 6. Use the usual sleeping rough encounter table if you have chosen a bad spot to rest.
