# Docks (or Customs House)

A sturdy palisade, interrupted by towers and a gate, surrounds this area set aside for the arrival and departure of trade goods. The taxes paid on these is the reason for the barrier - for the nobility, controlling that supply of gold is a major means of income and so it is taken very seriously indeed. This is a city within the city, with its own Watch and set of laws. Guards in uniforms look down on you from the towers and although you are allowed to enter, you know you will be asked about your purpose. The hassle could be worth it though - there is a great buzz and scurry of people bartering their wares, negotiating contracts and looking for work as porters or security.

## Special Rules

**Hauling goods is thirsty work.** Roll 1d6 and place a tavern (1) or drinking den (2-3) next to the docks as an additional map location.

**If you have decided that your city is near a river, lake or sea, this location is the docks and you will see from the outside the rows of masts and sail of the ships crowding the quays inside.** Groups of sailors come to and fro and the sound of sea shanties can be heard day and night. If your city is not near to a large body of water, this is a customs house and yard, where the trade caravans come through a separate city gate and you will see dust coated wagon handlers moving about in great numbers.

**The security of trade is taken seriously.** If you have to roll on the Lawbreaker table here, take a -2 penalty.

**If this is a Docks, you can hire a ferryman to take you to any location in the settlement that is also next to the water.** The fee is 1gp.
