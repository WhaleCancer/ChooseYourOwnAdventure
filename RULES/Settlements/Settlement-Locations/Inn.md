# Inn

A large well maintained building stands before you. It has a stone ground floor with a timber frame second storey, atop which a thatched roof reaches down to half-cover the upper, currently shuttered, windows. There is a large wooden door which stands open and welcoming, next to which you can see the trapdoor entrance for what must be a cellar. To the side of the building there is an arched wooden entrance to a cobbled stableyard, where you can see a horse being brushed down and fed. Above the door hangs a sign; the emblem of a black eagle on a white background. As you stand for a moment and consider your options you can hear the sound of chatter and the clink of cutlery on plates; a wonderful smell of beer and fresh cooked food wafts across the road towards you.

The Inn is not the only building in this area; there are other places to eat and drink, houses and small shops and workshops here, but this large and well appointed Inn is the most important and notable establishment.
