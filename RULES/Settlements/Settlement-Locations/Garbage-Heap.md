# Garbage Heap

Congratulations, you have found the town dump! In truth, your nose had alerted you to its presence some time before you saw it, but now here it is in all its rat infested glory. The alley you were passing down has become a rutted mud track, carved up by the numerous small carts of the rag-and-bone men who use this trash heap daily. The dump itself is a fenced off area that was perhaps at some time a quarry or natural sinkhole and is now filled to the brim (and then some) with all manner of rubbish. Fat, vicious looking rats scurry to and fro around the pile whilst some miserable looking peasants, large baskets strapped to their backs, can be seen picking their way through the detritus in search of something to sell.

Off to one side you can see a tumbledown single room shack, in front of which sits a crusty old dwarf who is, you guess, the owner or guard of the dump. He is sitting in a broken old chair and is fast asleep, snoring loudly, with a tankard on the ground next to him.

The most notable feature of this area is the large pile of rubbish and discarded things but there are also some rundown shacks and other decaying buildings - this whole part of the settlement seems to be settling back into the dirt.
