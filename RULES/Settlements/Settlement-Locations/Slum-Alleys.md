# Slum Alleys

Cobblestones have given way to mud and straw and well ordered buildings are replaced by lean-to shacks and precariously designed houses where rotting timbers surround patched and hole ridden boards.

A miasma of mould and refuse hangs thick in the air and the people you see scurry past with hunger worn into their pinched faces. A group of soot faced children stare at you and as you look back, you can see they are playing a game with what appears to be a couple of dead rats.

You have passed into the slums. There is life and opportunity here, but also danger, so beware.

## Special Rules

**The Watch rarely bothers coming here.** If you commit an unlawful action, add +3 to your roll on the Lawbreaker table.
