# Marketplace

Even before you got to the broad yard filled with stalls, you had been struggling past the crowds of carters, porters and street-hawkers that filled the streets. The shouts of trading, smells from the food stalls and the goods piled high amounts to a sensory overload that leaves you stunned. Gathering yourself you press on and look around to see if there is anything of interest to you. The market is set up in a large area at the confluence of many streets. Around it there are houses and shops, and most have some form of stall or display at the front. Inside are kiosks, stalls, barrows and even carpets with goods laid out on them, arranged by the simple rule of seeing how much you can squeeze into the space available whilst still leaving paths for customers to walk down.

Traders guard their wares and shout out the prices of their stock in well practised calls. Children tug at your clothing, asking you to come see what their parents have to have for sale as Watchmen move through the crowd looking out for pick-pockets. You see piles of vegetables on carts, chickens in cages, yards of cloth laid out and many other things besides.

## Special Rules

**At the Marketplace it is assumed that you are able to buy any of the standard goods listed in the AFF rulebook and to sell any goods you no longer require.** Remember to make your Bargain skill tests (assume that the traders have Bargain 7). Trading like this does not count as an encounter, but should be expected to take some time as you haggle over prices.

**The marketplace is so crowded that just by wandering it, you can overhear a lot.** If you wish to, spend an hour eavesdropping and you can roll once on table 8.7 'Trivia & Gossip - Rumours & Events'.
