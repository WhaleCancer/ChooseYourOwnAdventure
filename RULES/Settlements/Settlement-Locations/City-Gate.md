# City Gate (Wall)

You've seen it looming on the skyline for some time now, so it's no surprise when you turn a corner and find yourself staring at the base of the city wall.

Looking up you can see the edge of the battlements and can hear the tramping of the guards boots as they make their endless circuits. Passing along a small alley past some lean-to shacks you find yourself approaching a gate house. It is a formidable structure - the equal of any castle tower, with an inner and outer gate protected by guards that use their halberds to poke and prod at the carts rolling by. Occasionally they stop someone and pull them over for a closer inspection, but they don't look too interested in the job, mostly doing it to keep happy the captain that is sat on a chair at the door of the guardhouse, a tankard resting on his belly.

Whilst the City Gate dominates this part of the settlement, it is also surrounded by houses, workshops and small places to eat and drink.

## Special Rules

**With so many guards about, if you take an Unlawful Action at this location, you must take a penalty of -3 for your roll on the Lawbreaker table.**

**The Gate is shut at night. If you approach this location at night, you cannot pass through the gate.**

**A tariff is occasionally charged on gate traffic. Roll a 1d6. On a 1, you must pay 2gp to pass through the gate. If you don't have the gold, you are turned back.**
