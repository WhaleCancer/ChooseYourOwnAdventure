# Keep

The narrow streets open up ahead of you into a wide courtyard, at the far side of which stands the forbidding bulk of the keep. A large building of neatly cut grey stone, it has an outer wall with crenellated battlements, a watchtower at each corner and a single main gate large enough to accommodate wagons or, more importantly, a squad of soldiers.

The doors of the gate are currently open and you can see past the guardsmen to the inner courtyard and the keep itself - a severe looking block of thick stone pierced by narrow windows and recessed heavy oak doors. Unsurprisingly there is a lot of activity here - at the inner courtyard you can see a wagoneer unloading barrels with the help of some uniformed servants, atop the outer wall there are guards on lookout, resting their crossbows against the tops of the battlements. At the main gate there are more guards and a small knot of soldiers and traders haggling over something or other whilst a squad of recruits practises a combat drill in the outer courtyard, watched over by a grey haired instructor. The clang of sword on shield is punctuated only by his words of advice to the young men of the garrison.

Around the edge of this area, a little back from the keep, life carries on as normal with peasants and servants hurrying about their business and even a couple of hawkers trying to interest the soldiers in a pie or an ale. Although not as busy as the marketplace, this is still a hub of activity.
