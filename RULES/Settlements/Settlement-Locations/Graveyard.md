# Graveyard

A chill runs down your spine and the air seems to cool as you come to a low stone wall surrounding a dreary graveyard. A few stunted trees grow here and there and moss and creepers have worked their way across each stone marker, which are placed close together like rotten teeth in a giant's jawbone. A solitary crow looks up at you before hopping away to resume its search for juicy corpse fed worms. Further along the wall there is a covered wooden gateway, carved with symbols of death, through which you may enter if you dare - the dead do not always sleep soundly.

The Graveyard dominates this area, but there are also a few houses and other everyday buildings dotted around its edge.

## Special Rules

**The Watch are as superstitious as anyone else.** If you have to roll on the Lawbreaker table, add +3 to the result in this location as they are unwilling to enter.
