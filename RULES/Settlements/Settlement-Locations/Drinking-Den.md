# Drinking Den

You are passing a nondescript building when you notice the doorway is open. As you come close a strong stench of beer, pipe smoke and stale sweat assails you and you hear the sound of laughter and out of tune singing. Looking more carefully you see there is a painted wooden board nailed to the timbers above the doorway depicting a severed hand, dripping blood onto three barrels. There is no writing. Inside, the first floor of this building has been turned into a single long room with a fire at one end and a bar at the other. Straw and dirt covers the floor, cheap looking wooden benches and stools are arranged haphazardly about the place and a number of labourers are slumped in their chairs slurping down their ale. A large bald headed man with extraordinarily bushy red sideburns is carrying two handfuls of freshly filled tankards over to one group.

He is singing lustily and in the firelight his face takes on a demonic aspect - are you tempted to step inside?

It looks like a good place for a cheap meal and a drink, but you doubt that trouble is hard to come by either. Whilst the Drinking Den is the most noticeable part of this area there are also poor houses, ramshackle warehouses, bawdy houses etc.

## Special Rules

**Make sure to pick a suitably horrible name for this location when you create it.** Something along the lines of 'The Hanged Rat' or 'The Bag of Brains'.

**You can stop and rest at a Drinking Den, single rooms are 1gp a night, a meal is 1gp and stabling is 1gp a night.** If you do stay the night roll 1d6. On a result of 1, you lose a random item from your inventory.
