# Tavern

Occupying a large corner house at the intersection of two streets, you see a tavern. A sign painted on a wooden board proclaims it to be the 'Rose & Crown' and someone has indeed attempted to paint both those objects in gaudy colours below the name. There are two doorways, both open, and outside on the street a couple of benches are pushed up against the wall. Both are occupied by labourers of some kind who are supping their ales and generally enjoying a moment's rest from their work. The tavern has two storeys and as you get closer you can see that the bottom level is taken up by two bar rooms, each with its own fireplace, whilst the top level (from what you can see through the windows) seems to be a sleeping room divided up with cloth screens. In general this seems like a decent place to get some food and rest.

The Tavern is not the only building in this area; it is in fact simply the largest building in a row consisting of houses, small shops and workshops. However, most people know this area by reference to this tavern which has become a local landmark.
