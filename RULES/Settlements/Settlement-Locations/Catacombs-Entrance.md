# Catacombs Entrance

Many of the cities of Titan are very old and over the span of centuries people have often simply built on top of older structures rather than bother clearing them away. In addition, there are sewers, dungeons, covered over streams, crypts, caves and all manner of cellars, tunnels and delvings. Sometimes these underground spaces join up to create a hidden city under the feet of the unknowing surface dwellers.

Collectively these places are known as catacombs, where all manner of dark and sinister activities take place. Most of the time the people block up or seal the entrances to these dangerous places, but sometimes a natural collapse, or something digging out from inside the catacomb, opens them up again. Having discovered a way into a catacomb you may now, if you wish, venture inside and explore it.

## Generating a Catacomb

A catacomb is essentially a mini dungeon and you should read 'Chapter 5. Dungeon Creation & Encounters' to see what options are available to you, but the intention of a catacomb is to make a small structure containing 3+1d6 rooms - just one dungeon section. After clearing all these rooms you can test against your Underground Lore skill to discover more and if you succeed you find a way to access another 1d6 rooms (maybe you find a collapsing wall or a concealed tunnel that leads deeper into the caves and so on). You can keep trying to discover more areas, but each subsequent test of Underground Lore has a penalty of -3, then -6 and so on.

If you wish to explore the catacomb, you have two choices. You can use the detailed options provided in Chapter 5 'Dungeon Creation & Encounters' or, if you do not want to create a separate map, you can treat it as a series of rooms with 'abbreviated' dungeon creation rules. Simply assume that each room is connected to the next in a fairly obvious manner and use the following tables to find out what each contains. Roll 1d6 on each table for each room and proceed as far as you dare!

Roll once on Table 4.1.25 Catacomb Origin, Table 4.1.26 Catacomb Condition and Table 4.1.27 Creature Condition to find out what sort of environment you are entering and what modifiers you need to be aware of. As you move to each room, roll on Table 4.1.28 Catacomb Encounters to see what it contains.

This is a very shortened version of the more extensive rules given in Chapter 5.

## Table 4.1.25 Catacomb Origin. Roll once for the whole catacomb.

| 1d6 | Origin | Monsters (if encountered, see encounters table below)* |
|-----|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Cellars - This was once a cellar or basement of a great house that has been long abandoned and fallen into disrepair. The environment was built for people but it is also littered with the rubbish and detritus, such as broken bits of furniture, that got shoved down here before it was forgotten. | 1 - C19 Ravenous Slime, 2 - C25 Skeleton, 3-4 - C9 Giant Rat, 5-6 - C20 Giant Spider |
| 2 | Cave - You have stumbled into part of a natural cave system, which has been built over as the city grew. The tunnels and rooms are unworked and there are places where you have to squeeze through narrow gaps to move forward. | 1 - C20 Giant Spider, 2 - C25 Skeleton, 3-4 - C21 Troglodytes, 5 - C24 Grannits, 6 - C17 Ratman |
| 3 | Lair - this place has been excavated by some creature or group of creatures as its home. Looking at the huge claw marks on the walls, you can't help wondering if they are still about... | 1 - C21 Troglodytes, 2 - C24 Grannits, 3-4 - C9 Giant Rat, 5-6 - C20 Giant Spider |
| 4 | Sewer - This was once part of the sewerage system and for all you know, it might still be connected in places. A nasty miasma fills the air and the squeaking of rats can be heard in the darkness. The floor is a mixture of mud and slime - remember to clean your boots later. | 1 - C19 Ravenous Slime, 2 - C20 Giant Spider, 3-4 - C9 Giant Rat, 5-6 - C17 Ratman |
| 5 | Dungeon - these rooms and corridors were constructed as part of a larger building, almost certainly for the purpose of imprisoning people. The rooms are small and rough with the rusted remains of chains decorating the walls. | 1 - C8 Ghoul, 2 - C25 Skeleton, 3 - C9 Giant Rat, 4 - C26 Orc Raider, 5-6 - C10 Goblin Infiltrator |
| 6 | Crypt - this was once a religious place used to house the remains of the dead. Tomb raiders have visited and the once carefully organised tombs have been broken into and pillaged. As you step forward you can feel bones crunching underfoot. | 1 - C9 Giant Rat, 2 - C20 Giant Spider, 3-4 - C8 Ghoul, 5-6 - C25 Skeleton |

*For a more extensive variety of monsters, use the encounter tables in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy core rulebook or bestiaries such as Out of the Pit or Return to the Pit, or refer to the appropriate dungeon level encounters from Chapter 5 'Dungeon Creation & Encounters'.

## Table 4.1.26 Catacomb Condition.

| 1d6 | Condition |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | Crumbling - this place is falling apart! Bits of stone and masonry are peeling off the walls and ceilings and your stomping around is only making things worse. Every round of combat you must roll a 1d6. On a result of one, a piece of the ceiling has dislodged and is falling on you. You must make a test against SKILL with a +2 bonus or suffer one point of STAMINA damage. |
| 2 | Slimy - Moisture hangs heavy in the air, condensation dripping from the walls and ceiling and leaving fetid pools filled with foul smelling slime on every floor. Each time you are struck in combat you must make a SKILL roll with a +2 bonus or slip on the muck and find yourself prone (-4 to combat until you spend a round getting up). |
| 3 | Unholy - at some point this place was the site of a temple of evil and traces of that time linger on. If you use magic to heal yourself you will heal one less point of stamina than normal. |
| 4 | Infernal - strange heat courses through the floor and walls in this area and pools of bubbling hot water have to be stepped around carefully. If you are in combat, roll a 2d6 each round - on a roll of a 2 a blast of steam has vented from a nearby crack in the masonry and you suffer 2 points of STAMINA damage. On the good side, once you have dealt with the encounters in this area you can bathe in a warm pool. |
| 5 | Well lit - Most Catacombs are near pitch black dark, but in this case a strange fungus covers the walls and ceilings, giving off a weird purple glow. You don't need torches here but Sneak skill has a -1 penalty. |
| 6 | Consecrated - This area is located at a site that was once a temple of a benevolent god. If you use any healing magic in here, you gain an additional +1 STAMINA points in recovery. |

## Table 4.1.27 Creature Conditions.

| 1d6 | Creature Modifiers |
|-----|-------------------|
| 1 | Well-fed - The creatures of this place have been particularly well supplied with food recently - some unlucky adventurers perhaps - and you must add +1 STAMINA to each creature you encounter |
| 2 | Noisy - Creatures here are particularly noisy and unsubtle - you may add +1 to your Awareness Special Skill rolls whilst in this dungeon. |
| 3 | Starving - The creatures of this area are running low on supplies and are starving. You may reduce the STAMINA of every creature by 1 point. |
| 4 | Plagued - a foul stench fills the air down here and you cough and splutter on bitter spores that seem to fill the air. The creatures you encounter are plagued and after any combat you must roll 1d6. On a roll of 1 you can have been infected - roll on table 4.3.2 'Diseases'. |
| 5 | Infested - The sound of scuttling claws is nearly constant here. Any encounter in this area comes with an additional Grannit - which you have to deal with. |
| 6 | Riches - The monsters of this place have had particularly good luck with their raiding and delving. Every creature you defeat has an additional 1d6 pieces of gold in its hoard. |

## Table 4.1.28 Catacomb Encounters. For more variety, refer to the tables and advice given in Chapter 5.

| 1d6 | Roll once as you enter each room. |
|-----|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | This area is empty - you investigate carefully, but there is neither treasure, trap nor monster to be found. The quiet here is unsettling and you have no desire to stay longer. |
| 2 | Trapped - roll on the Devious Trap (M16) - to move through this area. There are no monsters here. |
| 3-4 | Monster - roll on the table above to see what is lurking down here in the darkness |
| 5 | Monster + Trap - roll on the table to see what you meet and in addition you must roll on the Devious Trap (M16). You must deal with the trap before you proceed to the fight. |
| 6 | Monster and Treasure - in addition to meeting something you need to fight, you have found a hoard of treasure - you must defeat the encounter before you get to loot the hoard (see the Forgotten Stash Map encounter M21). |

## Example

Skurl Glintscale has found a catacombs entrance in one of the 'streets' locations in Ludria. In this case part of a house has collapsed, revealing a narrow entrance into a chamber that lies below street level. Deciding that we don't want to create a complete dungeon, we use the abbreviated rules to make a few rooms to explore.

Firstly we roll to see how big the catacomb is - a roll of 3 means we have 6 rooms to explore. Next we roll for its origin and another 3 tells us that this is a lair - excavated by some animal, though they may not live here anymore.

Next we roll to see what condition our lair is in. A 5 indicates that it is well lit, with a luminous fungus providing sufficient light that a torch is not needed. The next step is to check the creature's condition and a roll of 4 means they are 'plagued', which means we will have to check for disease after each fight. Yuck.

With that done we can proceed to explore room by room.

Each time we roll on the Catacomb Encounters table to see what we are faced with - an empty room, a trap, or a monster. Skurl can explore the whole catacomb or retreat after dealing with a few rooms. If he does clear every room he can make a test of his Underground Lore skill to try and find a further 1d6 rooms to explore.

Whatever we decide to do, we should make a note of where the entrance is but bear in mind that it will only exist for 1d6+3 days.

## Special Rules

**Catacombs do not have a separate encounter table.** The encounters will be inside, should you venture there. In addition, The Watch never enters the Catacombs, so no encounters here will require you to roll on the Lawbreaker table.

**The general citizenry do not like leaving open an entrance to a dangerous underground world near to their house or business.** A Catacombs entrance should be marked on your map, but should be removed after 1d6+3 days - at some point the locals get together and board it up or fill it in with rubble. Make this roll when you find the entrance and make a note of when to remove it.
