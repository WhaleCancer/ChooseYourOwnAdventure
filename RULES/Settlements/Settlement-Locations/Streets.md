# Streets

A row of houses either side of a paved way presents itself to you. Looking along you can see a variety of dwellings; Mostly timber frame houses with second stories that hang out over the street and threaten to crash into each other - in places you could pass something from hand to hand through the upper windows. There are some stone buildings too and occasionally a small herb garden or pigsty breaks up the line and you can see that at the back of the row there are narrow alleyways weaving between gardens, outhouses and other smaller constructions.

The streets consist of a partially cobbled track with mud and plank walkways either side of it. People, riders and carts jostle to make their way along it, whilst avoiding the worst of the muck and nightsoil that inevitably builds up at the edges. The smells of fires and cooking come from a variety of sources and the sounds of busy everyday life are all around you.

The Streets are not just the place to find the houses of the common people - here you will find workshops, small warehouses and other buildings needed for everyday life.
