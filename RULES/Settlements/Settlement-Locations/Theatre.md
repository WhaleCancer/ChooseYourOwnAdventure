# Theatre

'Come Ladies and Gentleman, Gentlemen and Ladies, come hither and see the delights - acrobat's that spin and leap, bards with voices sweet as nightingales, mummers with stories old and new - all this and more await you!' The gleeman, dressed in a patchwerk of coloured cloth, jesters boots of green leather ringed with tiny brass bells and a tall floppy hat decorated with a multitude of feathers and fake gemstones, leads you onwards to a large brightly painted building. Festooned with gaily coloured statues and dyed cloth banners that flap in the breeze, signs proclaim (in several languages) the opportunity to enjoy the delights of the theatre all for the price of a few coppers. The Theatre stands several storeys high, broad wooden steps lead up to several wide doorways which are flanked by ticket booths guarded by hulking sour-faced bouncers that deter those who try to slip in without payment. From each floor light streams out of coloured glass in the shape of the masks of tragedy, comedy, glory, disaster and all the other touchpoints of drama. A crowd mills around at the entrance and in the street ticket-sellers move amongst them, drumming up an audience of the next performance.

Around and about the Theatre there are other smaller venues and entertainments as this area is rich with nightlife, though there are also houses both rich and poor. This is one of the most varied locations in the settlement.

## Special Rules

**You may indeed visit the Theatre, which is ready to take your coin both day and night.** For 2sp you can spend a few hours enjoying a number of acts - singers, dancers, acrobats, comedians and so on make their way across the stage. Drinks and food can be bought here too, Ale (or similar) for 3sp and a hot meal for 2gp. For a more refined performance you can watch a play (1gp) or even spend a night at the opera (5gp and you are expected to be clean and well dressed).

**If your city is particularly barbaric or cruel, you might want to replace the theatre location with an arena for gladiatorial combat.** If your city is not the sort of place that would have a permanent theatre, you can leave this location as an open area such as a square, plaza or park that could be used as a place to hold circuses or events.
