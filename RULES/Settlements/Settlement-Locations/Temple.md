# Temple

A large heavily decorated building catches your eye. Stone steps lead from the street up to a set of wooden double doors which are open and there are people coming in and out. Looking more closely you see that there are religious symbols marked on the walls and you guess that it is a temple of some kind. Given the number and variety of gods on Titan, it is not clear if this temple is dedicated to one particular power, or several of them as is often the case. It is not unusual to find a temple to Usrel that also has a small chapel dedicated to Libra or a garden reserved for followers of Glantanka. It looks as if the temple is unguarded and welcoming to strangers, If you want to you can enter and investigate further. Whilst the temple is the most interesting building in this area, it is also surrounded by houses, accommodation for priests and novices, and places for pilgrims and visiting worshippers to eat and stay.

Chapter 7, 'Political Systems & Religions' covers the generation of a random morality and religion for each settlement or region. If you have not decided which god or gods are worshipped in this settlement, use Table 7.1.2 'Religious Inclination of the Settlement or Region' and Table 7.1.3 'List of the Gods' to determine what the religion and gods are, or you can simply assign it as a temple of 'good', 'neutral' or 'evil' as fits your campaign.

If your Character is a priest of the same religion as the temple, they should automatically succeed in the Religion Lore rolls needed to use the services here, though they will be refused aid if they go to a temple that is of a different alignment (priests dedicated to the gods of good will not be helped at neutral or evil temples and so on).

If you have chosen an alignment for your Character - Good, Neutral, Evil they should automatically succeed in the Religion Lore rolls needed to use the services when they visit a temple that has the same alignment, but also be refused these services at temples of different alignment.

## Special Rules

**You may ask for healing here, though the priests are not always available.** Make a 5gp donation and make a Religion Lore roll with a +3 bonus. If you succeed, a priest heals you for 3 points of STAMINA, you may only do this once per day.

**If afflicted by disease, you may try and find a priest to heal you here.** Pay a 10gp donation and then make a Religion Lore roll with a +3 bonus. If you succeed, a priest takes pity on you and cures your disease. If you fail, they accept the donation and promise to pray for you.

**You may find a place to pray at the Temple.** Make a Religion Lore roll with a +3 bonus to find a suitable spot. If you succeed, you can spend some time in worship - roll 1d6. If you roll a 5, restore on point of STAMINA, if you roll a 6 the gods smile on you and restore one point of LUCK. You may only receive this benefit once per week.

**If your Character wants to learn the Priestly Magic, they can do so at a temple.** In addition to spending the experience points, the Character will need to attend the temple every day for a week, spending the entire day praying (this will effectively stop them from carrying out missions at this time) and they will need to purchase 5gp worth of incense each day, to burn whilst they beseech their god to grant them powers. At the end of this period of worship the Character can spend their experience points to raise their Priestly Magic skill from zero to one.
