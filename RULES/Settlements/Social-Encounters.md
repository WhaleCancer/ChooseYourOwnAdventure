# Settlement Social Encounters

In this section are the 'social encounters', so called because it is usually possible to avoid combat and success is achieved by using social skills - Etiquette,
Con, Bargain, Leadership and a few others.
Each person you meet has a 'Social Rank'. For more details on social rank and how it is used, see section 7.2 'Social Status & Rank'. The important point to remember is that the difference in social rank acts as a modifier to skill tests for Etiquette, Con, Bargain or
Leadership rolls. If your Character has a social rank of 5 and they are talking to a Leper with social rank 2, they have a +3 bonus to their skill tests. If however they are talking to a Young Noble who has social rank 7, they have a -2 penalty. Characters start their adventures with a social rank of 3. Progress is made by completing adventures.
Characters should also consider how long it takes to complete an encounter - if you are in hot pursuit of a villain, you may not have time to spend half an hour to an hour chatting with a washerwoman.
Temporary skill bonuses and penalties: Many of the encounters give you an opportunity to gain a bonus to a future skill use, though often at the risk of suffering a penalty. Such bonuses and penalties last until you use them (usually by making a skill test) or leave that settlement for a day or more. Remember that if you want to retire to an inn or drinking den to
'wait it out', you have to pay the cost of food and lodging.
Call for Aid!
From time to time Characters might come across people they can convince to join their cause. This will be described in the text as 'So-and-so says you may call upon their aid'. The Character may ask this person to fight alongside them, usually for one encounter only (as described in the text). The Character will have to make the combat rolls for them according to the standard rules and they will mimic the Character - if the Character flees, they flee too.
Important note: This feature is intended to provide some assistance to the Characters, not allow them to build up an army of followers! You should only have one of each type of person available to help you - so if you have already met a peasant today and persuaded them to help you, no more will be persuaded to help you until you have used their services.
