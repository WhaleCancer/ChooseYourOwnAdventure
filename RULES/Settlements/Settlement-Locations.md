*For a town or village, if these locations are available, they should be more specific than in a city. A College in a city will
teach many disciplines. A College in a town will be smaller and focused on one thing - maybe Plant Lore for a town surrounded by fields, or Sea Lore for a town near the ocean. A jail in a Town will be there for a specific purpose - maybe they have a problem with bandits that need to be held before transporting, or the town is used as a holding place for convicted felons on their way to hard labour in the mines.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 53
As an example to show what you can quickly create we have included here a map of the port city of
Ludria, generated using this method. You can see that the map is not particularly detailed at this point - it's important to understand that you can start your adventures using a fairly simple map and add more detail later as you see fit. Your initial map doesn't need to include specific streets and buildings. On the map we haven't put in streets or place names to start with just simple shapes to show where districts start and end. These are marked up with the abbreviations shown in the Table 4.1.5 List of Settlement Locations, so 'CG2' is City Gate 2 and 'MP1' is market place 1.
Ludria is not intended to be part of any specific place within Titan, it is a generic fantasy city which shows you how these rules can be applied. You can of course use it in your campaigns should you wish to.
For Ludria we have used the map encounters to discover some features of each location and given an example of how you may want to record these details
- see 'Section 4.5 Settlement Details Sheet'. Exactly
how much you want to write down is up to you, it will probably depend on how often you want to return to a particular settlement.

Finishing Off
When you have created your map, you should feel free to customise it as you see fit. If, for example, you have ended up with the garbage heap next to some wealthy streets, you could swap some locations around until you have a map that you are happy with or add additional locations. If you want your city to be a renowned home for scholars, you could use the dice drop method to add another college or two. If you want it to be a highly religious city, add more temples. You should keep tinkering with the map until you have a settlement that you feel happy with and remember to feel free to leave some parts of your map blank in case you wish to add more locations at a later date.
What about individual Streets?
In this book we have taken the approach of dividing settlements into locations, which are essentially the important buildings, districts or landmarks of that city, town or village. This creates a workable map with a variety of settings for your adventures - each location has its own character. We have not provided details of individual street layouts. Even a small city could have several hundred streets and this level of detail is not required to run or play games. For most interactions, the exact shape of the street is not relevant, though of course you may wish to create some maps of streets that you use regularly, or to have some battle maps to hand.
What does ma8er is what is going on in the streets, alleys, avenues and boulevards of your settlement - this is covered by the encounters tables for each location and by the guidance on street fighting given at the end of this section.
Encounters in a Settlement
Having created a working map, it is now time to venture into the city and start to meet its people. As you enter each location you should look it up in the
'Locations' section, to discover what you are going to meet there. For each type of location is given a description, any special rules and an encounter table that provides a broad selection of people and incidents that your Characteres can interact with. You should make a roll on the table when you enter a new location or when you spend a long time- several hours at least - in one place.
The encounters are described in sections 4.2 'Settlement Social Encounters',

## 'Settlement

Challenge Encounters' and 4.4 'Settlement Map Encounters'.
These encounters do not represent all the things that you see and meet; there will be peasants going about their work, small shops and workshops, traders moving goods about and the general hustle and bustle of a busy settlement. The encounters are simply the most interesting or relevant things you come across.
If you are using this book as a resource to help run adventures you can of course ignore the encounter tables and put in whatever people or places you would like to see. As usual, the Game Master should have final say.

Chapter 4 - Settlements 55 Types of encounter
Encounters are all divided into three broad categories: Social, Challenge or Map.
• Social encounters - See section '4.2 Settlement
Social Encounters': Although combat may be an option, these encounters are primarily based on using your social skills (Etiquette, Leadership,
Bargain, Con) but other rolls may be involved.
One important aspect of social encounters is that the people you meet have a Social Rank which can affect the skill rolls you make as part of the encounter. In the encounter tables they are marked with an 'S', so the 'Soldier' encounter is S44.
• Challenge encounters - See section '4.3
Settlement Challenge Encounters': Often combat based but may also involve using some of your other Skills in order to survive. You might need to leap across a chasm or avoid some other type of danger. You do not, generally, make social skill tests in these encounters.  In the encounter tables they are marked with an 'C', so the 'Ghoul' encounter is C8.
• Map encounters - See section '4.4 Settlement
Map Encounters': These encounters add some additional detail about your location and allow you to build up a complicated city with numerous features, adding places you can interact with such as a Weaponsmith or Stables. You should make a note of these as you find them in case you wish to return there later on.  In the encounter tables they are marked with an 'M', so the 'Armourer' encounter is M13.
Number of Encounters each day
The number of encounters you have each day is difficult to gauge; too many and you can be overwhelmed by simply moving around the settlement, too few and it feels empty and boring.
It is suggested that you make a maximum of three encounter rolls per day for any single location - one for the morning, one for the afternoon and one for the night. This will keep your settlement busy but not be overwhelming.
The encounter tables for each location are different and are designed to represent the type of people and problems you might run into - the area around a temple should have a different feel to it than the garbage heap.
Most of the encounters do not have a set duration and it will be largely up to you, the Character, to decide how long they take and therefore how many encounters you can have during a day. Some will be longer than others; saving a burning building could take several hours, chatting to a peasant might only take minutes.
However, it is worth bearing in mind that the actual encounters are merely highlights of your day. You are also finding your way around a teeming city, trying to investigate strange goings on, stopping to rest and eat from time to time and generally having to cope with all that life throws at you.
Avoiding Encounters
Sometimes, you might want to avoid encounters, either because you are injured or perhaps you just want to move quickly about the city. You can do this by making a test against either the Sneaking or City
Lore Skills. If you are Sneaking, you are trying to slip past the crowds without a8racting a8ention. If you use City Lore, you are trying to remember a shortcut or quiet back alley that can take you through.

If you have to stay in a specific location for some time
(a mission requires you to watch a location for a number of hours for example) the skill test should be made with a -3 penalty as it is difficult to go unnoticed for this long.
If you succeed with your test you can ignore one of the encounters you roll for this location. You must decide if you are going to do this before you roll on the encounter table.
Increasing Encounters
It may be that you want to have additional encounters at a specific location, maybe as part of a mission or quest. In that case you may make a skill test against one of Etiquette (asking around),
Awareness or City Lore (searching). Looking for encounters means spending some time at a location, possibly just standing around waiting for something to happen. As a rule of thumb you can try this twice during the day (once for the morning, once for the afternoon) and once at night, when settlements are generally quieter.
Optional Rule: The 'Quiet City'
The encounter system is designed to give your settlements a lively, bustling feel - places where you are having to shoulder your way through the crowd just to make headway and you never know what may be around the next corner. However, some people might prefer to move around more freely, so the 'Quiet City' option can be used. If your Character is simply travelling through a location en route to somewhere else, roll encounters but ignore 'social' and 'challenge' encounters. Keep making a note of
'map' encounters as this helps build up your city for future use.
Example: Initiate Zadi Kellist is in Ludria and has spent the night in 'The Thresher' (TA2 on the map) and now wants to move over to the 'Paupers Pit' as part of her current quest.
Looking at the map of Ludria she decides on a route she will take - through WS2 (The Silver Streets) to the docks, DO, then take the ferry across to ST3 (The Hill) and then into
GY2. Zadi is not trying to avoid encounters so we make a roll to see what she meets in each location. In WS2 a roll on the Wealthy Streets is a 7 so she meets a Toady (S7) and discovers a map encounter which turns out to be a
Bathhouse (M27). She ignores the Toady and carries onto the Docks, where (with a roll of 11 on the table) she meets a Group of Traders (S5).
Zadi decides to spend some time talking to them, buying a round of drinks and in return ge3ing some useful information. She takes the ferry (1gp fee) over to ST3, a
Streets location but decides to try and avoid an encounter by making a test of her City Lore skill. She rolls a 7 which would usually be a failure, but the +2 bonus she received from talking to the Group of Traders means she succeeds, so she slips unnoticed through this location. Arriving at the Graveyard she rolls a 15 and meets the Funeral Cortege
(C4) encounter! This could be a tough fight for our initiate, but hopefully she makes it through.
As you can see, this approach to moving around the city makes it a lively and occasionally dangerous place. If this is too much for you, consider using the
'quiet city' optional rule to speed things up.
Nigh=ime and Resting
As night falls, most people will return to their homes and lock up for the night. Torches and candles cost money and there is no street lighting on Titan! Once you have completed what you feel to be enough encounters for one day, you will need to find a place to bed down and sleep. You can do this at an inn, tavern or drinking den - see the prices listed for those locations - or you can sleep rough, by trying to find an

Chapter 4 - Settlements 57 abandoned shack or quiet nook to rest in. Clearly, sleeping outdoors in a teeming city has its own risks that you should be aware of. If you choose to take the risk, choose odds or evens then roll a 1d6 - if you correctly predict the outcome of the roll, your judgement about where to sleep was good and you get a full night's rest. If you are wrong, your sleep has been disturbed and you must roll for an encounter. If this encounter is dangerous, your opponents receive
+4 to their combat rolls and +2 to their damage rolls on the first round as you awake from your slumber.

What is outside my settlement?
For a town or village, when you leave the area of your map you should use the rules for wilderness travel - the area just outside of a settlement is likely to be farmed land, but could be any type of environment appropriate to the land you are adventuring in.
For a city, the area immediately outside the city should be treated as either Slum Alleys (1-5 on 1d6) or Garbage Heap (6 on 1d6) locations. This is because many of the poorer people, unable to afford lodgings within the city, will build dwellings close to the city wall in the hope that they can flee inside when troubles come - which they always do. You should break this area into a reasonable number of separate parts, based on the size of your city (this prevents
Characteres from taking a shortcut outside the city by going out of one gate, around and back in another gate).  Further beyond this shanty town will be farmland or wilderness - use the rules provided in the wilderness section.
Finding a random location in your settlement
Many of the missions require you to pick a location in your city at random. There are two methods for doing this. The usual method is to drop or roll a dice onto your map and see where it ends up - if it goes off the map, roll it again. The location you want is the one under the dice, if it se8les on a boundary line then use your judgement to decide where you are going.
The second method is to use the 'Random Location' numbers on the locations table - roll a 1d6 twice and refer to the numbers in that column - a roll of 3 followed by a 2 would be the Hospital. A roll of 5 followed by a 4 would need to be rerolled as there is no 5.4 on the list. For locations with more than one appearance (inn's for example) either roll again or use your judgement to decide which one is most appropriate.
Location Descriptions/Encounter Tables
For each of the different locations within a settlement, a brief description is given including any special rules that relate to that type of place and the random encounter tables are provided to bring it to life.

Settlement Specific Rules
There are some things that apply to adventuring within a settlement but not to dungeons or the wilds, mostly down to interactions with 'the Watch' or whatever local law enforcement exists in the city, town or village. These rules are intended to cover those interactions.
Fighting in the Streets
Some encounters and missions require you to fight in the streets (or taverns) of Titan; you might be wondering how the 'street environment' affects these combats. As an optional rule, you can roll on the following table to see if there are any other factors to consider.

## Table 4.1.29 Street Factors

2d6 Factor 2
The Watch appear and they are not happy with this fighting. They swarm you and your opponent,

dragging you apart and stopping the fight. Make a test of your Law skill - if you succeed they let you go after ten minutes interrogation, if you fail they drag you to the Jail location where you must spend the

night, though you get all your gear back in the morning.
3
The mob turns on you - other people nearby decide you are a troublemaker and pelt you with

improvised weapons. You have to fight with -1 to all skill tests as you dodge the barrage of muck.
4
Mud & Muck - the street is slippery with mud from a recent storm or rotting food and waste (you don't

have time to check which) - any tests of Acrobatics, Running, Climbing or Jumping have a -2 penalty here as you slip and slide.
5
Small - the street is small and cramped, you cannot use a missile weapon here and Sneaking is at -3.
6
As combat begins, someone throws a bucket of nightsoil from a window above you; test your Dodge skill or get hit. If you do get covered with indescribable muck you have -3 to your combat rolls for the first

two rounds as you cough and splu8er. Later on, you may want to take a bath.
7
The streets are quiet..the fight proceeds as normal and without interruption.
8
A group of drinkers stumble out of a nearby establishment and watch with interest. If you make a test of your Leadership skill some will come and help you, giving you +1 to your Combat skill rolls.
9
Unusual Layout - this street has an odd shape, you can use it to your advantage getting +3 once to one skill roll from Sneaking,
Awareness or combat. If you use a ranged weapon you can shoot twice before your foe reaches you.
10
The crowd goes wild! Other people on the streets see you are in trouble and decide to help, pelting your opponent with items such as cabbages, bricks etc. Each round they dish out one point of damage to your foe.
11
You spot some rickety crates in a perfect location; you can hide behind them (+3
Sneaking) or you can climb on them to gain +2 to your combat roll by having the higher ground, but if you fumble an attack  the crates break and you fall to the floor, leaving you prone for one round.
12
A passing adventurer pitches in to help you.
She has SKILL 8 STAMINA 12 Weapon: Mace
Armour: Shield and Chain Hauberk - she fights alongside you until this combat is over, then hurries off to pursue her own quests.
