# Creating your Wilderness

In this section we show you how to create a varied, playable map of the wilds using a variety of methods and options.

## Finding your Way & Mapping

For the sake of building a map we divide the world into areas, each 10 miles across, which is a distance that can be covered in half a day's travel on a well made road. Usually when making maps of this kind, hexagonal or 'hex' patterns are used, but square patterns or any regular tile or grid can be used, depending on what you have available.

Each area on the map is assigned a type of environment, representing the dominant features you find as you traverse it. Thus an area designated 'Plains' will be mostly flat or gently rolling grasslands, but it will still have small hills, ponds and maybe a river or two - very few areas will consist purely of one type of environment. It's up to your Character to use their skills to get across it via the shortest and safest path.

Unless your campaign specifies that a road or track exists you should assume that your Character is working their way through as best they can - their speed will vary depending on how well they read the land.

Travelling through untracked wilderness is very much slower than using a road or path!

## Map Creation

There are a number of ways in which you can create a map of the wilderness; pick the one that best suits you, remembering that the rules of this book divide the wilderness into areas that are about ten miles across.

**Create a map:** Either on paper or a computer, this simple and popular method requires only your time and imagination. Draw a map of your landscape putting in whichever features you require and then working out a scale - you can then divide it into hexes or squares of around 10 miles in size.

**Borrow a map:** With the popularity of role playing games on the rise there are a huge number of maps available online, many for free. Choose one that you like and download or print it off - you can mark in the different areas as you go.

**Use the 'Dice Drop' method:** Described in the core Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebook as a means of creating a dungeon, the dice drop method can be used also for wilderness maps by creating a random pattern which you then fill in using your imagination or by rolling 2d6 on the table below. A piece of paper, pencil and some dice are all that is required. Very useful when you are struggling for inspiration!

**Use a 'narrative' map:** For long journeys overland, you might want to use a narrative or story based map in which you decide how long your journey takes and what sort of terrain you cross; treating it as an abstract story in which your Character spends some time in the wilderness. For example you could decide that to get to their destination they will need to spend ten days in the forest and three days in the mountains before arriving - obviously, you still need to keep a rough map in your mind as to where things are if you take this approach.

## Completely Random Landscape Generation

Landscapes can be created through purely random generation, starting with a marked piece of paper and some dice. This technique works best with hexagonal or square lined paper.

Firstly, pick a hex (or square) as your starting point and decide what sort of environment you would like to start in. If you are starting in a settlement, think about what would be around it. A dwarven citadel might be surrounded by mountains whereas a human city could be on plains or a shoreline. From this area, starting with the north most edge, work your way around clockwise making a roll to see what sort of environment is adjacent to that edge. This will fill out the map around you.

Repeat this process for as long as you wish to, depending on how far you need to travel. Remember that this is your map and you can apply some common sense, if you feel that the random generation does not make sense, though it is sometimes fun to take up the challenge of interpreting the results - a single mountain in the middle of a jungle could be home to a lost temple or hidden lair!

**Hot and Cold climates:** If you wish to set your map in an area with a hot climate, replace any Tundra & Ice areas with Desert and similarly, if you want your map to be in a cold area, replace any Desert areas with Tundra & Ice.

| Region | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|
| Plains | Tu | De | Ri | Hi | Pl | Pl | Fo | Ma | Ju | Sh | Mo |
| Forest | De | Mo | Ma | Hi | Fo | Fo | Pl | Ju | Ri | Sh | Tu |
| Hills | Ma | Tu | De | Pl | Hi | Hi | Mo | Fo | Ri | Ju | Sh |

| Jungle | Tu | Mo | Hi | Ma | Ju | Ju | Fo | Ri | Pl | Sh | De |
| Marsh & Swamp | De | Pl | Fo | Ju | Ma | Ma | Ri | Sh | Hi | Mo | Tu |

### Table 6.1.2 Random Wilderness Area Finder

The area you are looking for lies 3+1d6 areas away in the following direction. Roll 1d6 three times.

Roll 1d6 (Reroll 5 or 6) to find a column, then roll 1d6 (Reroll 5 or 6) to find a direction.

| Roll 1d6 (Column) | 1-2 | 3-4 |
|-------------------|-----|-----|
| 1 | North | North East |
| 2 | East | South East |
| 3 | South | South West |
| 4 | West | North West |

For example: If you roll a 2, followed by a 4 then a 3, the random wilderness area lies 5 areas away (50 miles) in the South West direction. A roll of 4, 2 and 2 would mean it lies 7 areas away (70 miles) to the East.

## Permanent Features

As you travel the wilderness, you may come across things which are permanent - settlements, dungeon entrances, campsites. This is noted in the encounter description. You should note these on your map as you create it, in general you can find (or avoid) them in the future by passing a Region Lore test.

## Example Map

In order to help you visualise how these maps can be put together (and it's entirely your decision as to how you want to map out your world) we have included an example map, showing the region around Ludria.

It has a wide variety of environments to explore and one other settlement (King's Gap), but no other details have been added in case you want to use the map yourself. As with all maps of this type each area has been marked with the dominant type of environment, but they are all mixed to some extent, so as the river leads north from Ludria those areas are marked as 'Ri' meaning Rivers & Lakes, but of course there are also fields, small hills and glades of trees dotted around. As well as being marked 'Ri', 'Pl' etc each area has a little symbol to indicate what sort of environment is present.
