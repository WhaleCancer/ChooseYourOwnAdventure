# Unusual Settlements

This book covers the standard types of settlement in which humans are the dominant race, but there are of course many other places where you might find large groups of people. Here are some suggestions and ideas on how you might modify the rules to be more fitting.

## Citadel or Fortress

A heavily guarded settlement with a strong military presence. Remove locations that are unlikely to be present (theatre, slum alley, college) and increase the number of 'militaristic' locations such as Keep, Jail. For random encounters consider replacing social encounters Wedding Party or Mummers with encounters like Soldier or Surly Watchmen. Any trouble is likely to result in a roll on table 4.1.30 'Lawbreaker' and there might be a curfew that prevents moving around at night.

## Dwarven Settlement

When creating your map, remember that the bulk of the settlement is probably underground! You may want to create two maps, one for the 'minehead' part that is above ground, where dwarves and other races mix and do business, and another map for underground settlement where the dwarves reside. As they are serious and orderly people, dangerous encounters will be far less likely underground and slums probably non-existent (though of course it could be a settlement that has fallen on hard times, which is why the Characters are visiting in the first place). Most social encounters will be with dwarves, not humans. It might be that only dwarves are allowed in some parts of the settlement (or at least permission must be obtained from the authorities to move around) and temples will be dedicated to the gods revered by the dwarves, such as Throff and Verlang.

## Elven Settlement

Elven settlements are likely to be surrounded by and blended with the natural world, so your initial map should reflect that. They might be spread out in a great forest or clustered about a magnificent waterfall, but they should have some deep connection with nature. There might be an area set aside for non-elvish visitors and some locations (slum alleys, garbage heap) are not in line with elvish culture, as they would not tolerate the existence of poverty, filth or crime in their settlements. Any act of criminality or violence (unless absolutely required) is likely to result in permanent expulsion. Temples (most likely natural sites such as a great tree or tranquil pool) will be dedicated to gods revered by the elves such as Galana.

## Ghost Town

A settlement that has, for some reason, been taken over by the undead! The simplest way to do this is to work out encounters as normal but replace all the living with skeletons, zombies, ghouls and so on. Obviously, there should be some reason for the Character to come to such a terrible place. There could be enclaves of living people still clinging on in some parts of the settlement giving your Characters a place to rest and trade, but the majority of the city would be overrun by the undead. Travelling around such a place should be extremely dangerous, particularly at night. Working out who is in charge of such a place and why it was created is an adventure in itself.

## Goblin / Orc Settlement

It might be unusual for the Characters to find themselves in a town or city dominated by orcs, goblins and other evil humanoids but not impossible. They could be in disguise, sneaking or magically altered to appear as one of these races, or they may need to risk going in to further their own quest. Whatever the reason, being in such a city should be incredibly dangerous and difficult, with violence being a near constant hazard and few places of refuge. Temples will be dedicated to the evil gods and encounters with the 'Watch' would mean a fight with a squad of orc militia - not pleasant!
