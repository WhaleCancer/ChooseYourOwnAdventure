# Unusual Dungeons

A dungeon is traditionally an underground complex but really it can be any group of rooms or spaces that are connected together, so let your imagination run wild. The method of creating dungeons described in Chapter 5 includes tables for dungeon origin, condition and creature conditions. You can modify these and the encounter tables to include different factors to give the dungeon some extra challenges.

Examples of unusual 'dungeons' could include almost any type of structure that has a consistent set of rules.

## Airship

An airship, flying through the sky and being attacked by harpies. The ship could have several decks (levels) with rooms full of crew and monsters fighting each other, whilst it rocks dangerously from side to side. The map would be a series of decks and encounter tables should only include flying monsters and acrobatics skill checks might be needed to stay on your feet. Most importantly, don't fall off!

**Suggested game effects:** Each round roll 1d6 - on a roll of 1 the airship has lurched unexpectedly and you must test your Acrobatics skill or fall to the ground. If this happens near the edge of a deck you must test your LUCK or fall off! Encounters can be modified to only include monsters that could fly, though there could also be some non-flying crew. Setting fire to the airship should be possible though this is obviously a very dangerous thing to do.

## Other Planes

A dungeon structure (caves, lair and so on) but located on a different plane of existence. A visit to an elemental plane - a Character could be moving across islands of hot rock surrounded by lava. All the encounters would be heat loving creatures, environmental hazards and traps would be centred around fire damage and the Character would need to find a way back to their own plane of existence. The map could be a series of rocky islands in the lava.

**Suggested game effects:** Much like the other planes wilderness area the 'dungeon condition' and the encountered monsters should reflect the nature of the plane of existence, as should the layout, shape and contents of rooms. A dungeon set on the plane of air is unlikely to have heavy stone doors between the rooms!

## High Magic

A wizard has shrunk the Character down to miniature size and set her to climb up inside an oak tree, with escape only possible by reaching the top.

The map might be a spiral of rooms and the encounters should be with miniaturised creatures or normal sized (and therefore giant to the Character) insects and bugs.

**Suggested game effects:** How you modify the dungeon and creature conditions and the encounters and room contents will depend entirely on what sort of 'high magic' adventure you are playing. For example, the Characters could be transformed by an evil wizard into characters within a painting and have to battle their way out by moving from one picture to another in a gallery with each painting representing one room.

This is a lot of fun to play around with, but be warned that it requires careful thought and planning by the Game Master in order to work.

## Haunted House

Imagine a huge old mansion or castle that once entered, seals itself up trapping the Characters inside until they discover the way to escape.

The layout and features of such a building would be very similar to those of a normal house or castle but it would be haunted by restless spirits or terrifying ghosts - the aim is to survive the experience and escape before the haunted house claims you.

**Suggested game effects:** Dungeon conditions should include a chance to encounter a wandering ghost or spirit in any room (test vs SKILL or flee for 1d6 rounds), doors should open or close without warning, encounters should be with 'spooky' monsters - not always undead, but perhaps giant bats and spiders, werewolves, demons or other planar entities that might be attracted to a haunted house.

Each floor of the house would be a different dungeon section and the goal should be to find the means to escape (or destroy the curse that made the house haunted in the first place).
