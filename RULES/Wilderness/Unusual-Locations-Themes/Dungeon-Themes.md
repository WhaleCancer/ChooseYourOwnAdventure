# Dungeon Themes

As well as dreaming up some unusual structures we can also come up with themes for our dungeons.

Instead of coming across random monsters and features we choose the ones that are most suitable and make use of the bestiaries and monster lists we have available to find groups of similar monsters.

This requires a fair amount of additional effort as each room presents a new set of choices, but the reward is a dungeon which feels like a distinct place with its own character. Some examples of dungeon themes and the associated choices are as follows.

## Undead

Although they can be found anywhere crypts, dungeons and buried buildings or ruins - places where they can pass the endless centuries in peace - are common haunts of the undead. Dungeon conditions such as crumbling, unholy or chilled might be found, creature conditions such as plagued or armoured work well. Encounters should be with undead of different types and if they have been set here to guard something, the number of traps and secret doors should be increased to deter looters.

## Demons

Although they could be found anywhere, demons may be attracted to chaos wrought or magic wrought structures, indeed they may have been summoned to such places. Dungeon conditions such as unholy, infernal or magically fecund could be used and toxic or noisy creature conditions work well for demons. Encounters should be with different kinds of demons or creatures that would be willing to serve them and rooms should be unfurnished or filled with the remains of equipment that the demons have destroyed. Intelligent demons might set traps of a magical nature though in general they prefer to rely on their own abilities to deal with problems.
