# Unusual Wilderness Areas

Any novel areas of wilderness should have some character or nature that makes them different enough to the usual places to require different encounters, terrain or weather. If you feel that a part of your wilderness needs to be given a different character to show that it is a special place, make sure to include some game effects that demonstrate it.

## Volcano

A volcano or area of volcanic activity (replaces a mountain area), with lava and hot springs providing a constant hazard. Rare and valuable materials, such as obsidian, might be found here in abundance giving the Character a reason to visit, but the encounter tables (or weather) could include the chance of being caught in an eruption and monsters should be fire or heat related. Weather could include clouds of ash and terrain might involve sudden fast lava flows.

**Suggested game effects:** A roll of 6 on the weather table means 'eruption' in which Characters must test their Dodge skill (or LUCK) or be hit by falling rocks for 2d6 points of damage. Replace one of the encounters with 'lava flows' which cut off your path and force you to spend another day going around, and replace another encounter with 'toxic gas cloud' which requires you to test your Awareness skill or suffer 2d6 points of damage as you nearly choke to death on the deadly but invisible gas. No settlements, tracks or paths can be found in this area as they are constantly destroyed by eruptions.

## Polluted Zone

For some reason a large area of land has been polluted or burnt (could replace any area), with pools of slick oil and acid pits dotting the terrain.

Monsters should be those that could survive such an environment and hazards could include clouds of poisonous gas or acid rain. Weather might include clouds of smoke or poison gas and terrain encounters could include pools of acid.

**Suggested game effects:** A roll of 6 on the weather table means 'acid rain' which causes 1d6 points of damage unless you can (Region Lore skill test) find a place to shelter. Replace one of the encounters with 'acid pits' which require a Climb skill test to pass or suffer 1d6 points of damage, and replace another encounter with 'toxic gas cloud' which requires you to test your Awareness skill or suffer 2d6 points of damage as you nearly choke to death on the deadly but invisible gas.

## Dead Zone

A part of the wilderness has been struck by necromantic magic and withered (could replace any area). Weather would be altered to include clouds of choking dust, terrain would include rotten and dying plants and encounters could be replaced with undead versions of whatever turns up.

**Suggested game effects:** A roll of 6 on the weather table means 'rain of blood' which causes no damage but reduces all social skill tests by -2 unless you can (Region Lore skill test) find a place to shelter, lasting until you can clean it off. Replace all the monsters encountered with undead versions - so if you meet wolves they are zombie wolves and so on. Skeleton versions suffer reduced damage from piercing weapons (spears, bows etc), zombies are slow (you can run away) but determined, ghoul versions of monsters can paralyse. Friendly encounters are far less likely and they should be rerolled or ignored. No hunting or foraging possible and any food you are carrying spoils after 2 days in this necrotic environment. Any settlements in this area are filled with the dead.

## Area of Wild Magic or Chaos

In some places the effects of magic have warped the world to a terrible extent and strange and dangerous forms have emerged (could replace any area). Weather could include almost any effect, the terrain could change suddenly from one type to another (desert to tundra to mountains in a few miles) and encounters should be altered to include chaos beasts.

**Suggested game effects:** A roll of 6 on the weather table means 'a storm of magic' which causes whatever effect you like! Pick one of the weather effects from any environment or create your own - a Region Lore skill test can be made to find a place to shelter from it.

Monsters encountered can be replaced with 'chaos' versions by giving them mutations or additional abilities such as the ability to breathe fire or spit poison. Friendly encounters are far less likely and they should be rerolled or ignored. Hunting and foraging are possible but any food might be (1-2 on 1d6) toxic and cause 2 points of STAMINA damage when eaten.

Any settlements are probably abandoned due to the strange situation, or populated with people that serve chaos and are likely to be hostile or violent.

## Other Planes

Perhaps your Characters have wandered off the 'mortal' planes and onto the elemental planes or some part of hell! (could replace any area)

Encounters should be adjusted to reflect that, so on the Plane of Air you may only meet air elementals or flying creatures, weather would be strange and extreme (constant high winds) and features could be clouds or storms.

**Suggested game effects:** A roll of 6 on the weather table should mean an elemental storm which would be extremely violent if the Characters have no protection, causing 2d6 points of damage with no way to find shelter as the whole area convulses. Encountered monsters should reflect the nature of the environment. Friendly encounters are extremely unlikely and should be ignored or replaced with dangerous monsters, perhaps elemental versions of the usual kinds. Thus on the planes of fire encountering a wild beast such as a lion would be 'fire' lion that could inflict an extra point of fire damage when it hits. Settlements, paths and tracks are probably non-existent and hunting and foraging impossible due to the changed nature of the wildlife.

## Underwater

Staying on the mortal plane but going into the sea or a great lake (replaces Shorelines & Sea), it's always fun to take on an underwater adventure.

Of course your Characters may need some form of magical or special assistance to breathe underwater and move around with freedom. You should definitely think carefully about modifiers to combat or magical effects (does a fire bolt work underwater or not? It's up to you).

**Suggested game effects:** Weather effects can be changed to 'tides' or 'currents' - a strong current might risk sweeping you away or make combat difficult. You might allow the existence of caves or islands where the Characters could shelter from these effects.

Encountered monsters should, naturally, be creatures that can survive underwater and friendly encounters should be modified or ignored to reflect the environment (a merchant could be a friendly group of merfolk for example). Settlements could exist and paths and tracks could be replaced with known currents and hunting and foraging should be possible, though meat might have to be eaten raw due to the lack of fire.

## Lost World / Dino-Land

A lost world means a place that is lost in time and is populated by creatures from past ages such as cavemen or dinosaurs. It could be any type of environment though 'lush jungle' is a popular choice, sometimes overlooked by a smoking volcano.

**Suggested game effects:** Encounters (friendly or not) should be replaced with 'primitive' creatures such as cavemen or dinosaurs, settlements and people should be barbaric and savage, tracks and roads should be non-existent, hunting and foraging should be easier but might have a chance (1 in 6) of leading to an encounter with a hunting dinosaur such as a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and weather effects might include a chance that the volcano explodes showering the area with balls of lava!
