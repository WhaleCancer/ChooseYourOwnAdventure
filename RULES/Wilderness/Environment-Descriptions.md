# Environment Descriptions

Each type of environment will have their own challenges and inhabitants, the environment descriptions provide you with details on weather, navigation and encounters. Remember that each area is described by the landscape and vegetation that are dominant but none of them will be entirely uniform.

Plains will have small lakes and rivers, mountains will have valleys, deserts may have stone peaks and oasis. As usual take what is written as a base upon which you can create your own unique zones.

The encounters are described in section 6.3, for a list see [Wilderness Encounters](./RULES/Wilderness#Wilderness Encounters.md).
