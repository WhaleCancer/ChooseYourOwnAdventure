# W14: Monster!

What’s that coming over the hill? Yes, it’s a monster.

And it may not be coming over the hill, but might be swooping out of the sky, bursting from the ground or appearing out of thin air.

There are a number of ways you can find a monster to fight whilst on Titan. The most obvious is to use the encounter tables in one of the published bestiaries, ‘Out of the Pit’, ‘Return to the Pit’ and ‘Beyond the Pit’ which contain a variety of monsters divided by environment.

For the sake of variety it is recommended you use as many of the bestiaries as you have available, though note that the encounter tables are not divided by difficulty, so be prepared for a challenging fight and remember to read the monster description fully so that you understand what you are facing.

If you do not have them available you can use the Predator encounter (W13) to quickly find an opponent or you can create a completely random monster. The table below will allow you to generate an opponent, which might be easy to fight or extremely difficult as its characteristics are based on the SKILL (or MAGIC) and STAMINA of your hero.

Roll badly and you could be facing a very powerful creature indeed.

Table 6.3.2 Random Monster Generator. Roll Separately for each trait to build up a monster.

*Use the SKILL and STAMINA of the hero as the base number. For magic using heroes, use their MAGIC score instead of SKILL. So a hero with SKILL of 7 who rolls a 9 on 2d6 faces a creature with SKILL 6 (i.e. their SKILL minus one).
