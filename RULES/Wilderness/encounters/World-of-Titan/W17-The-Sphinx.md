# W17: The Sphinx

Coming around the edge of an outcropping of stone you are amazed to see the statue of a sphinx, carved from an enormous block of stone, its ancient weathered face staring solemnly across the landscape. As you look up at its worn features, a deep and somewhat menacing voice speaks directly into your mind. ‘You have found the sphinx, mortal, and now must choose. Will you answer my riddle or not?

A great reward is given for the right answer, but the wrong answer is..painful’.

You may ignore the offer and continue, or a8empt to solve the riddle. If you make the a8empt, choose five different Lore skills and make five separate skill tests.

For each success, pick a number between 1 and 6.

Once you have made your five rolls, roll 1d6. If the number rolled is one of those you picked, you have answered correctly and receive the Sphinx’s reward.

If you roll a number you didn’t choose, mocking laughter fills your mind and a blast of energy shoots from the eyes of the Sphinx causing 2d6 points of STAMINA damage!

The reward for success is a chest full of coins and jewels, worth 10d6 gold pieces, which appears at your feet with a flash of magic.

You may a8empt to answer the riddle of the Sphinx once each year, should you wish to return. Feature:

The Sphinx should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test.
