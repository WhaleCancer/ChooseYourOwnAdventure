# W7: Merchant

Rumbling along a narrow track that crosses the landscape before you comes a covered wagon pulled by a shaggy maned heavy horse, being led along by a middle-aged woman dressed in travelling clothes and well worn leather boots. Upon seeing you she pulls the horse to a halt, retrieves a crossbow from the front seat of the wagon and holds up a hand in greeting. With the crossbow held nonchalantly at her hip, pointing away from you, she seems to be not unfriendly but simply wary of a stranger on the road.

What do you do?

● You’ve no need to bargain for wares at this time.

You nod your head in greeting and move on.

● Bartering is a welcome distraction from trudging along in the wilds. You return her greeting and, being sure to keep your hands away from your weapons, approach and ask if she has anything to trade. She is mostly carrying skins and ores (neither of which has been refined) but she is willing to sell rations or any item of ‘general equipment’ for twice the usual village cost. She will buy up to 100gp worth of items, paying one quarter of their usual value (any items not on the general equipment list can be sold for 2d6sp or 3d6sp with a successful Bargain skill roll - she has Bargain skill 6).

● A merchant alone on the road? What a prize! You stifle a grin and move towards her, but she senses your intentions! Merchant SKILL 6 STAMINA 13 Weapons:

Crossbow, Short Sword.

Armour:

Chainmail Hauberk. As you move to a8ack she will fire her crossbow and leap onto the wagon, yelling a command to her horse which is well trained enough to charge forward. You may fight her for three rounds before the merchant escapes on her wagon. If you do defeat her, you can recover 4d6 meals and 4d6gp worth of trade goods. The ores and skins are of no use to you without her contacts. The horse and wagon are yours to do with as you will, but cannot be taken directly across untracked country.
