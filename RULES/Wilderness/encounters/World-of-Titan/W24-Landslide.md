# W24: Landslide

Your only warning of impending disaster is a brief flurry of loose stones and dirt trickling past you down the slope. As you look around for the source of this activity, fearing an ambush, there is an awful cracking, grinding noise as the earth about you starts to move. You have been caught in a landslide!

You must try to dive free anyway you can. Make a test against your Dodge, Acrobatics or Climb skill (pick one only) to see if you can move clear of the danger area in time.

If you succeed you tumble out of the way just in time and sit, counting your blessings, as a large volume of rocks and dirt rumble by. If you fail the test you are caught up in the chaos and bashed around. Take 2d6 points of damage (cannot be dodged or avoided with armour) as you are smashed about and half buried.

Eventually the landslide comes to a stop and, if you have survived, you are able to dig yourself out and carry on.

If you have a mount with you, it must also suffer your fate - if you dash out of the way it follows your lead, but if you get hit by the rocks then your mount also suffers 2d6 points of damage.
