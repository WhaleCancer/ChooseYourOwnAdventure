# W19: Marsh Lights

Your eye is caught by an odd shifting glow. As you try to focus on it, you see a shimmering swarm of green and blue lights, as if you are looking at distant torches seen through the bottom of a bo8le. A feeling of drowsy indifference creeps upon you as you start to walk in their direction as part of your mind screams danger! The Marsh Lights are drawing you in! Test your LUCK. If you succeed you wrestle back control of your will and turn away, shivering, to continue your journey.

If you fail you stagger unthinkingly towards them, utterly distracted. The lights lead you into a pool of water and you start to drown - test your LUCK again.

If you succeed the shock of the cold water brings you to your senses and you can scramble out of the water and turn away. If you fail, you suffer 1d6 points of damage as you inhale mucky water. You must test your LUCK again each round until you succeed or die from drowning. You may, with a great effort of will, expend three points of LUCK to regain control of yourself and from this deadly peril.
