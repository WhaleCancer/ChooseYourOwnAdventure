# W38: Mirage

Upon the shimmering horizon a tantalising prospect appears; a lush green oasis that will provide you with shelter and comfort. But is it real? Make a test of your Awareness or Desert lore skills (pick only one). If you succeed you know, with sinking heart, that this is merely a mirage and not worth your time. If you fail, you are convinced of its existence and hurry in that direction - by the time you realise your mistake, you have wasted half a day of travelling.
