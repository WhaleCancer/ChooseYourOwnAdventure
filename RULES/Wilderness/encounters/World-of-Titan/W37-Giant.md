# W37: Giant

Either the sight of an enormous figure looming in the distance or, if you are in a forest or jungle, the crashing of undergrowth and shaking of the ground warn you that a giant is fast approaching. These great humanoids come in a variety of types and temperaments, but all of them are powerful and potentially dangerous. Most will a8ack adventurers on sight either to eat them or take their treasure (or both) and a smart hero will try to avoid them. The type of giant you face depends on your environment, but your options are the same.

● Hide: you look around for a place to conceal yourself, make a Sneaking test to see if you succeed.

● Flee! You turn and run or ride away. Test your Running or Riding skill to see if you are fast enough.

If you succeed, add half a day to your travel time as you backtrack, if you fail he catches up with you.

● Talk your way out of it: A risky move, but you decide to try and talk your way out of it, either pleading with the giant or telling some lie to stop them eating you. Make a Con or Etique8e skill roll but with a -3 penalty to convince it, providing substantial food (8 meals) or treasure (10d6gp) gets rid of the skill roll penalty. If you fail you must fight.

● Test your LUCK - you stand stock still and plead with the gods to save you. Test your LUCK - if successful the giant wanders off in another direction, never to be seen again. If you fail you may choose another option or fight.
