# W40: Young Dragon

One of the most terrifying aspects of encountering a dragon in the wild is that unless you are looking in the direction from which it approaches, the first thing you might know about it is a scorching burst of flame that sets you and your companions alight! These creatures, even as juveniles, are powerful enough to quickly and easily overcome most heroes leaving behind either a charred pile of bones or a patch of blood spa8ered ground and the mystery of footprints that suddenly come to a stop.

Firstly you must test your LUCK - if you fail you are facing the wrong way and the Young Dragon will begin by swooping across and breathing on you. If you pass you spy its terrifying form in the distance and can either stand your ground (see the combat details below) or hide. If you wish to hide you can test your Sneaking or Region Lore to find a place that will be out of sight, or you can test your LUCK again - if you succeed the dragon hasn’t noticed you and flies on.  The type of dragon depends on the environment.

Once fighting begins you must either defeat it in some way or test your LUCK; if you succeed on that test the Young Dragon knocks you unconscious and then decides for some reason not to devour you; you wake up a few hours later with a sore head. It will, even if you pass your LUCK test, devour any horses, mules etc you have with you.
