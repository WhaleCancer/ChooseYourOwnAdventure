# W21: Boatman

Drifting lazily along is a small but sturdy looking boat crewed by a shaggy haired man dressed in waterproof leathers. He is sat in at the rear of his craft, with a fishing pole in hand. He is close enough that you could hail him if you wish. What do you do?

● Watch silently and let him pass, you’ve no need for his assistance today.

● Hail him and wave, asking him to come over so you can talk. He folds the sail and steers his craft near to talk. Make a Bargain roll. If you succeed he agrees to take you across the water for a fee of 5gp. If you fail, he demands 10gp for his services. If you are willing to pay his fee, you reduce the travel time for this area to one day - the boatman is very familiar with the fastest routes. He is not able to carry large loads (such as wagons) so if you have these, you must leave them behind if you wish to travel by boat. If you wish to take a horse or mule on his boat, you must pass a Riding test to coax your beast on board.
