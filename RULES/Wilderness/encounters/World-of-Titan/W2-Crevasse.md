# W2: Crevasse

With a great rumbling and a sound like a thousand thunderclaps, a great rent opens in the ground before you! Firstly, you must roll against Acrobatics (or Riding if mounted) to avoid tumbling down - if you fail, take 1d6 damage as the ground threatens to swallow you up. When you recover you see that deep fissures now stretch away for some distance to either side, still quivering stone cracks with crumbling rock walls. You must choose to either work your way around this obstacle (add ½ day to your travel time) or climb down and up the other side. If you wish to try and cross the crevasse, test against your Climbing skill - you must succeed twice (once to climb down and once to climb out the other side). Each failure sees you slither and fall down the rough stone, suffering 1d6 points of STAMINA damage.

Feature: The crevasse should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test.
