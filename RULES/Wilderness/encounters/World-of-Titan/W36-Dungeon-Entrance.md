# W36: Dungeon Entrance

You have stumbled across the entrance to a dungeon!

You’ve seen it before any of the monsters have spotted you, so you can ignore it if you want and carry on. On the other hand, if you are feeling adventurous you can stop your journey here and investigate. Create a dungeon as described in Chapter 5! The dungeon has 1d6+3 sections.  This dungeon does not form part of any missionsyou are engaged in.
