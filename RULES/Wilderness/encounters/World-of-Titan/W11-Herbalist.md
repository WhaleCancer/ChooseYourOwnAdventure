# W11: Herbalist

Waist high in a patch of brambles you spy a woman dressed in stout outdoor clothing and wearing a broad brimmed hat to keep off the sun and rain. She is picking at the plants about her, evidently looking for something. As you approach she notices you and stops her foraging. You notice that she does have a heavy looking cudgel at her side. What do you do?

● Wave a greeting at the woman and leave her be.

Move on with your adventure.

● Approach and strike up a conversation. Make an Etique8e skill test - if you fail, so does the conversation and you decide to move on. If you succeed, the Herbalist will offer to sell you a Curative Salve for 30gp and freely gives you some help with directions (gain +1 to your Region Lore skill).

● A lone woman out in the wild? You draw your sword and advance - she gives a shriek of anger and pulls a large potion bo8le out from her clothing.

Before you can stop her, she quaffs it down in one gulp and disappears in a puff of green smoke!

Stunned, you move forward and examine the area - poking about in the bushes, you see she dropped a gourd of strange liquid in her haste to escape you. But what is it? If you take it, record it as ‘Unknown Salve’.

Should you wish to use it, roll 1d6. On a 1-2 it is poison and causes 1d6 points of damage. On a 3-6 it is a curative and restores 1d6 points of health. If you have the Healing or Herbalism skills, you can make a test to identify it before you use it.
