# W39: Leper Colony

You see in the distance a small collection of huts gathered around a small stone temple, with smoke rising from the chimneys and even at a distance you can see people moving about. You decide to approach a bit closer, hoping to find somewhere to rest safely or trade some supplies. It seems to be a tiny hamlet but just as you are about to enter you hear something that chills you - the ringing of the lepers bell! A chill runs through your body and you pull your cloak across your nose and mouth, just as one of the residents comes from behind a hut and spots you. As well as the bell, they are wearing rags and bandages and evidence of their illness is clear upon their face and exposed skin. They hold out their hand and ask ‘do you bring alms to us wretches, stranger?’ You may:

● Reel away in fear and horror, you have no business here. You stumble and run until you feel you are at a safe distance.

● Stand your ground and steady yourself. Provided you keep your distance, there is no danger. You signal the man to stay where they are, proceed to place some of your food on the ground (deduct a number of meals, at least four) before backing away.

The leper thanks you profusely and offers to pray for you. In your next combat you have +2 bonus to your rolls (skill and damage).

● These wretches need your help, no ma8er the risk.

You enter the colony and move among the lepers, offering what you can in healing and comfort. You find out who some of them are and promise to ask for help at the next se8lement you come to. You provide them with some food (deduct 2d6 meals) and after doing what you can, you leave. The prayers of the lepers go with you and grant +1 bonus to all your rolls for three days, but you must also test your LUCK. If you pass, you have avoided catching the disease. If you fail, you have contracted Leprosy. You will lose one point of SKILL each month until you die

- this can only be healed by visiting a temple dedicated to one of the gods of good (Galana, Telak etc) and making a ‘donation’ of 10d6gp. Feature: The Leper Colony should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test. You may only help them once per month.
