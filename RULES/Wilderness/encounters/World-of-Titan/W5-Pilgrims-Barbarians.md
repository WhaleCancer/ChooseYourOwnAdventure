# W5: Pilgrims / Barbarians

There are many noises you might expect to hear in the wilderness, but singing is not one of them.

Peering ahead you can see a band of travellers moving across your path, dressed in unusual clothing and moving in a naturalistic, almost dancelike way.

They are playing instruments and singing or chanting in a language you don’t recognise. They don’t seem to have seen you yet. What do you do?

● This is clearly a trap of some kind. Warily you edge around keeping a distance and carry on your way.

● Come a bit closer and talk to them for a while. Roll 1d6 - on a 1-3: You discover that they are pilgrims travelling to a festival of some sort and are happy to share some information. Add +1 to your next Region Lore roll. You may also join them for a while, going along with the party for the rest of day. They provide you with 2 meals worth of food but this costs you half a day of travel. On a 4-6: You discover they are barbarian nomads and you have intruded on their territory - one of their warriors steps forward and challenges you. Barbarian SK 7, ST 10 Weapon: Battle Axe Armour: Leather Hauberk. They will concede the fight once reduced to 3 STAMINA or less - if you accept they offer you 2 meals as a token of respect, if you continue the fight the others flee your wrath.
