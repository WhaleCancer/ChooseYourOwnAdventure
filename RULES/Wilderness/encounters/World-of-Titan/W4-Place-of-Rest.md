# W4: Place of Rest

Cresting a small ridge you come across a sight which gladdens your heart. Before you lies a place of rest (an oasis in the desert, a sylvan glade in the forest and so on) where you can recover for a while. Resting here restores 1 STAMINA (even without sleeping). You may refresh your water and foraging here provides you with 2 meals of rations, without needing a skill test. Restore one LUCK for discovering this place.

Feature: The Place of Rest should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test. You only restore one point of LUCK on your first visit.
