# W20: Quicksand

By ill-chance, you have stumbled into a large area of quicksand! What you thought was merely soft ground is now treacherously sucking you down, a sudden lurch and you are up to your waist and sinking fast. You can try to get out by cunning or brute force. If you wish to haul yourself out, test against your Strength skill - you must achieve three successes to get out. Each time you fail, you suffer 1d3 points of damage (no armour or dodge) as the ground squeezes the life out of you. Alternatively you can stay calm and try to work out a means to get back to safe ground - test against your Trap Knowledge skill. Again you must succeed three times to escape and each failure costs you 1d3 points of damage.

*In the desert or other dry places, the quicksand is a dust trap - extremely fine, dry sand that has collected in a hollow and is covered by a thin layer of packed sand that disguises the threat.
