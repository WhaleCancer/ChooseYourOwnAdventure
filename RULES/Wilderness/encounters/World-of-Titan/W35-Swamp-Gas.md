# W35: Swamp Gas

A strange smell alerts you to the fact that you have unwi8ingly wandered into a cloud of flammable swamp gas, which could burst into flame at any moment. Make a Marsh & Swamp region lore skill to see if you can work out how to get out - if you succeed, you carefully work your way out of the danger zone and may carry on your journey. If you fail, you cause a spark and ignite the gas - the explosion causes you (and any mount) 2d6 damage, you may test your Dodge skill to reduce this by half.
