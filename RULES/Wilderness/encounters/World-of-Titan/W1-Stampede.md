# W1: Stampede

You are trudging along through some unremarkable scenery when you start to hear a strange noise. At first you ignore it, thinking it to be some nearby stream or brook of no consequence, but the noise starts to grow louder and louder.   As panic starts to set in you look around and notice a cloud of dust and commotion approaching you - it’s a stampede of giant ants!

Something, somewhere has set these creatures in motion and now they are rushing across the ground trampling and tearing at everything in their path.

Unless you have some magic to get you out of the way you are going to have to dash to get out of their way! Firstly, make an Awareness skill test to see how far away the stampede was before you noticed it.

Next, make a Strength or Acrobatics skill roll to dash out of the way of the stampede. If you succeeded in your Awareness skill test you get a +3 bonus to this test. If you succeed, you have managed to find a place of safety in time and watch in awe as the stampede passes you by. If you fail your skill test you are caught in the stampede. You are bashed about, knocked over and struck by the biting jaws of the ants as they pass by. Roll a d6. The result tells you how many times you must roll as if you had been hit by a mace! If you survive you are battered and bruised but may continue with your adventures.
