# W16: Patrol

Although most nobles don’t bother with sending out troops to patrol, a few of the more vigorous like to send some men out to keep their lands clear of bandits and monsters. These are usually low ranking conscripts, drawn from the peasantry, carrying out a number of days duty required by their lord and heavily armed adventurers are something they will be keen to deal with peacefully. They are armed and armoured but will only be carrying a day’s worth of rations, as this type of patrol will be operating on an established route between se8lements or homesteads.

Spear, Shortbow Armour:

Leather Hauberk If you do a8ack them, you must fight all five of them at once.  What do you do?

● You greet them and exchange a few pleasantries before moving on. You’ve no need of help today.

● Smiling warmly you come over and make conversation, asking them about the land and seeing what help they can give you. Make an Etique8e skill test. If you succeed they are happy to talk - gain +2 to your next Region Lore roll for this area and if you are lost you may make a roll immediately as they set you right. If you fail the etique8e test, they are suspicious and surly, asking you to move on and cause no (more) trouble.

● Pu8ing on your most heroic demeanour, you a8empt to recruit them. Make a test of Leadership skill - if you succeed, they agree to travel with you and act as your guide until you leave this area! You gain +3 to Region Lore rolls whilst they are with you and they will fight alongside you if needed. If you fail, they are unimpressed and remind you that you are not their lord or master, so be on your way.
