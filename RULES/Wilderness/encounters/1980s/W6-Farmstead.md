2-6 Desert (De), Tundra & Ice (Tu) With little warning you come across a lonely building, a single storey house of wood and corrugated metal with a small wood fenced animal pen on one side and a garden on the other.

If the Farmstead is abandoned, although it is rundown and partially ruined you can use this as a sheltered Rest Stop to camp in.

If it is inhabited you see a tough, weatherbeaten man standing at the doorway awaiting your approach. He is gripping a well worn shotgun and keeping a careful eye on you, but he says nothing. At the window of the house you can see a woman and a couple of dirty-faced children also watching you silently. It’s clear that they are not accustomed to visitors. What do you do?

● You’ve no need to disturb them. You wave a hand in greeting then walk around, keeping your distance.

● Holding your hands out to show you mean no harm. You approach and introduce yourself. Make a test against your Social SKILL with +3 if you are human. If you succeed, they decide you are friendly and invite you into their small home for a meal. In addition, you can purchase up to 6 meals at 20 CAD each and the Farmsteaders provide you with detailed local knowledge, adding +2 to your next Region Lore roll.

They will also allow you to rest here overnight, but only for one night. If you fail the Social roll, the farmer is not convinced and tells you to be on your way. You can try again if you pass this farmstead another time on your travels.

● There is no law in the wilderness, and you’ll take what you need by force! Pretending to be friendly, you approach the farmer and then suddenly Attack!

He is not surprised and defends himself wildly.

Farmsteader SKILL 7 STAMINA 10 Weapon: Hunting Rifle, Armour: Leather Jacket. He adds +1 to his damage roll in fury at your attack on his home. As you fight, his wife and children pick up everything of value in the home and flee - they are gone and hidden by the time you are done. Inside the home you find 2 meals worth of food. If you pass back through this area, the farmstead will be an abandoned ruin.

Feature: The Farmstead should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test. If it is inhabited, your previous behaviour will be remembered!
