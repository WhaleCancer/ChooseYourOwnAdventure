# W26: Pit Trap

Many hunters use the wilderness as their larder and you have blundered into a pit trap left here to catch game. Make a test against your Trap Knowledge SKILL with a -2 penalty (the trap like most of its kind has been concealed) - if you succeed you have spotted the trap and can move around it with a sigh of relief. You may also choose to test your LUCK to avoid the trap.

If you fail, you crash through the branches covering the trap and tumble into the pit. Roll 1d6 - on 1-3 you slam into the ground suffering 1d6 points of damage, on a 4-6 you fall onto spikes and suffer 1d6+3 points of damage. Either way, if you survive you can carefully dig your way out of the hole.
