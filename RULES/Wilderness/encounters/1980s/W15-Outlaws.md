# W15: outlaws

You’ve been spotted by a pair of outlaws, bandits that roam the wilderness looking for victims far from the relative safety of civilization.

They are desperate men and not interested in parley

- they have been watching you and have now set an ambush, do you spot them or will they get the drop on you?

Firstly, make an opposed test against their Sneaking SKILL of 8, using your Awareness SKILL. If you succeed you have spotted them lurking behind a nearby mound of earth, but if you fail they gain the advantage of surprise in the first round, after which combat proceeds as usual. You must fight both outlaws at the same time.
