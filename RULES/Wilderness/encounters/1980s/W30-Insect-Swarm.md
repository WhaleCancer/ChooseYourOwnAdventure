# W30: Insect Swarm

As you are moving along you disturb a swarm of biting insects, some kind of huge mosquito, that were resting in the vegetation around your feet. With an angry buzz they swirl around you biting and stinging before you can cover yourself and dash out of the cloud of flu8ering wings.

The bites cause only one point of damage but  leave angry, inflamed welts on your skin. Test against your Healing special SKILL or LUCK to avoid catching a disease. If you succeed, you shiver for half a day but nothing worse happens. If you fail, roll on Table 4.3.2 Diseases.
