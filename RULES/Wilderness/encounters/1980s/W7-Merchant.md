# W7: Traveling Salesman

Rumbling along a narrow track that crosses the landscape before you comes a pickup truck with a camper shell, being driven by a middle-aged woman dressed in travelling clothes and well-worn leather boots. Upon seeing you she pulls the truck to a halt, retrieves a rifle from the front seat and holds up a hand in greeting. With the rifle held nonchalantly at her hip, pointing away from you, she seems to be not unfriendly but simply wary of a stranger on the road.

What do you do?

● You’ve no need to bargain for wares at this time.

You nod your head in greeting and move on.

● Bartering is a welcome distraction from trudging along in the wilds. You return her greeting and, being sure to keep your hands away from your weapons, approach and ask if she has anything to trade. She is mostly carrying skins and ores (neither of which has been refined) but she is willing to sell rations or any item of ‘general equipment’ for twice the usual village cost. She will buy up to 1000 CAD worth of items, paying one quarter of their usual value (any items not on the general equipment list can be sold for 2d6 × 10 CAD or 3d6 × 10 CAD with a successful Bargain skill roll - she has Bargain skill 6).

● A Traveling Salesman alone on the road? What a prize! You stifle a grin and move towards her, but she senses your intentions! Traveling Salesman SKILL 6 STAMINA 13 Weapons:

rifle, Hunting Knife.

Armour:

Flak Jacket. As you move to attack she will fire her rifle and leap into the truck, starting the engine and driving forward. You may fight her for three rounds before the traveling salesman escapes in her truck. If you do defeat her, you can recover 4d6 meals and 4d6 × 100 CAD worth of trade goods. The ores and skins are of no use to you without her contacts. The truck is yours to do with as you will, but cannot be taken directly across untracked country.
