# W40: Sasquatch

One of the most terrifying aspects of encountering a Sasquatch in the wild is that unless you are looking in the direction from which it approaches, the first thing you might know about it is a terrifying roar that freezes you in your tracks! These creatures, even smaller ones, are powerful enough to quickly and easily overcome most Characters leaving behind either mangled remains or a patch of blood-spattered ground and the mystery of footprints that suddenly come to a stop.

Firstly you must test your LUCK - if you fail you are facing the wrong way and the Sasquatch will begin by charging and attacking you. If you pass you spy its terrifying form in the distance and can either stand your ground (see the combat details below) or hide. If you wish to hide you can test your Sneaking or Region Lore to find a place that will be out of sight, or you can test your LUCK again - if you succeed the Sasquatch hasn't noticed you and moves on. The type of Sasquatch depends on the environment.

**Forest, Hills & Mountains:** Large Sasquatch SKILL 14 Att 4 damage 20 Weapon: Very Large Claw with +2, Armour: Heavy with +2 to the roll. Roar - test your LUCK (or Dodge skill) or take 4 points of damage, once every six rounds.

**Plains & Desert:** Sasquatch SKILL 11 Att 3 damage 14 Weapon: Very Large Claw with +2, Armour: Heavy with +2 to the roll. Roar - test your LUCK (or Dodge skill) or take 2 points of damage every round.

**Tundra & Ice:** Yeti SKILL 12 Att 3 damage 14 Weapon: Very Large Claw with +2 Armour: Heavy with +2 to the roll. Roar - Roll 1d6 each round. On a 1-2 it emits a bone-chilling howl causing 3 points of damage, which can be avoided with a test of LUCK or the Dodge skill.

**Rivers, Jungle, Marsh, Sea:** Sasquatch SKILL 13 Att 4 damage 18 Weapon: Very Large Claw with +2 Armour: Heavy with +2 to the roll. Roar - test your LUCK or Dodge skill or take 2 points of damage, once every three rounds.

Once fighting begins you must either defeat it in some way or test your LUCK; if you succeed on that test the Sasquatch knocks you unconscious and then decides for some reason not to kill you; you wake up a few hours later with a sore head. It will, even if you pass your LUCK test, destroy any vehicles you have with you.
