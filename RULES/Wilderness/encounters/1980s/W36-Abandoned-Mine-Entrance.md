# W36: Abandoned Mine Entrance

You have stumbled across the entrance to a abandoned mine!

You’ve seen it before any of the cryptids have spotted you, so you can ignore it if you want and carry on. On the other hand, if you are feeling adventurous you can stop your journey here and investigate. Create a abandoned mine as described in abandoned mine creation rules! The abandoned mine has 1d6+3 sections.  This abandoned mine does not form part of any missionsyou are engaged in.
