# W29: Wild Boars

With a squeak and a squeal a group of Wild Boar burst from cover nearby, probably startled by your movements.

Many of the beasts flee but three males turn and face you ready to charge. If you don’t want to fight them you can test your Animal Lore SKILL; if you succeed you use calm movements and gestures to mollify them and avoid combat. Otherwise, they snort and rush at you.
