# W23: Aggressive Plant Growth

Carelessly you have strolled into a patch of Aggressive Plant Growth, a plant that consists of a large buried bulb, several feet across, with many long spiky vines spreading out from it like a spider's web. The vines snake across the ground, hiding under the leaf li8er, and climb trees to hang from the lower branches.

Should any animal wander into the area near the Blood Vine, the tendrils will activate and a8empt to grab hold of it. As they do so the spikes dig into the flesh and start to drain the unfortunate victim of its fluids whilst dragging them slowly towards the central bulb, where they will be pulled underground for leisurely digestion. Aggressive Plant Growth are found in patches - twenty, thirty or more plants spread out across an area waiting to snare anything unfortunate enough to come close.

As the vines start to slither around you, test against Awareness. If you succeed you quickly spot the fastest route out of the patch and only spend one round fighting the Aggressive Plant Growth. If you fail the test you blunder further into the patch and must spend 1d6 rounds fighting your way out!
