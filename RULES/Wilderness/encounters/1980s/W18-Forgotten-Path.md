# W18: Forgotten Path

By great fortune you have stumbled upon an ancient path that is going in your direction! It is cut into the ground so was hidden from view until you were right upon it, but once you stumble down the crumbling banks you can see that though it is overgrown and the cobbles have been pushed aside and turned over by bushes and plants, it is still a far easier route than marching through the wilderness. Your travel time for this area is now one day (regardless of what the usual travel time is for this environment). You may restore one point of LUCK for finding it and if you return to this area you can find and use it again (though you don’t restore LUCK again). Feature: The Forgo8en Path should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test.
