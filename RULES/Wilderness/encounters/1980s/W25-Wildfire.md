# W25: Wildfire

As you move along in a daze of your own thoughts, you spot a glowing firefly bouncing in the air.

Looking closer you realise that it is not an insect but a smouldering ember trailing wisps of smoke. Your senses alerted, you peer around and see thickening smoke drifting towards you - a wildfire is approaching! Your options are to flee, try to build a fire break or try to find shelter. If you wish to flee make a Running SKILL check (or Ride if you are vehicleed). If you have some means of making fire you can try to fight fire with fire, but it is risky - you must test your LUCK to succeed. If you wish to try to find shelter (a cave or pond for example) make a Region Lore skill test to quickly spot a place to avoid the flames.

If you fail with your escape plan, the fire catches you nd you take 2d6 points of damage as the flames roar about you.

If this encounter happens at night you see it earlier and may take a detour around it, costing you half a day in travel time but not requiring any skill tests.
