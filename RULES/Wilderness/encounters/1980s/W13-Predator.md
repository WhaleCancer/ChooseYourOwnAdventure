# W13: Predator

In every wilderness there are predators and some of them are bold enough to hunt for human prey. In the mountains, a cougar might stalk across the rocks, waiting for the moment to pounce. On the plains hungry wolves lope easily across the miles, patrolling their range, always alert for the scent of prey. The type of predator will depend on the environment, but the broad nature of the encounter is always the same - you are being hunted, and must fight or become just another victim of the wilds.

The predator will try to use their territory to their advantage - make an Awareness test with a penalty of

-3 to spot them coming. If you fail the test they gain +4 to their combat roll on the first round as they take you by surprise!

The type of beast you face depends on the environment.
