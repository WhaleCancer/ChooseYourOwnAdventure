# W3: Ferocious hailstorm

For a moment there is a stillness in the air and then a crack of thunder. Seemingly out of nowhere the sky darkens and roiling black clouds appear. Is this really natural or some technology or luckal trick? As you ponder that question a ferocious hailstorm commences! Ice balls the size of apples crash down, pummeling the ground and anyone unfortunate enough to be caught without shelter. You must test your Awareness SKILL to find a place of shelter. If you fail, you take 2d6 points of damage as you are smashed about the head and shoulders by massive pieces of hail (armour rolls apply). In addition, if you have any vehicles or pack animals you must make a Riding or Animal Lore skill test or they bolt - it takes you half a day to retrieve the shivering animals. The hailstorm passes with the same eerie swiftness with which it arrived; after no more than ten minutes you are free to continue your journey. If you need to, the hailstones can be collected and melted into drinking water.
