# W14: Cryptid!

What’s that coming over the hill? Yes, it’s a cryptid.

And it may not be coming over the hill, but might be swooping out of the sky, bursting from the ground or appearing out of thin air.

There are a number of ways you can find a cryptid to fight whilst on the wilderness. The most obvious is to use the encounter tables in one of the published bestiaries, ‘cryptid encounter tables’, ‘cryptid encounter tables’ and ‘cryptid encounter tables’ which contain a variety of cryptids divided by environment.

For the sake of variety it is recommended you use as many of the bestiaries as you have available, though note that the encounter tables are not divided by difficulty, so be prepared for a challenging fight and remember to read the cryptid description fully so that you understand what you are facing.

If you do not have them available you can use the Predator encounter (W13) to quickly find an opponent or you can create a completely random cryptid. The table below will allow you to generate an opponent, which might be easy to fight or extremely difficult as its characteristics are based on the SKILL (or MENTAL) and damage of your Character.

Roll badly and you could be facing a very powerful creature indeed.

Table 6.3.2 Random cryptid Generator. Roll Separately for each trait to build up a cryptid.

*Use the SKILL and damage of the Character as the base number. For MENTAL using Characters, use their MENTAL score instead of SKILL. So a Character with SKILL of 7 who rolls a 9 on 2d6 faces a creature with SKILL 6 (i.e. their SKILL minus one).
