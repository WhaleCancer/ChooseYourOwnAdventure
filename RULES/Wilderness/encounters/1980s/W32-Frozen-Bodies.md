# W32: Frozen Bodies

You stumble across a gruesome sight - a huddle of bodies, travellers who must have been caught in a storm and have frozen to death as they tried to shelter from the cold. You can ignore this terrible warning and simply move on or try to investigate, using whatever tools you have available to scrape away the ice and search their belongings. Roll 1d6 - 1: As you loot the corpses one lurches into life - a zombie!

Zombie SKILL 6 damage 6 Weapon: Frozen Fists (treat as club) Armour: cryptid light. 2-4: Nothing of interest, 5-6: One of the corpses has a silver pendant worth 1d6 × 10 + 10 CAD.

Whatever the outcome, if you have a shovel or pickaxe (or some other means of breaking the ground) you can spend half a day digging a shallow grave for these unfortunates; restore one point of LUCK as the gods look favourably on your act of compassion.
