# W22: Settlement / Abandoned town

You’ve come across either a se8lement of some kind, one that was seemingly unknown to other people in this area, or at least the Abandoned Buildings of one. Firstly you must decide if it is appropriate to find a se8lement - if you have sent your Character off on a journey through the trackless desert, you may not want them to find a small well run town, so in that case treat it as Abandoned Buildings and use the ‘Rest Stop’ encounter instead. If you can’t decide, roll 1d6 - on 1,2 or 3 it is a Ruin (use the Rest Stop encounter) and on a 4,5 or 6 it is an inhabited se8lement.

Now must roll 2d6 to see what kind of place you have come across:

2-8 - small town 9-11 -  town 12 - city Having discovered this place, you must decide what you wish to do. You may use the rules provided in this book to generate a fully fledged se8lement, but if you only want to make a brief stop you can assume it has the Temple, Inn and Marketplace locations available to make use of. Either way, give it a name and mark it on your map - you can return here if you come this way again later without making a Region Lore roll. Finding a se8lement of any kind means that you can treat this area as having paths and tracks available, reducing the travel time to one day (the locals are willing to give at least rough directions when asked). You may also hire a guide here: See the rules at the start of this section.

Special: Once you have found a se8lement in an area, if it is a town or city any other se8lements found nearby will be small towns. If you find a city, there will not be a city in any adjoining wilderness areas (unless you require one for your campaign).
