# W8: Hunting large predatory bird

Whilst most of the dangers in the wilds are lurking close to the ground, the seasoned traveller will also keep an eye on the skies above. You have the misfortune of being spotted by a young large predatory bird out looking for a meal. Firstly, you must test your Awareness SKILL. If you succeed you hear its plaintive cry some time before it swoops and you are ready to face it. If you fail the test, its first Attack is made with the advantage of surprise (+6 to its combat roll and +2 to the damage roll).

The large predatory bird Attacks by grabbing its target in its talons, hauling it into the air and dropping it onto the ground. It will a8empt to do this 1d6 times (roll at the start of the combat and make a note of it) before giving up and looking for an easier target.

Each time the large predatory bird wins a round of combat you are grabbed in its claws and flicked up into the sky, before crashing to the ground and suffering 3d3 points of damage. A successful Acrobatics skill test reduces this to 1d3 points of damage. If you survive the 1d6 a8empts the large predatory bird gives up and moves on. If you kill the large predatory bird, it can be butchered to provide six meals worth of tough but edible food.
