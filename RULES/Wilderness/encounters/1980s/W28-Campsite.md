# W28: Campsite

As fortune would have it you come across an abandoned campsite, a place where people have recently stopped and rested. Roll 1d6 - on a 1-2 the site is occupied by four wolves (SKILL 5 damage 6 Weapon: Small Bite Armour: None) which are gnawing on some bones that were left behind - if you fight them, you must fight them all together - don’t forget to add the ganging up bonus if you are outnumbered. If two are killed the others will flee, leaving you with the campsite to yourself. On a roll of 3-5 the site is empty but you do find some neatly stacked firewood and kindling you can use to make a fire (or in a hot location, some shelter and 1d6 waterskins of water in the form of a tiny spring). On a 6 not only do you find firewood, but also a dagger, a backpack, a flint and tinder box, a cooking pot and a waterskin - the owner seems to have left in a hurry.
