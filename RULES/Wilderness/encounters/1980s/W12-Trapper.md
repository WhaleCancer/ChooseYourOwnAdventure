# W12: trapper

Making his way across the landscape you spy the lone figure of a man, dressed in furs and leathers he carries a large pack on his back festooned with a variety of implements and outdoors gear. Noticing you he stops and waves at you, though you notice his other hand moves to rest on the hilt of a sword. What do you do?

● It seems he doesn’t want to talk - you nod and, keeping your distance, move on with your travels.

● Approaching slowly you greet him and try to start a conversation. Test your Social SKILL - if you fail, he gives little response and moves away from you.

Eventually you give up and continue as you may. If you succeed, you convince him to stop for a while and talk. He is a trapper, out in the wilds hunting for animals to skin. He has little to trade but is knowledgeable about the area and can give you directions - gain +2 to your next Region Lore roll.

● This looks like a chance to wet your blade: You draw your weapon and advance. The man seems unsurprised, he spits on the ground and pulls out a wicked looking sabre.
