# W33: Bone Pile

A white glint catches your eye and as you move closer you realise there is a pile of sun bleached bones scAttered on the ground. You can ignore it or investigate. If you investigate, roll 1d6:

1 - As you approach the bones shake and form into a:

Skeleton SKILL

6 damage  5 Weapon:

Small Claw Armour: None, but it takes half damage from

bladed weapons.

2-3: You poke around for a while, but it is just a pile of old bones.

4-5: Clearly this was once a traveller like yourself - you find a dagger, a Leather Jacket and an empty waterskin. 6: Amongst the bones a flash of gold leads you to find a plain ring, worth 1d6 × 10 + 10 CAD.
