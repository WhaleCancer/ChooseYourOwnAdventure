# W10: Sacred Site

Without really noticing, you have stumbled into a circle of ancient stones, some sort of religious or spiritual site that’s been long abandoned and left to nature. Most of the stones have fallen and only by looking carefully can you make out their shapes under layers of soil and vegetation. For all its decrepitude a sense of deep calm steals over you and you feel that it would be safe to rest here.

If you forage in this area you gain a bonus of +2 to your skill rolls. If you have the Religion Lore or MENTAL Lore skills, or Second Sight, you can meditate here for an hour and receive a vision of the land from its ancient inhabitants. They will show you the land as it used to be, but this still helps you in your current journey - gain +2 to your Region lore SKILL for this area. Feature:

The Sacred Site should be noted on your map, you can find or avoid it in the future with a successful Region Lore skill test.
