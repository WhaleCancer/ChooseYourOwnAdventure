# W34: Leeches

Wading slowly through some dank muddy water that barred your way, you realise with horror that it is infested with fat leeches that are now wriggling towards you. You can make a Swim skill roll to dash to safety or lose 1d6 points of damage as they drain your blood! If you are vehicleed, make a Ride skill roll to charge out of the water or your steed loses 1d6 points of damage. If you are damaged by the leeches, roll on Table 4.3.2 Diseases.
