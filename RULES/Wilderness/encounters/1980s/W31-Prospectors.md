# W31: prospectors

You hear talking and the clinking of people moving whilst carrying equipment. Fearing an ambush you duck behind some cover and peer around.

Approaching you are four dwarves, prospectors by the looks of it, they carry pickaxes, shovels and equipment for surviving in the wilds. They haven’t noticed you yet, what do you do?

● Sticking to your hiding place you let them go past.

● Step out, calmly, and try to draw them into a conversation - make a test of Social SKILL (dwarf Characters get a +3 bonus) to find out more about the area. If you fail the conversation drifts into silence and the dwarves leave, if you succeed you gain +2 to your next Region Lore roll in this area.

● Easy prey! You leap out and Attack! Dwarf Prospector SKILL 5 damage 8 Weapon: Pickaxe (handaxe) Armour: Chain Hauberk. If you kill two of the dwarves the others will a8empt to flee. Each has 4 torches, flint & tinder, 2 meals and a waterskin.
