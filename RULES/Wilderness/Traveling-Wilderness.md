# Travelling the Wilds

Having created your map, the following section provides you with rules for making your way across it.

## Travel Time

The travel time is based on traversing the wilderness, instead of following a known path or track.

Assuming you survive the exposure, don't fall into a crevasse or get killed by bandits the next thing to work out is how long it took your Character to cross an area. In the environment and encounter description you will find tables for the travel time based on your route, the weather and terrain.

**Known path or track:** If there is a known path or track available the travel time is reduced to the best result on the Route table. You will have to decide if this option is available, probably based on the location of any settlements, though you may also decide that having a road or path is part of your campaign setting. You must still roll for weather and encounters, but you do not roll for terrain as the path avoids them.

For example: You have been asked to visit Fort Trollfear, a small military camp about 30 miles north of your current location. No one has heard from Fort Trollfear in weeks and they are worried something dreadful has happened.

Because it is a known location with supplies and troops moving back and forth, you decide that there is a well worn track leading to it, so you can follow that all the way to the fort. Having arrived there, you find it has been attacked and the small number of survivors tell you that an orc warband came from caves about twenty miles to the east. In this case, there is no reason for a path to exist and if you want to track down the orcs and exact revenge, your Character will need to navigate the wilderness.

If there is no path, when your Character enters a new area make a test against their Region Lore Skill (or SKILL or MAGIC if you have no points in the relevant Region Lore). Each type of environment has its own associated Region Lore. A woodsman with a bonus in Forest Lore will not be any the wiser when trying to navigate in the mountains. You may also use the Navigation skill from the Characters Companion if you wish.

If the Character succeeds very significantly (gets 4 less then their skill or a critical success), you find some unmapped trails and paths, which will lead you across the area quickly. If you just succeed, you will cross in the normal time for that environment as specified in the description. If you fail the roll, your journey will take longer - it's assumed you don't give up and turn around though that is always an option!

The amount of extra time will vary depending on the environment - see the separate descriptions in the Route table to find out what the penalty is.

If you fail the roll badly (how much depends on the environment) or if you critically fail, your Character will get lost. This will add to your travel time and require you to roll again - getting lost means that you make no progress across the terrain.

Each time you successfully traverse an area of the map, gain +1 to your Region Lore for that particular area. This increases each time to a maximum of +6 as you gain familiarity with that piece of territory.

Remember that this bonus only applies to that single area and not to others of the same type. For example, D'Sta Leafshadow has one point in Region Lore - Forest and has criss-crossed the 'Wolf Wood' near Ludria many times, gaining +6 to his Region Lore roll for that area. When D'Sta travels to the 'High Wood' far to the west, he no longer has this bonus and goes back to rolling against his usual Region Lore skill.

Once you have assessed your route, weather and terrain add these together to find out how long you will spend crossing this area. You should round the time to the nearest day - so if your total is 2 ¼ days to cross some hills, treat it as two days (on the second day you push on into the night before resting for example). This determines how many encounters you need to roll and the amount of meals you will consume.

**Example:** D'Sta Leafshadow has SKILL 7 and Region Lore: Forest of 1, for a total Skill of 8. He enters a new area of forest he wants to cross from west to east. D'Sta makes a test and rolls 4 on 2d6 - he has succeeded by 4! He finds an old woodcutter's trail and passes through in ½ day (barring weather and terrain) as indicated in the description for the Forest environment. Had he rolled a 7, he would have kept to his direction through the trees, but it would take him 1 day. If he had rolled an 11, failing by 3, he spends ½ day wandering in the forest and so it takes him 1½ days (before weather and terrain). If D'Sta rolled a 12 he would get lost, spend 1 day walking in circles and have to start again - and make another Region Lore: Forest roll.

Before he works out exactly how long it takes him to cross this forest, he must roll for weather and terrain, then total it all together. D'Sta rolls on the weather table, getting a 2 on 1d6 for fair weather. On the terrain table he is less fortunate rolling a 6, indicating some broken terrain that takes 1 day extra to cross. Putting it all together, he enters the forest, finds a path (with a roll of 4 against his Region Lore: Forest of 8) but at some point the path is interrupted by broken terrain, adding one day. So his travel time is 1½ day - which he rounds down to one day as he pushes on late into the evening to get across. He has to make one encounter roll for that day. If he had worse rolls, it could have taken 2 or more days to get across this area and he would have to roll an encounter and weather for each day he spent in the forest. It may seem excessive to take multiple days to cross 10 miles of territory, but remember that this is for a Character crossing an uncharted wilderness. It's tough!

## Roads & Settlements

As noted above, the travel times are based on forging your way through an untracked wilderness, though clearly roads and paths do exist in some places. You should feel free to add them where appropriate, based on your setting. We suggest the following guidelines for routes between settlements.

**City:** Has direct routes to all settlements in its area and all adjacent areas. Routes to towns extend to all within two areas (20 miles) and routes to cities extend to all within six areas (60 miles).

**Town:** Has direct routes to all settlements in its area and other towns or cities within two areas (20 miles). Villages in adjacent areas have a 1-2 chance on 1d6 to have a direct route.

**Village:** Has direct routes to all settlements in its area. Settlements in adjacent areas have a 1 in 6 chance to have a direct route.

So if a Character has already explored part of the world, or knows of some settlements, they can travel along a known route and get the benefit of a faster travel time (weather and encounters still apply).

## Forced March

A Character may wish to move faster than normal pace for a while. You can choose to undertake a forced march, in which all travel times are halved but at the end of each day you must test against your STAMINA to see if you are exhausted by it. At the end of the first day, make the test using 2d6. On the second day, use 3d6, 4d6 on the fourth day and so on. If you fail the test you have pushed to the point of collapse - you are exhausted and must rest without moving for one whole day to recover.

If your Character has points in the Strength Skill, these can be included as a bonus to your rolls, so a Character with 2 points in Strength skill rolls 2d6-2 on the first day, then 3d6-2 on the second day and so on until they stop or collapse as above.

At the end of a forced march you may not attempt another one until you have spent the same number of days recovering as you did marching - so if the Character spends three days at forced march pace they cannot start another one until a further three days of normal travel or rest have passed.

## Encounters

Having an interesting encounter in the wilderness is far less likely than in a settlement, but every day can bring some new surprises - good or bad. The standard number of encounters each day is one (the wilds may be dangerous, but a lot of time is spent travelling through mundane landscapes which pose no particular threat or opportunity).

Each environment has an encounter table that should be rolled on for every day spent travelling through it.

A skilled Character can use their wits and knowledge to shift the odds. If you choose to, you can make a Region Lore skill roll with a -3 penalty - if you succeed, you can decide to either sneak through the wilderness and avoid problems (have no encounters) or use your abilities to find all the interesting things you can (have two encounters in one day).

### Encounters at Night

It is assumed that Characters, however brave they may be, find sheltered and hidden places to bed down for the night, so there is no requirement to roll for a night encounter if you are not travelling. If you wish to increase the difficulty, roll for a night encounter as well as a day encounter, but only apply the result if it could seek you out - so you would encounter a Predator, but not a Crevasse - the Predator sniffs you out in the darkness!

### Standard Encounter Options

As a reminder, in Chapter 3 we detailed a number of encounter options. A Character may wish to use this (or others they can think of) to deal with the challenges they face.

**Fight:** Begin combat and resolve it using the normal combat rules, you may use a ranged weapon or spell in the first round if you have spotted your target.

**Flee:** Run from combat; test your LUCK to escape or suffer a 'free hit'.

**Sneak:** Attempt to use Sneaking to get past your target, consider what bonuses or penalties apply.

**Talk:** Use a social skill, you must share a means of communication with your target.

**Trick:** Attempt to trick your target in some way, a variety of means including magic can be used.

**Bribe:** Offer your target an amount of gold to ignore your actions.

**Feed:** Offer an animal food in order to distract it.

## Travelling at Night

Most adventurers will stop and rest once the sun has set, but if you absolutely must push on, you can.

However, unless you have some means of seeing long distances at night you are at a severe disadvantage. A Character or group of Characters without darkseeing, nightvision or a similar effect has a -6 to all Awareness tests to spot danger, -6 to any Region Lore rolls they take at night and must make a Region Lore test (with the -6 penalty) or find themselves lost; in effect they spend the night walking in circles and make no progress.

## Foraging

Staying alive in the wilderness means either bringing your own food or finding it as you travel. This is covered by the Hunting and Fishing Skills.

Using these skills takes ½ day to make a skill test, on a success the Character obtains 2d6 meals. Each area on the map will have its own conditions that may affect your chance of obtaining food - see the table below.

Any points in the Animal Lore Skill can be used as a bonus for this skill test. Once you've found out what the foraging conditions are for an area, make a note of it in case you pass back through.

**Survivor Talent:** A Character with this talent does not need to make a roll to forage for themselves and can gather 2 meals for every 2 hours spent foraging, as well as finding shelter in harsh environments where exposure can be a problem. They may choose to use their talent or make a Hunting or Fishing skill test, the choice is theirs.

## Exposure

In addition to the hazards of encountering beasts or falling into a crevasse, the wilds can kill with heat, cold or dehydration. For dehydration, it is assumed that a Character's rations include sufficient water to sustain them so no additional rules will be given beyond those in the AFF rulebook. Exposure to extreme cold or heat, often resulting from severe weather (weather conditions are rolled for daily) is worked out as a skill test as the Character uses their experience and wits to avoid the climatic effects. The Character must use their SKILL, MAGIC and Region Lore skill to pass the target number provided, or they suffer 1d6 points of STAMINA damage due to exposure.

For example, Wyrdly Dume is crossing a desert. He rolls a 6 for the weather and checking the table sees that a sandstorm has blown in with a target number for exposure of 14. Wyrdly has SKILL 5 and Desert Lore 1 for a skill of 6. He is wearing desert clothing so has +2 to his roll.

Wyrdly rolls 8 for a total of 6+2+8 = 16 - enough to beat the target, so he is safe from the sandstorm. Had he rolled a 3 for a total of 6+2+3 = 11 he would have failed and suffered exposure, taking 1d6 points of STAMINA damage as the brutal heat and wind tested his endurance.

Bonuses to this test can be obtained by having the right equipment or magic to hand, some examples are as follows.

**Exposure to cold:** Warm Clothing: +2, Tent: +3, Tinderbox: +2, Potion of Warming: +3.

**Exposure to heat:** Desert Clothing: +2, Extra Waterskin: +2, Potion of Cooling: +3. Other items or magical effects (the minor magic spells Heat and Cool and the priest ability Sanctuary) can be assigned a bonus based on their description. In most cases a well equipped Character can avoid exposure, but woe betide the person who ventures into the wilds without appropriate equipment.

## Food & Drink

Rules for starvation are provided in the core AFF Rulebook - a Character that doesn't eat and drink for one day loses 2 points of STAMINA. In this book we refer to 'meals' instead of rations, as one meal is sufficient to provide enough sustenance for one day or restore 2 STAMINA. One ration provides two meals. A waterskin holds enough water for one day and can be replenished from natural sources, unless you are in a Desert region. Remember to take enough food and water for you and your mounts when you venture into the wilds!

## Riding vs Walking

The main benefit of riding vs walking is not speed (few mounts can maintain high speed for long distances with a rider on top and very few could do so without a path or trail), but the ability to carry extra equipment and supplies. On untracked land a horse or pony will not be much faster than walking, but it will certainly allow you to carry more food and items such as tents or a change of clothes. A stout pony is truly the wanderers' friend. If you are able to cross an area more quickly by riding, it is noted in the environment description.

If you are fortunate enough to have a road or trail to follow then a mounted person can travel great distances on even, well maintained ground - it is not really possible to cover all eventualities (different types of mount and terrain have different interactions) so you will need to assess this for yourself. Horses can cover up to 30 miles a day at walking pace and more at a trot or canter, but that assumes they are well rested and provided with fodder and water. Other mounts have different paces and endurance - use your common sense!

## The Changing Seasons

The influence of the seasons is rather dependent on how you wish to play your campaign and keep track of time. The complexities involved would require an additional chapter at least which seems excessive when many Characters would rather treat the changing seasons as a 'background effect' rather than worry about them too much. If you wish to apply some changes, the following adjustments are suggested and you should feel free to add more as you see fit.

An entire campaign played out in the depths of winter or the sultry heat of summer has its appeal, but the details require your imagination.

### Seasonal Adjustments

**Spring / Autumn:** No adjustments.

**Summer:** In the heat of summer add +2 to weather rolls in the Jungle & Desert locations and suffer a -3 penalty to exposure tests in those locations.

**Winter:** In the chill of winter add +2 to weather rolls in the Mountains & Tundra locations and suffer a -3 penalty to exposure tests in those locations. Any beasts you encounter are weakened by starvation and have -2 STAMINA. All foraging tests (Hunting & Fishing) have a -2 penalty.

## Using LUCK whilst exploring

If all else fails, a Character can call upon whichever gods happen to be watching and ask for aid. At any time, you may test your LUCK to find help. If you fail, nothing happens and you stagger on with only your wits to save you. If you succeed you come across a traveller, a friendly and knowledgeable guide that will help you from your current area to the next one you wish to explore and provide you with one day's worth of rations (2 meals), after which they will disappear. You may only test your LUCK like this once per day.

## Hiring a Guide

If you start from a settlement (village, town or city) or encounter one, you may try and hire a guide. Firstly, make an Etiquette skill roll to see if you can find one.

If you fail, you can't find anyone to help you, if you succeed you have found a local with sufficient understanding of the area to guide you in whichever direction you choose. The guide will stay with you for three areas distance from the area containing their home. The guide charges 5gp each day (if you don't pay them, they slip away in the night). They carry their own rations and basic travelling gear. They will not fight for you.

When you have a guide with you, you reduce your travel time for each area to one day. You must still roll for weather and encounters, but you do not roll for terrain (they know how to take you past the worst places).
