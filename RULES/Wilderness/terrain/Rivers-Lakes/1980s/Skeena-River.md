# Skeena River

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Sea-Lore|Sea Lore]]

**Rivers & Lakes (Ri)** You're standing on the banks of the Skeena River, a major river in northwest British Columbia. The water flows before you, wide and powerful, its course cutting through the coastal mountains to the sea. The current is strong, and crossing requires careful planning or a boat.

The Skeena River is a vital transportation route in the northwest, supporting fishing, logging, and First Nations communities. The river is dangerous—the current can sweep you away, and the water is cold even in summer. The banks are often steep and unstable, with rockfalls and erosion creating constant hazards. The river can provide fresh water and food, but it's also a barrier that must be crossed. Out here, you're at the mercy of the water and the weather, and the river doesn't care if you make it to the other side.

## Rules

**Special:** The travel time is based on finding places to ford the rivers. If you wish to, you can make two tests of Swimming to reduce the travel time to 1 day, but each failure causes 1d6 of drowning damage.

**Special:** You may test your LUCK to find some transport. If you succeed, you discover a washed up rowboat, just large enough to accommodate you. It holds together long enough to make the opposite shore, before falling to pieces. Reduce travel time to 1 day, but remember to deduct a point of LUCK.
