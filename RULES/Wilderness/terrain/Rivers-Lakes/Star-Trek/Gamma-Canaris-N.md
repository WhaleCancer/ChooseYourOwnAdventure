# Gamma Canaris N

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Sea-Lore|Sea Lore]]

**Rivers & Lakes (Ri)** The waterways of Gamma Canaris N stretch before you, a network of rivers and lakes that crisscross the planet's surface. The water is clear in places, murky in others, and you can't be sure what lies beneath the surface. The rivers flow through the jungle, creating natural barriers that must be crossed, while the lakes offer both opportunity and danger—a source of fresh water, but also a place where predators might lurk.

The waterways of Gamma Canaris N are navigable, but they're also dangerous. The rivers can be swift and treacherous, with hidden currents and submerged obstacles. The lakes are deep and mysterious, and you can't be sure what lives in their depths. Crossing these waterways requires skill and luck—a wrong step can mean being swept away by the current or dragged under by something in the water. The waterways are a lifeline in this hostile world, but they're also a constant challenge.

## Rules

**Special:** The travel time is based on finding places to ford the rivers. If you wish to, you can make two tests of Swimming to reduce the travel time to 1 day, but each failure causes 1d6 of drowning damage.

**Special:** You may test your LUCK to find some transport. If you succeed, you discover a washed up rowboat, just large enough to accommodate you. It holds together long enough to make the opposite shore, before falling to pieces. Reduce travel time to 1 day, but remember to deduct a point of LUCK.
