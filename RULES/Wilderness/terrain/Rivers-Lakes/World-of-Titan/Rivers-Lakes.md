# Rivers & Lakes

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Sea-Lore|Sea Lore]]

**Rivers & Lakes (Ri)** Sunlight glinting off the water and the cries of water fowl sooth you as you approach the river's edge, though as you get closer a cloud of midges rises from the surface. The wilderness is never easy. From the banks you can see that the channel meanders along to a lake which is large enough to contain a couple of islands. The sounds of the river are pleasant and taking a drink of fresh water is a relief from the stale contents of your skins, but you can't ignore the problem facing you: how do you get across?

## Rules

**Special:** The travel time is based on finding places to ford the rivers. If you wish to, you can make two tests of Swimming to reduce the travel time to 1 day, but each failure causes 1d6 of drowning damage.

**Special:** You may test your LUCK to find some transport. If you succeed, you discover a washed up rowboat, just large enough to accommodate you. It holds together long enough to make the opposite shore, before falling to pieces. Reduce travel time to 1 day, but remember to deduct a point of LUCK.
