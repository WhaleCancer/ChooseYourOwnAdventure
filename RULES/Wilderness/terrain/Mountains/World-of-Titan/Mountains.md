# Mountains

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Mountain-Lore|Mountain Lore]]

**Mountains (Mo)** As the morning sun rises it glances off the snowy slopes that surround you, momentarily blinding you. The cold thin air leaves you gasping for breath as you raise your eyes to the summit, but it is hidden from view, shrouded by clouds that promise further snowfall. You are well above the surrounding lands but there is still further to trudge upwards in the hope of finding a pass through to the lands beyond.

## Rules

**Special:** Climbing in the mountains will afford you spectacular views - add +2 to your next Region Lore roll when you leave the mountains.

**Special:** The air cools as you ascend the mountains. If you do not have wood to make a fire you lose 2 points of STAMINA each day. (2 day's wood occupies one slot). You can find wood by testing SKILL or Region Lore: Mountains to acquire 1d6 days of firewood.
