# Coast Mountains

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Mountain-Lore|Mountain Lore]]

**Mountains (Mo)** You're in the Coast Mountains, standing among some of the highest peaks in British Columbia. The mountains rise around you, their snow-capped summits hidden in clouds. The air is thin and cold, and every breath is a reminder of how high you are. Below, you can see the valleys stretching away, but the only way forward is up and over the pass ahead.

This is some of the most rugged terrain in North America. The mountains are unforgiving—one wrong step can mean a fall that ends in death. The weather can change in minutes, turning a clear day into a blizzard. The trails are steep and treacherous, and getting lost means certain death. The mountains hold secrets: old mining claims, abandoned cabins, and the bones of those who came before. Out here, you're at the mercy of the elements, and the mountains don't care if you survive.

## Rules

**Special:** Climbing in the mountains will afford you spectacular views - add +2 to your next Region Lore roll when you leave the mountains.

**Special:** The air cools as you ascend the mountains. If you do not have wood to make a fire you lose 2 points of STAMINA each day. (2 day's wood occupies one slot). You can find wood by testing SKILL or Region Lore: Mountains to acquire 1d6 days of firewood.
