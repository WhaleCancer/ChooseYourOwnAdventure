# Interior Ranges

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Mountain-Lore|Mountain Lore]]

**Mountains (Mo)** You're in the interior mountain ranges of British Columbia—the Columbia, Cariboo, and Skeena Mountains. The peaks rise around you, their snow-capped summits hidden in clouds. The air is thin and cold, and every breath is a reminder of how high you are. Below, you can see the valleys stretching away, but the only way forward is up and over the pass ahead.

This is mining and logging country, where the mountains are crisscrossed with old mining roads and logging tracks. The terrain is challenging—steep slopes, loose rock, and the constant threat of avalanches make travel slow and difficult. The mountains hold secrets: old mining claims, abandoned cabins, and the bones of those who came before. Out here, you're at the mercy of the elements, and the mountains don't care if you survive.

## Rules

**Special:** Climbing in the mountains will afford you spectacular views - add +2 to your next Region Lore roll when you leave the mountains.

**Special:** The air cools as you ascend the mountains. If you do not have wood to make a fire you lose 2 points of STAMINA each day. (2 day's wood occupies one slot). You can find wood by testing SKILL or Region Lore: Mountains to acquire 1d6 days of firewood.
