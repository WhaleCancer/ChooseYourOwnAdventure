# Janus VI

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Mountain-Lore|Mountain Lore]]

**Mountains (Mo)** The jagged peaks of Janus VI tower above you, their rocky faces scarred by centuries of mining operations. This is a world of tunnels and caves, where the Horta once roamed and where mineral wealth lies buried deep beneath the surface. The mountains are treacherous—rock falls are common, and the thin air at altitude makes every step a struggle. The mining tunnels that crisscross the mountains offer shelter, but they're also dark, dangerous, and easy to get lost in.

The mountains of Janus VI are a maze of peaks and valleys, with few easy passes. The constant mining activity has left the terrain unstable in places, and the risk of cave-ins or rock slides is ever-present. The high altitude means cold temperatures and thin air, making survival difficult without proper equipment. The mountains hold secrets—abandoned mines, hidden tunnels, and who knows what else buried in the rock.

## Rules
