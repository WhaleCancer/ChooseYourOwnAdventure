# Gamma Trianguli VI

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** The rolling grasslands of Gamma Trianguli VI stretch to the horizon in every direction. The primitive culture that calls this world home has learned to live in harmony with the vast plains, but for Starfleet personnel, the open terrain offers both opportunity and danger. The endless grasslands make navigation relatively straightforward, but they also provide no cover from threats—whether native predators or hostile forces.

The plains are crisscrossed with game trails and the occasional primitive road, but the lack of landmarks can be disorienting. The native inhabitants move across these grasslands with an ease born of generations, but off-worlders can easily become lost in the featureless expanse. The open sky above offers no protection from the elements, and sudden storms can sweep across the plains with little warning.
