# Thompson Valley

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** You're standing in the Thompson Valley, where the semi-arid grasslands roll between the mountains. The landscape is a patchwork of sagebrush, bunchgrass, and scattered groves of Ponderosa pine. The Thompson River cuts through the valley, its waters providing life to the farms and ranches that dot the landscape. The air is dry, and the sun beats down relentlessly during the day, though the nights can be surprisingly cool.

This is a mix of ranch and farm country, where cattle graze on the open grasslands and small farms grow hay and vegetables along the river. The terrain is deceptively easy—the rolling hills look gentle, but they can hide gullies and dry creek beds that slow your progress. The open nature of the land means you can see for miles, but it also means you're exposed. The valley is crisscrossed with irrigation ditches and canals, and getting lost in the maze of fields and roads is easier than you'd think.
