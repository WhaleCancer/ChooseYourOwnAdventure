# Okanagan Valley

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** You're standing in the Okanagan Valley, where semi-arid grasslands roll between the mountains. The landscape is a patchwork of sagebrush, bunchgrass, and the occasional grove of Ponderosa pine. In the distance, you can see the orchards that make this region famous—rows of apple and cherry trees that stretch across the valley floor. The air is dry, and the sun beats down relentlessly during the day, though the nights can be surprisingly cool.

This is ranch country, where cattle graze on the open grasslands and the occasional farmhouse sits isolated in the vast expanse. The terrain is deceptively easy—the rolling hills look gentle, but they can hide gullies and dry creek beds that slow your progress. The open nature of the land means you can see for miles, but it also means you're exposed. If something goes wrong out here, help is a long way away, and the isolation can be as dangerous as any predator.
