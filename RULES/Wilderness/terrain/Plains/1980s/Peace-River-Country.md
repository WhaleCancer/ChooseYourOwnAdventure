# Peace River Country

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** You're standing in the Peace River Country, where the vast northern plains stretch to the horizon in every direction. The landscape is a sea of golden wheat and canola fields, broken only by the occasional farmhouse or grain elevator. The air is crisp and clear, and the sky seems to go on forever. In the distance, you can see the dark line of the boreal forest, but here on the plains, the land is as flat as a pancake.

This is grain country, where the rich soil of the Peace River valley supports some of the largest farms in Canada. The terrain is easy—the roads are straight and the fields are vast, but the distances are enormous. A farm that looks close might be miles away, and getting lost in the endless fields is easier than you'd think. The isolation is absolute—if something goes wrong out here, help is a long way away, and the harsh northern winters make survival a constant challenge.
