# Cariboo Plateau

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** You're standing on the Cariboo Plateau, where rolling grasslands stretch across the interior of British Columbia. The landscape is a mix of bunchgrass, sagebrush, and scattered groves of aspen and cottonwood. The air is dry and clear, and the sun beats down on the exposed slopes. In the distance, you can see the mountains rising on the horizon, but here on the plateau, the land rolls in gentle waves.

This is cattle country, where the open grasslands support some of the largest ranches in Canada. The terrain is deceptively easy—the rolling hills look gentle, but they can hide gullies and dry creek beds that slow your progress. The open nature of the land means you can see for miles, but it also means you're exposed. The isolation is absolute—if something goes wrong out here, help is a long way away, and the harsh winters make survival a constant challenge.
