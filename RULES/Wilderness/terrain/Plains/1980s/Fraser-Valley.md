# Fraser Valley

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** You're standing in the Fraser Valley, where the flat floodplain stretches out before you in a patchwork of fields and farms. The landscape is dominated by dairy farms, berry fields, and vegetable crops that stretch to the horizon. The air is heavy with the smell of manure and fresh-cut hay, and the constant hum of irrigation systems fills the air. In the distance, you can see the mountains rising on either side of the valley, but here on the floor, the land is as flat as a table.

This is some of the most productive farmland in Canada, where the rich soil of the Fraser River floodplain supports a thriving agricultural industry. The terrain is easy—the roads are straight and well-maintained, and the fields are laid out in neat grids. But the open nature of the land means you're exposed, and the isolation of the farms means help can be far away. The valley is crisscrossed with ditches and canals, and getting lost in the maze of fields and roads is easier than you'd think.
