# Plains

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Plains (Pl)** The landscape rolls away from you in seemingly endless waves of green and brown. Grass ripples in the breeze and small glades hold out the offer of shade, though they also be a hiding place for all manner of creatures. Shading your eyes from the sun you survey the vista, noting a small farm in the distance close to where dust rises from what must be a wagon trail. The plains are open country often criss-crossed with tracks and usually amongst the easiest places to travel but, for the same reasons, they are also home to hunters of many kinds. You are as likely to meet a wyvern as a merchant, so beware!
