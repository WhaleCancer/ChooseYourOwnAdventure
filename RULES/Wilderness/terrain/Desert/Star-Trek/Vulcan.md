# Vulcan

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Desert-Lore|Desert Lore]]

**Desert (De)** The harsh, red sands of Vulcan stretch endlessly before you. The twin suns beat down mercilessly, and the thin atmosphere offers little protection from the UV radiation. The landscape is dominated by towering rock spires, ancient ruins carved into cliff faces, and the occasional oasis that serves as a lifeline in this unforgiving world. The heat is intense—even in the shade, temperatures can be lethal to off-worlders.

The Vulcans have adapted to these conditions over millennia, but for humans and other species, the desert is a death trap. Sandstorms can appear with little warning, reducing visibility to zero and scouring exposed skin. The lack of water is the greatest threat—dehydration sets in quickly, and without proper equipment, you'll be dead within hours. The ancient Vulcan philosophy of logic and control was born from the need to survive in this environment, where emotion and panic lead to certain death.

## Rules

**Special:** If an encounter requires you to test your Awareness skill, you gain a +1 bonus due to the open nature of your surroundings, but also suffer -1 to Sneaking skill tests.

**Special:** A waterskin will hold water for one person or mount for one day. If you run out of water, you suffer 1d6 STAMINA damage on the first day, 2d6 damage on the next day, then 3d6 and so on. Running out of water in the desert is generally deadly! Camels can go up to two weeks without water.
