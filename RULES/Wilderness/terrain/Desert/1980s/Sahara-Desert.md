# Sahara Desert

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Desert-Lore|Desert Lore]]

**Desert (De)** The endless dunes of the Sahara stretch to the horizon in every direction. You're somewhere in the vast expanse between Libya, Chad, and Niger—a region torn by conflict and shifting alliances. The sand gets into everything: your clothes, your equipment, your food. The sun is a merciless enemy, and water is worth more than gold.

This is the desert of the Toyota War, where technicals race across the sand and ancient trade routes are now smuggling routes. The Tuareg nomads know these sands like the back of their hand, but for outsiders, it's a death sentence. Sandstorms can last for days, and getting lost means certain death. The desert hides ancient secrets—cave paintings, lost cities, and the bones of those who came before. Out here, you're at the mercy of the elements and the people who call this place home.

## Rules

**Special:** If an encounter requires you to test your Awareness skill, you gain a +1 bonus due to the open nature of your surroundings, but also suffer -1 to Sneaking skill tests.

**Special:** A waterskin will hold water for one person or mount for one day. If you run out of water, you suffer 1d6 STAMINA damage on the first day, 2d6 damage on the next day, then 3d6 and so on. Running out of water in the desert is generally deadly! Camels can go up to two weeks without water.
