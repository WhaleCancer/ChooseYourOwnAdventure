# Desert

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Desert-Lore|Desert Lore]]

**Desert (De)** Shading your eyes against the glaring sun you take a sip of water to get some moisture. You resist the urge to drink too much, knowing that it may be some time before you can find more. The wind whips sand into your face as you scan the horizon for clues about your journey. As you step forward there is a crunch - looking down, you realise you have trodden on an ancient skull. It grins at you one final time before the sands trickle back in place, covering it for eternity. A grim fate awaits those who get lost in the desert.

## Rules

**Special:** If an encounter requires you to test your Awareness skill, you gain a +1 bonus due to the open nature of your surroundings, but also suffer -1 to Sneaking skill tests.

**Special:** A waterskin will hold water for one person or mount for one day. If you run out of water, you suffer 1d6 STAMINA damage on the first day, 2d6 damage on the next day, then 3d6 and so on. Running out of water in the desert is generally deadly! Camels can go up to two weeks without water.
