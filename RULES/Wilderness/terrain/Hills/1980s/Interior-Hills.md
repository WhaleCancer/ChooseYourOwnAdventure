# Interior Hills

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Hills (Hi)** You're in the rolling hills of interior British Columbia, where the landscape rises and falls in a seemingly endless series of ridges and valleys. The hills are covered in a mix of grasslands, scattered trees, and rocky outcroppings. The sun beats down on the exposed slopes, but the valleys offer shade and the occasional stream or small lake.

This is ranch and farm country, where the hills are dotted with isolated homesteads and the occasional small town nestled in a valley. The terrain is challenging—there are no flat paths, and every journey requires constant climbing and descending. The hills can hide dangers: sudden drop-offs, loose rock, and the occasional abandoned mine or prospector's claim. The isolation is absolute—if you get into trouble out here, you're on your own until you can make it to the next valley or ridge top.
