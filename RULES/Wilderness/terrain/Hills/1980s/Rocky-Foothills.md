# Rocky Foothills

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Hills (Hi)** You're in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where the eastern slopes rise from the prairies. The hills are covered in a mix of grasslands, scattered trees, and rocky outcroppings. The terrain is steep and rugged, with deep valleys carved by rivers and streams. The air is dry and clear, and the constant wind makes every journey a challenge.

This is ranch and mining country, where the hills are crisscrossed with old cattle trails and mining tracks. The terrain is challenging—steep slopes, loose rock, and sudden drop-offs make travel slow and difficult. The hills can hide dangers: unstable slopes, abandoned mines, and the occasional grizzly bear. The isolation is absolute—if you get into trouble out here, you're on your own until you can make it to the next valley or ridge top.
