# Coast Foothills

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Hills (Hi)** You're in the foothills of the Coast Mountains, where the western slopes rise from the coastal lowlands. The hills are covered in dense forest that gives way to alpine meadows at higher elevations. The terrain is steep and rugged, with deep valleys carved by rivers and streams. The air is cool and damp, and the constant threat of rain makes every journey a challenge.

This is logging and mining country, where the hills are crisscrossed with old logging roads and mining tracks. The terrain is challenging—steep slopes, loose rock, and dense underbrush make travel slow and difficult. The hills can hide dangers: sudden drop-offs, unstable slopes, and the occasional abandoned mine or logging camp. The isolation is absolute—if you get into trouble out here, you're on your own until you can make it to the next valley or ridge top.
