# Hills

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Hills (Hi)** Cresting yet another peak, you stop to take a drink and find an apple in your pack. The sun is out and toiling up and down slopes all morning has left you sweating. You look around, hoping to spot a path that leads along the top of the ridge or the base of a valley, anything that will offer you a few hours of travel along reasonably flat ground but nothing stands out.

The landscape is dominated by the up and down of rises, crests, dips, vales, knolls, elevations, fells and mounts, all of which you will have to labour up or scramble down. On their tops, they are often windswept and rocky with trees and bushes becoming more common as you descend the slopes, often finding a stream or small lake at the lowest points. It is a mixed land, full of variety.
