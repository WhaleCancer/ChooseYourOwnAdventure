# Taurus II

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Plains-Lore|Plains Lore]]

**Hills (Hi)** The rolling hills of Taurus II stretch before you, a landscape of constant ups and downs that makes every journey a test of endurance. The hills are covered in strange, alien vegetation, and the rocky outcroppings provide both shelter and hiding places for the planet's dangerous native creatures. The terrain is deceptively difficult—what looks like a gentle slope can hide treacherous footing and sudden drops.

The hills of Taurus II offer no easy paths. Every route requires climbing and descending, and the constant elevation changes exhaust even the fittest crew members. The rocky peaks provide excellent vantage points, but they're also exposed to the elements and whatever predators call this world home. The valleys between hills offer some respite, but they can also be traps, with limited escape routes if something goes wrong.
