# Argelius II

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Sea-Lore|Sea Lore]]

**Shoreline & Sea (Sh)** The beautiful coastlines of Argelius II stretch before you, where pristine beaches meet crystal-clear waters. This is a pleasure planet, known throughout the Federation for its stunning natural beauty and welcoming atmosphere. The shoreline is dotted with resorts and settlements, but away from the populated areas, the coast is wild and untamed.

The waters of Argelius II are generally calm and safe, but the shoreline itself can be treacherous. Rocky outcroppings, hidden coves, and sudden drop-offs make navigation challenging. The tides are gentle, but they still control access to certain areas. The coastline offers both opportunity and danger—a means of travel if you have a boat, but also a barrier that must be crossed. The beauty of Argelius II is undeniable, but even paradise has its dangers.

## Rules

**Special:** The shoreline cuts across your direction of travel and you must turn aside by one quarter turn (if you were heading north you may now go east or west, if you were heading east you may go north or south and so on). This can only be avoided if you have a means to cross the water, either a boat or some magical means. If you have access to a boat, the travel time is one day.
