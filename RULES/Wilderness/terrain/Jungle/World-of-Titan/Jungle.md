# Jungle

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Jungle-Lore|Jungle Lore]]

**Jungle (Ju)** The heat you could bear, the humidity you may endure but the insects are vicious and driving you to madness. Barely a moment passes without having to swat away some bloodsucking bug that wants to drain you of your fluids. Some of them are large enough to make you wonder what manner of creature is feeding them! Unlike the forests, the canopy here has not prevented a riot of vegetation from sprouting at every level. A tangle of creepers bar your path in every direction. It is almost impossible to move quietly and your progress is accompanied by the squawks of startled birds and other, more disturbing, grunts and growls. You are acutely aware of the density of life here in the vibrant green of the jungle.
