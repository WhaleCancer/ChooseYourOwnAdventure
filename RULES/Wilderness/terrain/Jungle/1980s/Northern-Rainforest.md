# Northern Rainforest

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Jungle-Lore|Jungle Lore]]

**Jungle (Ju)** You're deep in the northern rainforest of British Columbia, where the Great Bear Rainforest stretches along the remote north coast. The trees tower above you—ancient cedars and hemlocks that have stood for centuries, their massive trunks covered in thick moss. The undergrowth is a tangle of ferns, devil's club, and fallen logs, making every step a challenge. The air is heavy with moisture, and the constant drip of water from the canopy above keeps everything perpetually damp.

This is some of the most remote and untouched wilderness in North America. The rainforest is dense and impenetrable in places, with no trails and no easy paths. The terrain is challenging—fallen logs, thick underbrush, and the constant threat of getting lost in the endless green. The rainforest can provide everything you need to survive, but it's also easy to become disoriented in the uniform landscape. Out here, you're truly on your own, and the rainforest doesn't care if you make it back to civilization.
