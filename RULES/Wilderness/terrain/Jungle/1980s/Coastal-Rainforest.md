# Coastal Rainforest

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Jungle-Lore|Jungle Lore]]

**Jungle (Ju)** You're deep in the coastal rainforest of British Columbia, where the Pacific Ocean meets the mountains. The trees tower above you—ancient western red cedars, Sitka spruce, and western hemlocks that have stood for centuries. The undergrowth is a tangle of ferns, moss, and fallen logs, making every step a challenge. The air is heavy with moisture, and the constant drip of water from the canopy above keeps everything perpetually damp.

This is the rainforest of the west coast, from Vancouver Island to Haida Gwaii. The rainforest is dense and impenetrable in places, with no trails and no easy paths. The terrain is challenging—fallen logs, thick underbrush, and the constant threat of getting lost in the endless green. The rainforest can provide everything you need to survive, but it's also easy to become disoriented in the uniform landscape. Out here, you're truly on your own, and the rainforest doesn't care if you make it back to civilization.
