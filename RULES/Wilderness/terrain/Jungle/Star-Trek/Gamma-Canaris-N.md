# Gamma Canaris N

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Jungle-Lore|Jungle Lore]]

**Jungle (Ju)** The dense, alien jungle of Gamma Canaris N closes around you, a riot of strange vegetation and dangerous predators. The heat is oppressive, and the humidity makes every breath feel heavy. The jungle is alive with movement—creatures you can see and others you can only hear, rustling in the undergrowth. The canopy above blocks out most of the sunlight, creating a dim, green-tinted world where shadows hide threats.

The jungle of Gamma Canaris N is a death trap for the unprepared. The dense vegetation makes movement slow and difficult, and the constant threat of predators means you can never relax. The jungle provides everything needed for survival, but it also hides dangers at every turn. Getting lost here is easy, and the lack of landmarks makes navigation nearly impossible. The jungle doesn't care if you survive—it's been here long before you arrived, and it will be here long after you're gone.
