# Beta III

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Forest-Lore|Forest Lore]]

**Forest (Fo)** The dense temperate forests of Beta III close around you, the massive trees creating a canopy that blocks out most of the sunlight. This is the world where Landru's followers once lived in perfect harmony, but now the forests hold secrets and dangers. The undergrowth is thick, and the gnarled roots of ancient trees make every step treacherous. The air is still and heavy, filled with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.

The forests of Beta III are deceptively peaceful on the surface, but they hide the remnants of a controlled society and the dangers that come with such control. The trees themselves seem to watch, and the lack of landmarks makes navigation nearly impossible without proper equipment. The forest provides everything needed for survival—water, shelter, and food—but getting lost here means becoming part of the forest itself, lost to the endless green.
