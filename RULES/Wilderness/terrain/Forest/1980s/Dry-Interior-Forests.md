# Dry Interior Forests

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Forest-Lore|Forest Lore]]

**Forest (Fo)** You're in the dry interior forests, where Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir grow in open stands among grasslands and sagebrush. The trees are well-spaced, their bark thick and fire-resistant. The forest floor is a mix of pine needles, dry grass, and exposed soil. The air is dry and warm, and the silence is broken only by the wind through the branches and the occasional call of a jay.

This is the forest of the southern interior—the Okanagan, Thompson, and surrounding regions. The terrain is more open than the coastal forests, but the isolation is still absolute. The trees are smaller and more widely spaced, but the distances are vast, and getting lost here means certain death. The forest provides shelter and firewood, but the heat and lack of water are constant threats. Out here, you're on your own, and the dry interior forest doesn't care if you make it back to civilization.
