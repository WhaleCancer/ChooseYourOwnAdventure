# Subalpine Forests

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Forest-Lore|Forest Lore]]

**Forest (Fo)** You're in the subalpine forests, where the trees grow shorter and more gnarled as you climb higher into the mountains. Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir dominate the landscape, their branches twisted by wind and snow. The forest floor is a mix of moss, alpine flowers, and exposed rock. The air is thin and cold, and the silence is broken only by the wind through the branches and the occasional call of a mountain bird.

This is the forest of the high country—stretching along the BC/Alberta border and through the mountain regions. The terrain is less dense than the lowland forests, but the elevation makes every step a challenge. The trees are smaller, but the views are spectacular, and getting lost here means certain death. The forest provides shelter and firewood, but the cold and thin air are constant threats. Out here, you're on your own, and the subalpine forest doesn't care if you make it back to civilization.
