# Central Interior Forests

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Forest-Lore|Forest Lore]]

**Forest (Fo)** You're deep in the central interior forests of British Columbia, surrounded by towering conifers—Douglas fir, western red cedar, and hemlock. The forest floor is carpeted with needles and moss, and the canopy above filters the sunlight into a dim, green-tinted twilight. The air is cool and damp, filled with the earthy scent of decomposing wood and the sharp tang of pine resin.

This is logging country, where old-growth stands alternate with clear-cuts and second-growth forests. The terrain is rugged—steep slopes, fallen logs, and dense underbrush make travel slow and difficult. The forest can provide everything you need to survive, but it's easy to get turned around in the endless trees. Old logging roads crisscross the area, but many are overgrown and impassable. Out here, you're on your own, and the forest doesn't care if you make it back to civilization.
