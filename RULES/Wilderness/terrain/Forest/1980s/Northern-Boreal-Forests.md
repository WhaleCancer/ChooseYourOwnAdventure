# Northern Boreal Forests

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Forest-Lore|Forest Lore]]

**Forest (Fo)** You're in the northern boreal forests, where the trees are smaller and more widely spaced than the coastal rainforests. Black spruce and lodgepole pine dominate the landscape, their branches heavy with lichen. The forest floor is a mix of moss, low shrubs, and exposed rock. The air is crisp and cool, and the silence is broken only by the wind through the branches and the occasional call of a raven.

This is the forest of the north—stretching from northern British Columbia into the Yukon and northern Alberta. The terrain is less dense than the coastal forests, but the isolation is absolute. The trees are smaller, but the distances are vast, and getting lost here means certain death. The forest provides shelter and firewood, but the cold is a constant threat. Out here, you're on your own, and the boreal forest doesn't care if you make it back to civilization.
