# Forest

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Forest-Lore|Forest Lore]]

**Forest (Fo)** A deep green fills the canopy as you crunch across the leaves that litter the ground, making sure to avoid tripping on the gnarled tree roots. You must not relax too much however. The leaf litter is an excellent place for a predator to hide, the canopy above you provides another place from which to ambush and as you move deeper in you notice how the trees have closed in, and the air seems sickly. Are you sure you didn't hear something rustling in the undergrowth? It might be time to draw your sword…. The forests of the world provide homes to all manner of creatures and people, both good and bad. They can provide you with everything you need to survive, but it is also easy to get lost amongst the endless trees.
