# Coastal Salt Marshes

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Marsh-Lore|Marsh Lore]]

**Marsh & Swamp (Ma)** You're in the coastal salt marshes of British Columbia, where the land meets the sea in a complex network of tidal channels, mudflats, and saltwater pools. The ground is soft and unstable, and every step sinks into the mud. The air is heavy with the smell of salt, decay, and the rich organic scent of the marsh. The tides control everything here—what's dry land at low tide becomes impassable water at high tide.

This is a landscape in constant flux, where the boundary between land and sea is never fixed. The mud is treacherous, hiding deep channels and unstable ground that can trap the unwary. The saltwater pools are home to a variety of life, but they're also breeding grounds for insects that swarm in clouds. The mists that rise from the marsh reduce visibility, and the lack of landmarks makes navigation difficult. Out here, you're at the mercy of the tides and the weather, and the marsh doesn't care if you make it back to solid ground.

## Rules

**Special:** The mud and soft ground make it hard to keep your footing. Combat suffers a -1 penalty and movement skills are at -2. Mists, rising constantly from the pools, create barriers to sight: -1 Awareness.
