# Gamma Hydra IV

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Marsh-Lore|Marsh Lore]]

**Marsh & Swamp (Ma)** The fetid swamps of Gamma Hydra IV stretch before you, a landscape of standing water, mud, and strange alien vegetation. The air is thick with moisture and the stench of decay, and the constant mists that rise from the pools reduce visibility to mere meters. The swamp is alive with movement—creatures you can see slithering through the water and others you can only hear, making disturbing sounds in the darkness.

The swamps of Gamma Hydra IV are a death trap. The mud is treacherous, hiding deep pools and quicksand-like areas that can swallow a person whole. The constant moisture rots equipment and clothing, and the lack of solid ground makes every step a risk. The mists that rise from the pools create disorienting conditions, and it's easy to become lost in the featureless landscape. The swamp doesn't care if you survive—it's been here for millennia, and it will be here long after you're gone.

## Rules

**Special:** The mud and soft ground make it hard to keep your footing. Combat suffers a -1 penalty and movement skills are at -2. Mists, rising constantly from the pools, create barriers to sight: -1 Awareness.
