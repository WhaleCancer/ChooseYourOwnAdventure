# Yukon Territory

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Arctic-Lore|Arctic Lore]]

**Tundra & Ice (Tu)** You're standing in the vast, frozen wilderness of the Yukon Territory. The endless white stretches to the horizon, broken only by stunted black spruce trees and the occasional rocky outcropping. Your breath forms clouds that freeze on your beard, and the cold seeps through even the best winter gear. In the distance, you can hear the howl of a wolf pack—or maybe it's just the wind playing tricks on your mind.

This is the land of the midnight sun in summer and endless darkness in winter. The permafrost makes the ground treacherous, hiding frozen streams and unstable ground beneath a deceptive layer of snow. The isolation is absolute—you could walk for days without seeing another soul, and if something goes wrong, help is a long way away. The old trapper's cabins and abandoned mining claims dot the landscape like ghosts, reminders that this land has claimed many who came before you. The cold doesn't just bite—it kills, and it kills fast if you're not prepared.

## Rules

**Special:** If an encounter requires you to test your Awareness skill, you gain a +2 bonus due to the sparse nature of your surroundings. It's hard to hide on an icy plain. This also means your Sneaking skill has a -2 penalty.

**Special:** Out on the tundra, icy winds like frozen daggers cut into you. If you do not have sufficient wood to make a fire you lose 2 points of STAMINA each day as the cold enters your bones. Two day's worth of firewood occupies one encumbrance slot.
