# Andoria

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Arctic-Lore|Arctic Lore]]

**Tundra & Ice (Tu)** The perpetual twilight of Andoria casts everything in shades of blue and white. Your breath freezes instantly in the sub-zero atmosphere, and the ice beneath your feet crunches with each step. The landscape is dominated by massive ice formations, frozen lakes, and the occasional geothermal vent that provides the only warmth on this frozen moon. The Andorian architecture—carved into ice caves and built from native materials—blends almost invisibly with the terrain.

The extreme cold is your constant enemy. Even with thermal suits, exposure can be deadly in minutes. The ice can conceal dangerous crevasses, and the frequent ice storms can reduce visibility to zero. However, the open terrain means you can see threats coming from a distance—if you can survive long enough to spot them. The Andorians themselves are adapted to these conditions, moving with an ease that seems almost supernatural to off-worlders.

## Rules

**Special:** If an encounter requires you to test your Awareness skill, you gain a +2 bonus due to the sparse nature of your surroundings. It's hard to hide on an icy plain. This also means your Sneaking skill has a -2 penalty.

**Special:** Out on the tundra, icy winds like frozen daggers cut into you. If you do not have sufficient wood to make a fire you lose 2 points of STAMINA each day as the cold enters your bones. Two day's worth of firewood occupies one encumbrance slot.
