# Tundra & Ice

**Related Skill:** [[RULES/Special-Skills/MENTAL/Lore/Arctic-Lore|Arctic Lore]]

**Tundra & Ice (Tu)** Stamping your boots on the ground to get some feeling back in your toes you peer out from your fur lined hood, surveying the land ahead of you. The monotony of the drifting snow is broken here and there by a stand of pine trees or an outcropping of rock but the overall impression is of emptiness and stillness.

Everything here has been frozen into place (yourself included if you are not careful) and whilst that makes it unlikely that you will face much opposition in your travels, it also means that your progress will be very noticeable to anything that is watching. The biggest danger in this desolate landscape is the land itself - ice and snow can hide a crevasse or pool and the biting cold threatens to drain you of the energy you need to keep moving. On the plus side, the relative flatness makes keeping track of any landmarks a lot easier.

## Rules

**Special:** If an encounter requires you to test your Awareness skill, you gain a +2 bonus due to the sparse nature of your surroundings. It's hard to hide on an icy plain. This also means your Sneaking skill has a -2 penalty.

**Special:** Out on the tundra, icy winds like frozen daggers cut into you. If you do not have sufficient wood to make a fire you lose 2 points of STAMINA each day as the cold enters your bones. Two day's worth of firewood occupies one encumbrance slot.
