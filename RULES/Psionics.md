# Psionics

Although not every science‑fiction game needs psychic powers, EPIC’s X‑Files‑meets‑X‑Com tone assumes that **psionics are real**—rare, frightening, and tightly bound up with whatever the aliens actually are. Governments call it “parapsychology” in public reports, “remote viewing” on budget sheets, and much worse names in redacted files.

Some humans are born with a spark of this talent. Others only awaken it after contact with alien artifacts, abductions, or experiments. Alien minds themselves appear to use similar principles, but at an inhuman scale. Learning psionics lets the Characters fight on that battlefield—but it also exposes them to the same corrupting influences that shaped their enemies.

## Psionics Rules

### The PSIONICS Characteristic and PSI Points

- A psionic Character gains an additional Characteristic: **PSIONICS**.  
- PSIONICS describes how strong their psychic potential is, from **0 to 7** for starting Characters (0 = no talent).  
- A psionic Character also has a pool of **PSI points**, equal to **3 × PSIONICS**. PSI points are spent to power abilities.  
- After a full night’s rest (or equivalent secure downtime), all spent PSI points are **fully restored**. The Director may allow partial recovery through meditation, drugs, or alien devices.

### Psionic Abilities and Traditions

A psionic character belongs to **one psionic Tradition** (see below), which defines how their powers look and what abilities they can learn.

- Each **psionic ability** is treated as a **Skill** with a rank from 0–6.  
- At character creation, the Character buys one or more psionic abilities from their Tradition as Skills, and sets their PSIONICS score as agreed with the Game Master.  
- After play begins, PSIONICS and psionic abilities can be increased exactly like other Skills and Characteristics.

Different groups interpret psionics through different lenses:  
scientific institutes with EEG caps and Faraday cages, wild cults muttering in basements, Indigenous traditions, doomsday preachers, and alien initiations. Mechanically the powers work the same; only the flavour and consequences change.

## Using Psionic Abilities

### Activation

To use a psionic ability:

1. The player declares which ability they are activating and how many **PSI points** they will spend (usually the **base cost of 1 PSI** unless the ability says otherwise).  
2. The psionicist makes a **PSIONICS + Ability Rank** test against a Difficulty set by the Director (typically equal to the target’s opposing roll for hostile powers, or a fixed value for simple tasks).  
3. If the test **succeeds**, the ability functions as described and the PSI points are deducted from the pool.  
4. If the test **fails**, the ability fizzles and **no PSI points are spent** unless stated otherwise.

Most psionic abilities take a **full round** to activate and cannot normally be combined with other actions, unless the ability description or Combat Options say otherwise.

### Pushing the Power

Before rolling, a psionicist may declare that they are **pushing** an ability:

- For each additional **PSI point** spent beyond the normal cost, they gain **+1 to the activation roll**, to a maximum bonus equal to their PSIONICS score.  
- Overuse of pushing makes it more likely they will be tempted to draw on **Darker forces** (see Dark Temptation, below).

### Resistance

If an ability directly affects an unwilling target (mind control, fear, telepathic intrusion, etc.), that target may resist:

- The psionicist rolls **PSIONICS + Ability Rank**.  
- The target rolls **PSIONICS + appropriate mental ability** if they are psionically aware, or **SKILL + Willpower / Mental Strength** (or a similar trait) if they are not.  
- If the target’s total is higher, the power is **resisted**. Any PSI cost is still paid.

### Psionic Damage

Some abilities inflict direct mental or psychic damage. Use the following **Psionic Damage track** in place of normal weapon damage:

| Roll | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7+ |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| Damage (STAMINA) | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 6 |

Psionic damage normally **ignores physical armour**, as it attacks the mind directly. Some alien materials, psionic shields, or specially prepared technology may provide protection at the Director’s discretion.

Abilities that manifest as physical phenomena (e.g. telekinetic blows, psychic blades made solid) may allow armour to reduce the damage as usual.

---

## Psionic Fumbles

When a psionic test **fumbles** (two 1s, or however your system defines a fumble), strange and dangerous side‑effects ripple out. Roll **2D6** on the Psionic Fumble Table:

| 2D6 | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 2 | A violent backlash throws the psionicist to the ground; they lose their next action and take 1D3 STAMINA damage that bypasses armour. |
| 3 | Their mind blanks—temporary **‑1D6 PSIONICS** (minimum 0), recovering at 1 point per day. |
| 4 | Everyone within 3 metres feels a numbing wave of static; they lose their next action, including allies. |
| 5 | The power hits the **wrong target** (nearest viable subject other than the intended one). |
| 6 | The power fizzles; the psionicist still loses the normal PSI cost. |
| 7 | Harmless weirdness: strange lights, nosebleeds, phantom whispers. No rules effect, but unnerving. |
| 8 | The psionicist is **stunned**, suffering ‑2 to all actions until the end of next round. |
| 9 | The psionicist loses 1D6 PSI points in addition to the normal cost. |
| 10 | A psionic flare deals **Psionic Damage** (use the table above) to everyone within 5 metres, including the psionicist. |
| 11 | The psionicist’s temporary PSIONICS drops to **0**; they cannot use powers for the rest of the session. Recovery requires rest and possibly medical/occult attention. |
| 12 | Something from **outside** notices the failed attempt. The Director may immediately introduce an alien presence, psychic echo, or ongoing hallucinations as a new complication. |

## Dark Temptation and Psionic Taint

Every psionicist touches something beyond ordinary human experience. Some feel it as divine light, others as alien whispers or a yawning dark between the stars.

Any psionic character may attempt to tap this **Dark Temptation** in a moment of crisis. This does **not** take their action; it modifies one power they are about to use.

The player chooses one of:

- **+2 bonus** to the PSIONICS roll to activate a power.  
- **+1 effective rank** to a psionic ability for one use (cannot exceed rank 7).  
- **Gain 1D6 PSI points** immediately (may exceed normal maximum for the scene).

After resolving the power, the psionicist must make a **LUCK test**:

- On **success**, nothing further happens—the power came from “within,” or at least did not leave a mark this time.  
- On **failure**, choose one:
  - The psionicist **loses 1D3 LUCK permanently**, or  
  - The psionicist is compelled to act in a way the Director rules is spiritually or morally corrosive (cruel, selfish, needlessly violent, or in line with alien/occult agendas).

If the LUCK test is a **double 6**, the psionicist gains the benefit but also becomes **Tainted**. A Tainted psionicist:

- Finds it easier to call on Dark Temptation (the Director may allow an extra +1 bonus when they do so),  
- Radiates an unsettling aura that sensitive NPCs and animals can sense, and  
- Risks eventual loss of control: another double‑6 LUCK test while tapping Dark Temptation may mean the character becomes an NPC, fully aligned with the alien or occult force behind their powers.

Taint can sometimes be removed through **serious sacrifice, exorcism, or long‑term atonement**, at the Director’s discretion.

## Psionic Traditions (Overview)

The full list of traditions and abilities can grow as the campaign uncovers more alien lore and human experiments. For EPIC’s starting state, the Director may use the following foundations:

- **Physical Adept** – Boosts the psionicist’s own body: superhuman reflexes, leaps, dodges, and psychic blades. Often arises in martial arts monasteries, special forces programmes, or cult “warrior monks.”  
- **Academic Psionicist** – Classic telepathy, astral projection, clairvoyance, precognition, and mind shields, usually trained at secretive universities, research institutes, or government labs.  
- **Mental Healer** – Empathy, psychic diagnosis, healing of trauma and possession, protective wards. Found in backwoods spiritual retreats, quiet wards in big hospitals, or underground support networks.  
- **Dark Psionic / Cultist** – Choke, domination, terror, draining life or sanity. Powers often mirror those of hostile NPCs and alien thralls.  
- **Wild Psionics** – Untrained, explosive gifts: uncontrolled bursts, fire‑starting, EMP shocks, and raw telekinetic waves. As much curse as blessing.

Each Tradition can be implemented using eight or so abilities chosen from the reference material you already have, with the above rules providing the shared framework. As your X‑Com phase progresses, you can unlock **new traditions** (for example, Astronavigator‑style alien navigation powers) as separate research topics, much like advanced cyberware.

Directors should make clear in‑world that psionics, like cyberware, offer **real power at a spiritual and psychological price**. Some agencies will treat psionicists as precious assets, others as contaminated liabilities, and a few as the vanguard of humanity's next, possibly doomed, step.
