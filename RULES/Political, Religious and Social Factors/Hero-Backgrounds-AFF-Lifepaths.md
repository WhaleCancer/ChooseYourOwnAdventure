# 7.4 Hero Backgrounds: AFF Lifepaths

This section provides optional ideas to help build a hero's background and character. Players are free to reroll or replace suggestions they dislike. The core idea is to encourage thought about the hero's origin and personality.

These options supplement the normal hero creation process and can help in developing special skills.

## What sort of person is my hero?

Asking questions to define a hero's background is important, but not all questions need immediate, exhaustive answers. These questions help build a picture of the hero and why they decided to embark on their quest.

## Physical appearance

"Advanced Fighting Fantasy" doesn't require precise physical details like height or weight. General characteristics include:
- **Humans**: Vary widely in appearance
- **Elves**: Tall and slender
- **Dwarves**: Short and broad

Consider adding distinguishing features like a scar, birthmark, limp, or memorable hairstyle to the character sheet.

## Age

There are no modifiers based on age, but it's important for the hero's story. Consider:
- **Young heroes**: Why did they leave home at such a tender age for adventuring?
- **Older heroes**: What was their life before the quest and why did they leave it behind?

**Lifespans:**
- **Humans**: Normal lifespan
- **Elves**: 200-250 years
- **Dwarves**: 100-150 years

A hero's age (young, old, or in between) does not impact characteristics or skill points.

## Origin

Where is your hero from? Three great continents exist on Titan: Allansia, Khul, and The Old World. Each continent contains wilderness, towns, and cities. A hero can be from any of these and any environment (e.g., great capital, tiny village in a swamp).

Use available maps to pick a place of origin, which should be reflected in the choice of Region Lore skills.

**Racial distribution:**
- **Humans**: Widely spread
- **Elves**: Tend to live in places of great natural beauty
- **Dwarves**: Often make homes underground, with exceptions for every group

## The Gods

A hero playing as a priest or paladin must choose a god to follow. For other heroes, it's an open question: does the hero have a particular faith, no faith, or simply acknowledge all gods without worship?

The gods are fairly active and important on Titan, making it rare for someone to ignore them.

## Family & Clan

What was your family background and what sort of society did they live in? What was their social status?

This doesn't determine skills but might affect hero development over time. Common occupations on Titan include labourers, craftsmen, merchants, scribes, nobles, or soldiers. Make a note if the hero's family background was particularly different.

## The Hero's Motivation

Why did you become a hero? What were you doing before you decided to start adventuring?

Refer to Section 7.2 "Social Status & Rank" for possible motivations. There are uncountable reasons why a hero might take up a sword or spellbook. Think of a motivation that suits the rest of their story.

## Allies & Enemies

Who do you love or hate, and who loves or hates you? Do you have a particular group you want to protect or harm? Do you have specific friends or allies you can turn to when things are tough?

## Birth Month

See [Birth Month (World of Titan)](Hero-Backgrounds/World-of-Titan/Birth-Month.md) for details on birth month effects in the World of Titan setting.

## Birth Year

See [Birth Year (World of Titan)](Hero-Backgrounds/World-of-Titan/Birth-Year.md) for details on the animal cycle and birth year effects in the World of Titan setting.

## Starting Wealth

All heroes start with basic equipment (see the 'Hero Creation' section in the AFF Rulebook). The starting wealth roll replaces the standard 2d6gp. This wealth roll does not affect a character's social rank.

Players are encouraged to explain their starting wealth, such as being a "rich peasant" who found gold or a "poor lord" with mismanaged land and titles.

**Exception:** If a hero has chosen the 'Status' or 'Knighted' talents, the "Alternative Starting Wealth" table below may be ignored.

### Alternative Starting Wealth

| 2d6 | Human | Elf | Dwarf |
|-----|-------|-----|-------|
| 2 | Destitute - 1d6sp | Lowly - 1d6gp | Poor - 1d6gp |
| 3-5 | Poor - 1d6gp | Lowly - 1d6gp | Poor - 1d6gp |
| 6-9 | Average - 2d6gp | Average - 2d6gp | Average - 2d6gp |
| 10-11 | Wealthy - 4d6gp | Highborne - 4d6gp | Comfortable - 4d6gp |
| 12 | Rich - 6d6gp | Highborne - 4d6gp | Wealthy - 6d6gp |

## Childhood Life Experience

Childhood events, memories, and influences shape a hero's adult life. Players are encouraged to create unique background elements relevant to their adventures. Remember it should not be too powerful.

More colour and depth can be added to the hero's background by rolling on tables related to their birth and life before the "call of adventure."

### Table 7.4.2 Unusual Life Experience

| 2 | You were anointed with cockatrice blood at birth and you are immune to petrification. |
| 3 | For reasons that are unclear, you can speak Draconic, the language of dragons. This does not mean they will be nice to you. |

| 4 | You spent time with a well known ranger who passed on a great store of knowledge; you have +1 to hunting and fishing skill tests, and pick one environment (not city) for which you gain +2 to your Region Lore (or if using the Survival skill gain +1 to that). |
| 5 | You 'ran' with a street gang and picked up some useful skills - you have +1 to your Sleight of Hand and Sneaking skill tests but you also have an enemy; at least one powerful person knows about your shady past. |

| 1 | You spent some time with a travelling circus strongman. You have got used to supplementing your diet with raw eggs and meat. You have bulging muscles and one point in the Strength special skill. |
| 2 | You spent some time apprenticed to a hedge witch, healer or physician and have a familiarity with wounds and disease. You have a point in the Healing special skill and can recognise common poisons and diseases without rolling. |
| 3 | At your naming ceremony you were given a blessing that stays with you for life. Once per adventure you can choose to automatically pass a Test for LUCK rather than roll it. You still reduce your LUCK by one after the 'test'. |
| 4 | Your grandparent was a well known hero who was renowned for their bravery. You have an almost supernatural resolve, and are unaffected by fear whether natural or magical. |
| 5 | You were anointed with Oil of Eagles by an old priestess as a baby, and as a result have outstanding vision. You gain +1 to all Awareness tests and can see further than most. |

| 2 | A childhood friend was an arsonist, and to this day it shapes your fears. You hate sleeping in a locked room with no easy escape, but on the other hand are able to get a flame going easily in almost any circumstances! |
| 3 | Your childhood was spent travelling by caravan, horse or ship. In addition to your many colourful memories you can also choose two more Languages which are known to level 2. |
| 4 | A chance meeting with a sailor, a friend from childhood, led to a three day drinking binge which you only survived due to a strange herbal drink your friend gave you. Since then, you are barely affected by alcohol. |
| 5 | Some years previously, you were accidentally caught in the middle of a magical duel, and the after effects have left you somewhat resilient to enchantment. You have a +1 bonus to LUCK tests taken to avoid magical effects. |
| 6 | As a child you had an enemy, a vicious bully, who loved nothing more than inflicting bruises and pain on you. As a result you became adept at hiding whenever his ugly face came into view. You have +1 in the Sneaking special skill. |
| **6** | Player choice or Special |

## Sworn Enemy

Titan is a world of constant conflict where families, clans, or nations might battle a particular foe. Having a sworn enemy gives you an "edge" when encountering them.

**Mechanical benefits:**
- +1 to combat rolls against your sworn enemy
- +1 to LUCK rolls when fighting them
- Start with 1 skill point in the relevant "Monster Lore" skill

### Table 7.4.3 Sworn Enemy

Titan is a troubled world and your people have been attacked in the past. Who have you sworn vengeance against?

| 1d6 | Sworn Enemy | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| **1-3** | | |
| 1 | Lizardmen | The lizardmen of Silur Cha may prefer the hot jungles as their abode, but whatever you are on Titan you run the risk of being attacked by them or their agents, always on the lookout for slaves or treasures. |
| 2 | Undead | An unfortunate aspect of life on Titan is the existence of the undead and their thirst for the life-force of the living is unending. |
| 3 | Demons | From the planes of hell come the demons and their mortal servants. They strive to come up with new ways to torment people with their cruelty. |
| 4 | Elementals | Whilst not always evil, creatures from the elemental planes are often powerful and indifferent to the damage they cause. It is best to send them back where they belong. |
| 5 | Evil Priests | The evil gods, led by Death, Disease & Decay, are always trying to cause ruin on Titan through their servants. You relish in hunting them down. |
| 6 | Orcs & Goblins | Made by Hashak the Creator, the orcs love to form into clans and tribes and live by raiding and stealing. They often bring along the cruel goblins to assist them. Beating back these creatures is doing everyone a favour. |
| **4-6** | | |
| 1 | Dragons | Although rare there are wild places where dragon attacks can be a brutal fact of life. The best policy is usually to run or hide from these powerful creatures, but some brave heroes are willing to take them on. |
| 2 | Giants | The first giants were created by Titan and some of them are still wise and good, but others have devolved into brutality and violence. They are powerful, but can be tricked. |
| 3 | Creatures of Chaos | The coming of chaos two and a half centuries ago changed the face of Titan leaving many places in ruins. Although the great army of chaos was defeated, the influence of this dangerous magic remains. |
| 4 | Dark Elves | A small number of elves have turned to the worship of Slangg and moved to live in magical underground cities. Cunning and cruel, it is a brave hero that takes on the Dark Elves. |
| 5 | Trolls & Ogres | The shock troops of the evil armies are the trolls and ogres. Strong but stupid, they can be beaten by a hero that is courageous and skilled. |
| 6 | Hero's Choice | Pick one of the categories above or create your own, based on your hero's backstory. |

## Personality Quirk

Everybody has some element to their personality which marks them out as different. You can come up with something that suits your particular background or roll on the table below to generate one.

These are intended to be parts of your character, not dominant features. A hero that is fastidious about their appearance does not have to pause in combat to wipe the gore from their armour, but they should stop and bathe as soon as the opportunity presents itself.

### Table 7.4.4 Personality Quirk

| 1d6 | Personality Quirk |
|-----|-------------------|
| **1-2** | |
| 1 | Phobia: You have a distinct fear of some kind, either a particular creature or situation. Decide on something appropriate and make a note of it. You will go to great lengths to avoid coming into contact with the source of your phobia. |
| 2 | You are noted for your generosity and you like to donate regularly to good causes, such as giving alms to the poor. The lowest in society (beggars, lepers and so on) are thankful for your kindness. |
| 3 | You are fastidious about your appearance, taking pride in your grooming and your clothing. |
| 4 | You hold the gods in high respect, even those opposed to you and take care not to offend them. |
| 5 | You are a gourmand, you love good food and fine wine and will seek them out. What exactly constitutes 'good' food is something your hero will have to decide for themselves - a barbarian might insist on huge piles of roasted meat, an elf might demand fresh fruit and spring water. |
| 6 | You have a great wanderlust and want to see as much of the world as you can. |
| **3-4** | |
| 1 | You hold the gods in contempt and see their worship as a sort of weakness (you may reroll this if your hero is a priest or paladin, or can build it into your story). |
| 2 | You are fascinated by history and ancient things, and you hope to build a collection one day. |
| 3 | You are fascinated by magic, grand or trivial, and you are always on the lookout for new items to examine. |
| 4 | You are embarrassed by displays of emotion and like to maintain a calm (some say icy) demeanour, particularly around strangers. |
| 5 | You have a love of natural, wild animals and try to avoid hurting or killing them unless absolutely required. |
| 6 | You are fascinated by power and those who wield it. You seek it in all its forms (force of arms, political, magical etc) and admire those who possess it. |
| **5-6** | |
| 1 | You are notably short-tempered and rude to those who disappoint you. You can bite your tongue if required, but you resent it when you have to. |
| 2 | You are honest to a fault and have trouble lying, even when telling the truth will cause problems. |
| 3 | You have a vivid imagination and love to embellish and add detail and colour to your conversation, even if that means lying. You struggle to give a simple, straight answer even when it is important. |
| 4 | You have an insatiable curiosity about the world and find it incredibly frustrating when you can't get an answer or explanation for something. |
| 5 | You love games and competitions and are always looking for ways to keep a 'score' of what's happening. You particularly dislike losing. |
| 6 | You are particularly merciful and believe in giving your enemies the chance for redemption if possible (this does not apply to creatures such as undead, demons, elementals and so as they operate according to an alien morality). |

## Summary

The most important thing is that you are happy with your hero and the details of their background and appearance. There is very little point in forcing yourself to play a character which does not suit you or is at odds with what you imagine your hero to be. If that happens, you should change the parts that are bothering you and roll or choose something that is more appropriate - the aim is to end up with a hero that is interesting and exciting to you, a hero that you want to see explore the world of Titan.
