# Birth Year

A twenty-year animal cycle exists on the world of Titan. Determine your campaign's year and then work backward to find the animal associated with your character's birth year.

**Animal Cycle (in order):** Dragon, Lion, Snake, Ox, Tiger, Goat, Mouse, Deer, Bat, Wolf, Eagle, Dog, Spider, Rabbit, Fox, Crocodile, Owl, Cat, Shark, and Horse.

Heroes gain a +2 bonus to Animal Lore and Animal Handling tests related to the animal of their birth year. For example, a hero born in the Year of the Mouse has an affinity with mice and other small rodents and gains a bonus when interacting with them.

The extent of this bonus is up to the Director. For instance, a hero born in the Year of The Bat might have a natural affinity with bats, leading to bats ignoring them in combat or even allowing communication.

**Exception:** The Year of the Dragon - as intelligent creatures, they have little interest in the birthday of its food!

**Historical Context:** The year on Titan described in the source books is 248 AC (248 After Chaos), which started from the year 1999 Old Time.
