# Birth Year

A twelve-year animal cycle exists in the real world, based on the Chinese zodiac. Determine your campaign's year and then work backward to find the animal associated with your character's birth year.

**Animal Cycle (in order):** Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.

Characters gain a +2 bonus to Animal Lore and Animal Handling tests related to the animal of their birth year. For example, a character born in the Year of the Rat has an affinity with rats and other small rodents and gains a bonus when interacting with them.

The extent of this bonus is up to the Director. For instance, a character born in the Year of the Dog might have a natural affinity with dogs, leading to dogs being more friendly and obedient to them.

**Exception:** The Year of the Dragon - as mythical creatures, they have little interest in the birthday of mortals!
