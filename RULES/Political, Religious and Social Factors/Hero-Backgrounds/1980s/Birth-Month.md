# Birth Month

In the 1980s, many people follow Western astrology and horoscopes. While birth month and zodiac sign don't determine personality, some people find that their sign's traits resonate with them, and in a world where the paranormal is real, these connections might be more meaningful than expected.

## Western Zodiac Signs

The Western zodiac is based on the position of the sun at the time of birth, divided into twelve signs corresponding to different periods of the year.
