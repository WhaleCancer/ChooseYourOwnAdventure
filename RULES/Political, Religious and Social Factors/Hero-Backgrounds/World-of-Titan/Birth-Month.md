# Birth Month

Throughout the year on Titan, the influence of the gods is felt. Birth month has no effect on the character of the person. Specifically, those born in the seventh month (when Glantanka "shows her face") are no more likely to be good than those born in other months.

## Calendars

There are two main calendars on Titan: Allansian and Khulian. These have been combined into one table, as the gods abide by their own schedules!
