# 7.2 Social Status and Rank

Everybody wants to get on in life, don't they? As well as the trappings of success such as houses, art, jewellery and so on there are acknowledged ranks that can be obtained to denote the social status of an individual.

Positions of status vary enormously from society to society and many of them overlap with other ranks and titles to some extent. A very simple tribal society might divide everyone into child, adult, elder, shaman whereas a huge empire could have hundreds of official and unofficial positions to occupy. Many armies have chaplains, trade princes are given a place in the nobility and so on. There is no absolute reason why a hero cannot rise in more than one category.

Because of the complexity this section is intended to provide a rough guide which players and the Director can apply to their adventures as they see fit - a way of getting the conversation started, not finishing it. These rules are expected to be guidance rather than 'hard' rules like those covering combat.

The advantage of having a system covering social status is that it provides a long term goal for the hero to achieve. Instead of being merely an adventurer seeking coin, they can plan on becoming a grand duke, bishop or folk hero. As usual it is best to discuss these plans with the Director.

This guide is intended to be used in addition to and in conjunction with other guidance given in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebooks, such as the Heroes Companion (Chapters 3 and 4 particularly) and the core rulebook sections covering prices and trade.

## Social Rank

There are variations between ancient societies but there are three things that most of them have in common. Firstly, most people are employed in industry (manual labour, farming, mining etc) with a small 'middle class' and very small upper class. Put simply, most people are peasants and moving up the ladder is hard. Secondly, most wealth is based on ownership of land or rights - merchants and professionals can gain wealth but very few compete with the incomes of the land owners. Thirdly, wealth is very unevenly distributed. Those at the top - the 5-10% - control most of the resources and those at the bottom have just enough to survive. This is a good motivation to become an adventurer - it's one of the few ways to change your wealth quickly!

In the Advanced Fighting Fantasy rulebook a simple table is given of social rank, going from 1 to 10, but with little explanation of how those values have been worked out and how a hero can go from one rank to the other. That does not mean it is unusable, but for the sake of this guide we have taken the basic concept and expanded it into something more rounded and complete. Heroes that do not wish to engage with the idea of Social Rank can use the simpler system in the main rulebook, but those who desire to explore the concept further can make use of this new set of rules.

In keeping with the usual AFF system we will provide a ranking from 2-12 though the precise ordering will depend on the setting you are using for your adventures. For example, in most settings the king is superior to a high priest but in a highly religious society that order could be reversed.

**Status talent:** A hero that takes the talent 'Status' upon creation has a Social Rank of 8. This means that they have, for some reason, acquired either a significant position in society or been born into a large amount of wealth - you should decide exactly why this has happened when you create that hero.

### Table 7.2.1 Social Ranks

| Social Rank | Representative Positions | Gold per annum Gross / Net* |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 2 | Beggar, Criminal, Slave, Torturer, Outlaw, Leper, Hag, Barbarian | 25 / 0 |
| 3 | Adventurer, Peasant, Soldier, Initiate, Pedlar, Watchman | 200 / 20 |
| 4 | Farmer, Minister, Student, Local Hero, Officer, Crafter, Squire, Sergeant | 300 / 50 |
| 5 | Captain, Clerk, Pride of the County, Researcher, Member, Trader, Witch | 500 / 100 |
| 6 | Artisan, Priest, Knight, Town Mayor, Champion, Lecturer, Master Craftsman | 700 / 200 |
| 7 | Baron, Colonel, Hero, Reader, Owner, Witchsniffer | 1,000 / 300 |
| 8 | Viscount, Bishop, Professor, Surgeon, Merchant | 2,000 / 500 |
| 9 | Earl, Count, Archbishop, General, Hero of Legend, Enforcer | 3,000 / 1,000 |
| 10 | Marquess, Cardinal, Genius | 5,000 / 2,000 |
| 11 | Prince or Duke, High Priest, Field Marshall, Hero of Myth, Master, Merchant Prince | 10,000 / 5,000 |
| 12 | Monarch, King, Emperor, Grand Master | 50,000 / 20,000 |

*Gold per annum, Gross / Net is a rough guide to how much gold a person of that rank might receive in a year and how much they could have once the costs of their lifestyle have been dealt with, assuming they manage it well. So a Knight receives 700gp from his land, but only has 200gp a year to spend on 'extras'. The descriptions of social roles provide more guidance and the campaign setting is also important. A knight in a kingdom ravaged by war, for example, might end up in debt at the end of the year due to the costs of buying horses, maintaining arms and armour and so on. Not all professions provide an income and there is no guarantee that reaching a certain rank will also mean gaining the wealth of their peers.

Holdings are described in detail in the Advanced Fighting Fantasy Heroes Companion. As a rough guide, a holding produces one twentieth and one tenth of its purchase value per annum as income. Thus to purchase the holdings needed for Social Rank 6 (700gp per annum income) would cost 7,000gp to 14,000gp, though of course such holdings are often gifted rather than bought. So an artisan might come into the possession of a set of workshops from a family member or patron and so on. It's up to you to decide if your heroes are given their income or have to purchase it. Requiring heroes to purchase their holdings, at least in part, is a great motivation for them to go on adventures!

## Uses of Social Rank

**Test your Rank:** If you are trying to decide if a hero or NPC can do something social, their rank can be used to take a test. So if a town mayor (rank 7) tries to raise a militia, you can roll 2d6 against that rank to see if it works - if they get a seven or less they have succeeded. Bonuses or penalties based on circumstances can apply (so if the mayor was trying to raise a militia as a horde of goblins approached, they would get a bonus. If they were trying to do it to carry out a personal vendetta against their wife's lover there would be a penalty).

**Modify Social Skills:** If two people of different rank meet, the difference can be used to provide a bonus or penalty to their social skill tests. So if a captain (rank 5) is talking to a peasant (rank 3) the captain would have a base +2 bonus to tests of etiquette, con, bargain and so on and the lower rank peasant would have a -2 penalty to the same skill tests. As usual, circumstances might justify other bonuses or penalties and the more stratified a society is could double or treble the effect to reflect the fact that 'everyone knows their place' (so a gap of one rank in social status causes +2 or -2 adjustment to the skill test).

**Determine Privileges:** If you are trying to decide who would have certain rights or access you can use social rank as a cut-off. For example, a city has a park which is maintained by the duke; only those of social rank 4 or higher are allowed in (no hoi polloi!). Within the park is a pleasure garden for those deemed worthy; only those of rank 6 or higher are invited inside. If a hero (rank 3) needs to get into the pleasure gardens, they will either have to sneak inside or find someone to go on their behalf.

**Test for promotion or demotion:** If you are trying to decide if a hero has done enough to move up a grade in their chosen career, you can roll 2d6. They need to roll at least equal to or higher than the current grade to progress. So a hero that is a priest (rank 6) has done some great deeds on behalf of the church and might be in line for promotion. They roll 2d6, scoring a 5 - it looks like they are stuck as a priest for the time being! If they had rolled 2d6 and got a total of 6 or more they would increase their social rank by 1. They would now be a priest (Social Rank 7) and would need to get promoted again to reach the rank of bishop (Social Rank 8).

Bonuses and penalties can be applied based on what the hero has done and the likelihood of their being a position available. For example, a hero that has fought bravely in a great battle in which several of his superiors were killed should have a significant bonus to their promotion roll.

A similar test can be used for demotion. If a hero has made some terrible mistakes or failures, they should roll 2d6 and compare it to their current rank. If the roll is equal or higher, they are demoted.

To continue the example above - our priest is tricked into allowing the head of a demonic cult to escape from prison. Oh dear. The church is not pleased and the Director decides the hero must check for demotion. They roll 2d6, scoring 5 - less than their current Social Rank of 7. The bishop shouts at them but doesn't punish them further. If they had rolled a 7 or more, the church would have decided to publicly blame them for the mistake and their Social Rank would have dropped from 7 to 6 - still a priest, but a humbler one.

What this means is that promotion gets harder the higher up you go, but so does demotion - the more powerful someone is in society, the more they can get away with!

**In game effects:** These are bonuses and advantages that come with your station in life. They are suggestions based on the broad categories and should be modified according to the specific nature of your 'calling'. For example, an elven ranger is following a military career but their benefits might be more related to riding, access to horses, knowledge of secret trails and so on. Customisation is recommended. Some categories provide an income - this should be justified by having the hero acquire lands or businesses, either by purchasing them or receiving them as gifts. The important point is that the money does not simply appear out of thin air.

## Descriptions of Social Status

Any large society will be extremely complex but advancement in social status can be divided into broad categories (with the obvious proviso that every society and campaign will have their own specific rules). The examples provided cover popular acclaim (folk heroes, politicians), religious organisation, academia, the military, the nobility, mercantile and other organisations (such as secret societies or private clubs). Obviously, an individual can rise in more than one area - a beloved priest may also be a folk hero and a wise sage could be a respected academic and also be ennobled for their work. This does not mean a hero should keep track of multiple Social Rank scores, unless they wish to. A single score is sufficient for most circumstances and heroes should choose one area to represent their exploits, or create their own unique set of advancements if none of the categories are suitable.

Monitoring social status is something that can be as complex as you like; the ideas in this section can be used as written or modified to include more detailed ideas such as conflict between factions in a society. If, for example, the nobility and the priesthood hate each other then their social ranks do not apply to those interactions.

Social ranks tend to bring duties, rewards, titles, incomes & expenses and expectations that should be modified so that they fit with your campaign. These ranks and titles are examples to be used as an inspiration.

## Other Options for Handling Social Rank

The system presented for earning and using social status with Advanced Fighting Fantasy is intended to be a more complete and rounded set of rules than those provided in the main rulebook, in which the concept of Social Rank is introduced but not fully elaborated on. There are of course many other ways in which status can be handled and it is up to you to decide how much time and effort you want to put into working out the status and occupation of your hero. Some other options include:

- **Handling social status in an abstract way** - you can ignore the numbering system and simply decide, based on the situation, how much respect your hero deserves and whether or not this translates into bonuses and penalties to use skills such as Etiquette, Bargain, Con and Leadership

- **Mixed / Limited status** - you can use the ranks provided in this section as a guide but only in a limited way. A hero might be hugely popular with their own people but also go around dressed and acting like a beggar. They would have two, entirely separate, social ranks.

- **Simplified Ranks** - rather than using a 2-12 system you can assign your heroes as belonging to low, moderate or high rank and apply a straight penalty of -3 when trying to interact with someone of higher status. This is faster but it is also less clear as to what your status actually means or how you change it.

Overall, this system is based on the types of hierarchies common in mediaeval fantasy settings in which powerful nobles, priests, warriors or wizards are accorded enormous respect and power and part of being a hero is ascending to those ranks. The way in which you handle this in your setting and campaign is up to you.

## Followers

As heroes rise in power and status, they may attract a follower - not just another NPC but one that is willing to follow the hero into danger and do as they say (within reason, they are not supposed to be mindless slaves). The follower should be created as if it was a hero, but one that is of lower 'rank'.

If you have it available, the Advanced Fighting Fantasy Heroes Companion provides rules for hirelings which can be used to create followers, or you can create one as if you were creating a new hero. In the AFF Rulebook a hero is created with 8 improvement points to adjust their characteristics (SKILL, STAMINA, LUCK, MAGIC). A follower should be created as a 'novice' with only 5 improvement points for characteristics and 6 points of special skills.

Followers do not have to be of the same 'type' as the hero though they should start off as someone that is following the same path. A wizard can have a fighter as a follower, a thief might attract a priest to their side (perhaps to try and mend their ways). It is up to you to create your follower and explain why they are attached to you.

You are not obliged to take a follower when one becomes available; if you prefer to play as a lone wolf you can simply ignore this option and leave it for another time.

**Releasing a follower:** You can, at any time, order your follower to leave your service and make their own way. If you wish them to come back into your service, you will have to find them and take a test of your leadership skill to convince them. If you are entitled to a follower (due to your social rank) another candidate will appear in 1d6 weeks; you are not obliged to accept them.

**Follower Experience:** If your follower accompanies on your adventures they gain experience but at a slower rate than you. For every four points of experience you gain, your followers get one.

**Example:** Jay 'Fingers' Finch has gained the respect of 'The Surly Boys', a criminal gang operating in and around Ludria. This is treated as a secret society and once Jay reaches the level of 'Enforcer' (Social Rank 9 within the gang) he finds that a young criminal has been so impressed with his antics that he wants to travel with Jay and learn from him. Jay creates a novice hero using the 5 improvement points to give him SKILL 5 STAMINA 12 LUCK 11 (he is human) and put our 6 skills points into combat and movement - 2 points in Sneaking and one each in Thrown, Climb, Awareness and Locks. We need to come up with a name for him (Kol 'Clubber' Tump) and provide him with some basic equipment. 'Clubber' Tump is willing to accompany Jay on his mission and act as muscle or a lookout, but what role he plays is up to Jay. He can take Clubber with him on his adventures, or tell him to stay at home and await instructions.

**Further customisation:** Those interested in creating followers and customising them may wish to refer to the Advanced Fighting Fantasy Heroes Companion, which has a chapter on hirelings and their abilities. Followers are not intended to be mercenaries - they have chosen to follow and assist the hero - but many of the rules and ideas that apply to hirelings can also be applied to followers.
