# Chapter 7 - Political, Religious and Social Factors

In this chapter we explore political, religious and social factors and lay out ways of establishing what they are for any particular settlement or region. We also provide some ideas and rules relating to the motivations and upbringing of your heroes. Those of you who are focused on the exploration and combat aspects of the game might see these as background issues but they do add depth and direction to both your heroes and villains.

## 7.1 Political Systems & Religion

Many people when creating a campaign or adventure will already have chosen a dominant political and religious system for their setting, as this can have a significant impact on motivations and consequences. In order to help those that are undecided, this system will generate broad political and religious systems that are dominant in your settlement or wilderness (they are generally not applicable to a dungeon!).

You can make the rolls for a kingdom or region as a whole, or have separate rolls for each settlement you encounter. Either way, remember to make a note of it and think about how it might impact your game.

These tables will give you some ideas to help flesh out the nature of your city, town or village. As with the maps, if you feel something is inappropriate or wrong for your campaign, then you should feel free to change it as you see fit.

Using these tables can result in some very contradictory results. For example, a settlement where the people are good, with strong controls, but still worship the gods of evil? It's up to you to interpret this - perhaps the settlement was recently conquered by a good lord, but he hasn't yet had time to clear the city of the evil temples and people still worship there. This sort of contradiction can be challenging to resolve but ultimately makes your world more interesting. To generate a broad view of the political situation, we determine the morality and level of control.

### Morality

Morality is a description of the general attitudes of the people towards their own behaviour and how they treat strangers, sometimes called alignment. No morality is universal. The kindest societies will still have their share of sociopaths and the most evil societies will still harbour those who secretly treat others with kindness.

**Good:** People believe in fairness, decency and compassion. The strong have a duty to help the weak and the community takes responsibility for its actions as a whole. Charity and helpfulness are common and strangers are treated with kindness.

**Neutral:** People believe that their decisions are a private concern and a matter for individual reflection. The community response to a situation is a matter of discussion and negotiation with the outcome depending on circumstances. Strangers are dealt with according to their behaviour.

**Evil:** People believe that their self interest trumps any wider concern and that the needs of the individual are paramount. Cruelty and violence are acceptable and 'might makes right' is the assumed basis for social behaviour. The strong should take advantage of the weak and strangers are exploited if possible.

### Level of Control

Control is a description of how ordered a society is and how closely its individual members are encouraged or forced to adhere to the norms. A strongly controlled society will behave in a uniform way; most people will behave according to the rules. A weakly controlled society will be argumentative and disjointed.

Control can be achieved by a number of methods, particularly in a fantasy setting where magic is possible, but in general you can assume that a strong level of control means there are regular patrols by militias and watchmen and that there is an organised law enforcement structure, whereas in a society with weak control it might be rare to come across someone who has official responsibility for keeping the peace.

**Weak:** Little enforcement of the rules of behaviour and little punishment for those that deviate from these. Law enforcement is sporadic and listless; the enforcers are treated with contempt and seen as low status, often open to bribery or deception.

**Effect:** If using the Lawbreaker rules add a +2 bonus to the result of the roll and the minimum result on Table 4.1.30 Lawbreaker is a 4, treat any roll lower than that as a 4.

**Moderate:** The law is enforced and aberrant behaviour is dealt with when it disrupts the peace or goes against the normal conduct. Law enforcement is considered to be a profession and the extent to which it is respected depends on the quality of the individuals that perform it. A bad constable will be ignored and a competent one will be treated with respect but not fear. The extent of the law is negotiable, often on the basis of the size of the bribe that can be offered.

**Strong:** The law is rigorously enforced by a well organised group of professional soldiers or militia that ensure any deviation from normal behaviour is punished according to the laws set down by the king, lord or tyrant that rules this place.

**Effect:** If you are using the Lawbreaker rules, deduct a -2 penalty to the result of the roll and the maximum result on Table 4.1.30 Lawbreaker is a 10, treat any rolls of 11 or 12 as having rolled 10. Patrols are frequent and well armed.

If required you can cross reference the local conditions with the results for the kingdom, empire or jurisdiction in which the settlement or location is situated.

### Table 7.1.1 Political System

Roll once to establish morality and again to determine level of control.

| 1d6 | Morality | Control: 1 (Weak) | Control: 2-5 (Moderate) | Control: 6 (Strong) |
|-----|----------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 1-2 | Good | People do their best but cannot guarantee safety; help must be sought from individuals. | People are pleasant but the will or resources to enforce that do not always exist. | Laws are just and widely enforced, they have the support of the general population. |
| 3-5 | Neutral | People do as they will and circumstances dictate outcomes. | Order is maintained with a light touch, mostly for the sake of trade and comfort. | An extensive system of laws is maintained that balance freedom and safety. |
| 6 | Evil | Might makes right, the strongest use force and fear to dominate without any curbs. | The population is hostile and many crimes are overlooked, particularly those committed by the wealthy. | Brutal control from the top down ensures that the weakest in society are mercilessly exploited. |

### Religion

A major component of morality in a society is the nature of the dominant religion. A city in which Libra, Goddess of Justice & Truth, is worshipped fervently is more likely to be 'good' with strong laws than a city in which Tanit, goddess of Envy and Jealousy, is held in highest regard. Of course, it can be very interesting to turn this on its head and try and work out why a 'good' settlement is worshipping an evil god.

On Titan the gods are divided into three categories, as described in the core rulebook. The gods of good, the neutral gods (including the beast lords) and the gods of evil.

When you reach a new settlement or region you should roll to see what the dominant religious view is. If you are building your Settlement starting with your map, you may have already decided which gods are worshipped here and why. In that case, use your judgement to determine what the religious climate of your settlement is; remember that there may still be hidden shrines and temples to other gods.

Temples and shrines may have more than one god as a patron, particularly in small settlements where they might only be able to afford the upkeep on a single site or building though obviously a general theme (good, neutral, evil) will dominate. So, for example, a small settlement might have a temple dedicated to Galana (Plants & Fertility) that also has shrines or smaller chapels dedicated to other gods such as Telak, Glantanka or Sindla.

Try to consider the nature and location of your settlement when deciding which gods are worshipped there. A city by a river might have a temple to Aqualis (Rivers) or Hydana (the Waters), a city which contains a college of magic might make space for a temple dedicated to Hamaskis (Learning). It should also be remembered that in a large settlement, such as a city, there is plenty of room for people to construct private chapels or hidden temples - their location and function is of course a source of adventure!

### Table 7.1.2 Religious Inclination of the Settlement or Region

| 2d6 | Morality: Good | Morality: Neutral | Morality: Evil | Religious Temperament | Effect |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| 2 | - | - | 2-7 | Evil: The Gods of Evil are worshipped here and fear and distrust are etched onto the faces of the populace. Might is right and you must rely on yourself for protection. | At a temple you have a -2 penalty to all Social skill rolls and you cannot ask to be healed unless you worship the gods of evil. |
| 3-5 | - | 4-8 | 8-10 | Neutral: The dominant religions are the neutral gods and the settlement tries to avoid conflict on either side of the argument. | None. |
| 6-11 | 6-11 | 9-10 | 11 | Good: This settlement tries to follow the path of justice and fairness. Efforts are made to uphold the law and punish criminals. People here are moralistic and judgemental of wrongdoing. | If you visit a temple, you may make a donation of 10gp to have 3 points of STAMINA damage restored, once per day. |
| 12 | 12 | 11-12 | 12 | Universal: Somehow, all the Gods are allowed here and a state of tolerance has been achieved. It is a strange state of affairs; philosophy is a common hobby here. | None. |

### Specific God

Many religious sites will be used by more than one group. If you need to find out which god specifically is the main deity for the shrine or temple, you can use the following table to do so.

A temple dedicated to a specific god will have priests and acolytes that have been initiated into the mysteries of that deity and therefore have access to some or all of the priestly powers detailed for that god. You can also expect that the temple will be decorated and themed appropriately. What exactly that means is up to you, but you are encouraged to exercise your imagination. A temple dedicated to Solinthar (Mariners) might be in the shape of a ship, or might actually be a ship floating out in a harbour. A temple dedicated to Arthallogen (spiders) could be in the shape of an enormous web, with the altar at its centre and surrounded by real webs containing spiders of all sizes.

Unless the temple is hidden or secret, you should pursue the idea that they will be highly decorated and extravagant in design, as the worshippers will be keen to demonstrate their devotion to the deity.

### Who is in Charge?

Ultimately there must be a person or group that holds power in your realm. We have not included any rules to decide who that is simply because it makes very little difference to how the game works (living under a good aligned king with strong control is basically the same as living under a good aligned council of merchants that also have strong control) but if your heroes are spending some time within a single realm, you might want to decide who is ruling it, so we will provide a list of examples for you to choose from.

- A king or queen, they derive power from tradition and support of the other nobles.
- A champion or folk hero, they derive power by support from the masses.
- A general or military leader, they derive power from control of the armies and navies.
- A high priest or group of priests, they control the church and are supported by believers.
- A scholar or sage they are leader by acclaim for their knowledge and abilities
- A secret group - this realm appears to be run in some normal way, but is in fact controlled from behind the scenes by a secret group.
- A council of merchants who control the realm by virtue of their wealth.
- A wizard or sorcerer who uses magic to control the populace.

These are not the only options. Perhaps your realm is ruled by a champion picked from the common folk by finding a fabled weapon? It might be hard to explain why that gives them a mandate, but this is a fantasy world and strange things can happen. You can make this decision at the start of your campaign or leave it until later, when you have worked out where your heroes will be spending their time.
