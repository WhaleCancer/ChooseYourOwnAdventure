# Star Fleet Rank

In 2285, Star Fleet remains the exploration, defense, and diplomatic arm of the United Federation of Planets, but the organization retains the frontier spirit and militaristic character of its earlier years. The Federation is still expanding into unknown space, and Star Fleet officers serve on the cutting edge of exploration aboard Constitution-class and other starships, space stations, and planetary outposts. The galaxy remains largely uncharted, and every mission into deep space carries the risk of encountering hostile powers like the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, or completely unknown threats.

Star Fleet in this era combines military discipline with scientific curiosity, but the emphasis is on rugged individualism, quick thinking, and the ability to make life-or-death decisions far from Federation support. Officers must be prepared to handle everything from first contact situations to combat engagements, from strange cosmic phenomena to diplomatic crises. The technology is advanced but not infallible—phasers can malfunction, transporters can fail, and ships can be damaged beyond repair. Officers learn to rely on their wits, their crew, and their training.

Promotion in Star Fleet is based on a combination of merit, leadership ability, technical expertise, and successful completion of missions—especially those that demonstrate the ability to handle the unexpected. Officers must prove themselves capable of independent action, as starships often operate far from command oversight. The most successful officers are those who can think on their feet, adapt to strange situations, and make the right call when the Prime Directive and survival conflict.

Star Fleet personnel in 2285 encounter the unknown constantly—strange phenomena, alien civilizations, temporal anomalies, cosmic mysteries, and hostile powers. Those who rise in rank have typically proven themselves in situations that would break lesser officers. Many senior officers carry the scars—physical, mental, or both—of encounters with the truly extraordinary. The frontier is dangerous, and Star Fleet officers are the ones who face that danger head-on.

**Typical Motivations for Star Fleet service are:** Exploration and discovery, defending the Federation, scientific curiosity, sense of duty, proving oneself, seeking adventure, serving a greater cause, family tradition, escaping a difficult past, seeking knowledge, diplomatic service, frontier spirit, desire to see what's out there, proving humanity's place in the galaxy, facing the unknown.

## Crewman, Ensign (Rank 3)

The lowest rank in Star Fleet, crewmen and ensigns are the backbone of any starship or station. They perform routine duties, follow orders, and learn their trade. Most are fresh from Star Fleet Academy or have transferred from other Federation services. In 2285, many crewmen are still adjusting to life aboard a starship—the constant hum of the engines, the artificial gravity, the view of stars streaking past at warp speed. They have little autonomy and must follow the chain of command, but they're the ones who keep the ship running day-to-day, whether that's maintaining the warp engines, operating the transporter, or standing watch on the bridge. **In game effect:** You are provided with a Star Fleet uniform (the classic colored tunic), phaser, communicator, and basic equipment. You have access to ship facilities (mess hall, recreation areas) and can request basic supplies. You may sleep in crew quarters when aboard a ship or station.

## Petty Officer, Chief Petty Officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade (Rank 4)

This rank encompasses both non-commissioned and junior commissioned officers who have proven their competence and are taking on greater responsibilities.

**Petty Officers and Chief Petty Officers** are non-commissioned officers who have proven their competence and reliability through years of service. Petty officers often have specialized technical skills and serve as department heads' right hands. They bridge the gap between enlisted crew and officers, and experienced chief petty officers often know more about their systems than the officers above them—they've seen the equipment break down, they know the workarounds, and they understand how things really work in the field. In the frontier environment of 2285, their practical experience is invaluable.

**Lieutenant Junior Grade** officers are junior commissioned officers who have completed their initial assignments and demonstrated basic competence. They're given more responsibility and may be assigned to lead small teams or manage specific ship systems. In 2285, many lieutenants junior grade are still learning their roles and may make mistakes, but they're on the path to greater things. They've likely been on at least one mission that didn't go according to plan, and they've learned that the unknown can be dangerous. They may be assigned to lead away teams to unexplored planets or manage critical ship operations during combat.

**In game effect:** As a petty officer or chief petty officer, you have learned to work efficiently and gain +1 to Technical skill tests related to your specialty (Engineering, Communications, etc.). You have access to technical manuals and can request specialized equipment for your duties. You know the tricks and workarounds that keep old systems running. As a lieutenant junior grade, you have gained basic command experience; gain +1 to your Leadership tests when directing subordinates. You may be assigned to lead away teams or manage specific ship operations. You've learned to trust your instincts when things go wrong.

## Lieutenant (Rank 5)

Experienced officers who have proven themselves capable of independent action. Lieutenants often serve as department heads (Chief Engineer, Chief Medical Officer, Chief of Security) or as bridge officers. In 2285, lieutenants have typically seen action—they've been in combat, dealt with strange phenomena, and made decisions that saved lives (or cost them). They're trusted to make decisions within their area of expertise and may be called upon to take command in emergency situations when senior officers are unavailable. Many lieutenants have stories of missions that went sideways and how they adapted. **In game effect:** Other officers respect you; when working with your department or specialty, you gain a bonus (Director's discretion) to relevant skill tests. You have access to ship's resources and may have junior officers or crew under your direct supervision. You've learned to improvise when standard procedures don't apply.

## Lieutenant Commander, Commander (Rank 6)

This rank encompasses two senior officer grades that represent experienced officers who have proven themselves capable of significant responsibility.

**Lieutenant Commanders** are senior officers who have demonstrated exceptional competence and leadership ability. They often serve as department heads on larger vessels or as second officers on smaller ships. They've proven themselves in multiple situations and are trusted with significant responsibilities. In 2285, lieutenant commanders have typically been through several major missions and have learned to handle the unexpected.

**Commanders** serve as first officers (executive officers) aboard starships, managing day-to-day operations and serving as the captain's right hand. In 2285, commanders are expected to be able to take command at a moment's notice and must be experts in multiple areas—they've typically served in multiple departments and understand how every system on the ship works. They're the ones who make the tough calls when the captain is unavailable, and they've learned to balance the Prime Directive with the safety of their crew. This is the default rank for Veteran characters, representing experienced officers who have proven themselves capable of significant responsibility but haven't yet achieved independent command.

**In game effect:** Other officers respect you; when working with your department or specialty, you gain a bonus (Director's discretion) to relevant skill tests. You have access to ship's resources and may have junior officers or crew under your direct supervision. You've learned to improvise when standard procedures don't apply. As a commander (first officer), you have significant authority and may be called upon to make critical decisions in the captain's absence. You can access classified information, coordinate ship operations, and have multiple officers reporting directly to you.

## Captain (Rank 7)

Captains command starships, space stations, or planetary facilities—they have ultimate responsibility for their vessel, crew, and mission. In the frontier environment of 2285, captains often operate far from Star Fleet Command, making decisions that will be reviewed months or years later. They've proven themselves capable of handling first contact situations, combat engagements, and strange phenomena. Many captains have stories of missions that tested their judgment and their crew's loyalty. This is the center point for the Status talent, representing officers who have achieved independent command and the ultimate responsibility that comes with it. Captains have proven themselves capable of making life-or-death decisions in the face of the unknown, and they bear the weight of those decisions. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank (a junior officer or experienced crewman), they must put their skill points into skills appropriate to Star Fleet service (Technical, Knowledge, Combat, or Movement skills). You have significant authority within your command and can access classified information, request resources, and make decisions that affect your ship or station. As a captain, you command a starship or facility and have final authority over all operations. You've learned to trust your judgment when facing the unknown, and your crew looks to you for leadership in the most dangerous situations.

## Commodore, Fleet Captain (Rank 8)

This rank encompasses two senior command positions that represent officers who have moved beyond single-ship command to coordinate multiple vessels or serve in critical strategic roles.

**Commodores** typically command multiple ships (a task force or squadron) or serve as station commanders at important facilities. In 2285, commodores coordinate operations across multiple vessels and have significant strategic responsibilities. Many are former starship captains who have been promoted to oversee larger operations, and they bring their frontier experience to strategic planning. They understand what it's like to be out there, making decisions far from support, and they use that knowledge to coordinate their task forces effectively.

**Fleet Captains** are experienced starship captains who have been given additional responsibilities, often serving as senior captains within a task force or commanding particularly important vessels. In 2285, fleet captains may coordinate groups of ships while still maintaining their own command, or they may command specialized vessels that require exceptional leadership. They've proven themselves capable of handling the most dangerous missions and are trusted with critical assignments that require both tactical skill and strategic thinking.

**In game effect:** When you are not adventuring and operating within Federation space, you gain access to resources from multiple ships or facilities under your command. You can coordinate operations across your task force and have access to strategic intelligence. You may have multiple officers reporting directly to you. You understand the realities of frontier operations and can plan accordingly. As a fleet captain, you may command a flagship or specialized vessel while coordinating other ships in your group.

## Rear Admiral (Rank 9)

Rear admirals serve in high-level command positions, overseeing sectors, coordinating fleet operations, or serving as advisors to Star Fleet Command. In 2285, rear admirals are involved in strategic planning and may be called upon to make decisions that affect entire regions of space. Many have decades of experience and have encountered numerous extraordinary situations during their time on the frontier. They understand the balance between exploration and defense, between the Prime Directive and survival, and they use that experience to guide Star Fleet policy. **In game effect:** You have significant influence within Star Fleet and the Federation. You can access classified intelligence, coordinate fleet movements, and may have knowledge of secret operations or classified technologies. You gain a follower of Novice rank (a staff officer or aide), they must put their skill points into Knowledge, Technical, or Leadership skills. You've seen enough of the unknown to know what Star Fleet is really up against.

## Vice Admiral (Rank 10)

Vice admirals serve in the highest echelons of Star Fleet Command, overseeing major operations, coordinating with Federation Council, and making decisions that affect the entire Federation. In 2285, vice admirals are often called upon to handle crises that threaten multiple worlds or require diplomatic solutions at the highest levels. They've typically spent decades on the frontier before moving to command positions, and they understand both the strategic picture and the realities of deep space operations. They balance the Federation's ideals with the harsh realities of the frontier. **In game effect:** When you visit a new Federation facility or world, you can contact Star Fleet personnel there and request assistance; what you are offered is at the Director's discretion but could include access to classified facilities, intelligence briefings, introduction to important Federation officials, or access to experimental technologies. You have extensive knowledge of Federation operations and may be aware of classified projects or secret missions. You understand the big picture and the details of frontier operations.

## Admiral, Fleet Admiral (Rank 11)

The highest ranks in Star Fleet, admirals and fleet admirals serve on Star Fleet Command and make decisions that shape Federation policy. In 2285, they coordinate responses to major threats, oversee exploration initiatives, and serve as the bridge between Star Fleet and the Federation Council. Fleet admirals are the ultimate authority within Star Fleet, answering only to the Federation Council and the President. These officers have typically spent their entire careers on the frontier, and they understand both the promise and the peril of deep space exploration. They've seen the unknown, faced hostile powers, and made decisions that shaped the Federation. In an era where the frontier is still expanding and threats are ever-present, their experience is invaluable. **In game effect:** You have ultimate authority within Star Fleet and can command fleets, authorize major operations, and access the most classified information. You can call upon Star Fleet resources across the Federation and may have knowledge of the most secret operations and technologies. Your decisions can affect entire sectors and you may be called upon to make choices that determine the fate of worlds. You've seen enough of the galaxy to know what the Federation is really facing out there.
