# Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)

In 1985 British Columbia, this category covers the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), which unified the Army, Navy, and Air Force in 1968. The CAF creates ranks and structures to maintain organization and ensure the chain of command functions. Promotion is supposed to be based on bravery, leadership, and competence, but often comes down to patronage, politics, and who you know.

The CAF structure is also applicable to private security contractors and paramilitary organizations operating in the shadows or working for government agencies, though these groups may use different rank structures.

In a setting where the paranormal is real but hidden, certain CAF personnel are more likely to encounter unexplained phenomena. **Test pilots** flying experimental aircraft at high altitudes or testing classified technology may witness objects that defy known physics, experience missing time, or encounter entities in the upper atmosphere. **Submarine crews** operating in the deep waters off BC's coast, particularly in areas where the continental shelf drops away, may encounter massive unidentified objects, experience strange sonar readings that don't match known marine life, or discover that their vessels have been tracked by something that shouldn't exist. These encounters are often classified, dismissed as equipment malfunctions, or buried in reports that never see the light of day.

**Typical Motivations for CAF work are:** Love of order, proving your valor, sense of duty, patriotism, desperation (no other options), forced enrollment (conscripted), loyalty to a cause or organization, pursuit of wealth (private security), family tradition, protecting the innocent, fighting the hidden threat.

## Private, Ordinary Seaman, Aircraftman (rank 3)

A private (Army), ordinary seaman (Navy), or aircraftman (Air Force). One of the rank and file. At this level, a person has limited choice about assignments. The hours are long, conditions can be difficult, and the pay, when it arrives, is barely enough to cover living expenses. Many spend their money on basic necessities, entertainment, and the rest they save or waste. **In game effect:** You are provided with a weapon and basic equipment (uniform, body armor, radio), which you are expected to look after. You may sleep and eat in the 'barracks' or base when in your home location.

## Corporal, Leading Seaman, Leading Aircraftman (rank 4)

A non-commissioned officer in charge of a small unit of personnel. Their main job is to make sure orders are carried out and to maintain discipline. NCOs get slightly better pay and conditions, but are still required to do as their superiors command and frequently have to purchase their own equipment. Overtime and side jobs are significant sources of income. **In game effect:** You have learned to be authoritative when required—gain +1 to your Con skill tests.

## Sergeant, Petty Officer (rank 5)

In charge of a number of units making up a platoon or section, and has some limited autonomy when it comes to giving orders. A sergeant will receive a decent income from the organization and will be provided with reasonable accommodation, but they will also be expected to maintain a certain level of lifestyle. With many personnel in the organization, excessive drinking, gambling, and entertaining can be common ways to go broke. **In game effect:** You have gained skill in command—you have +1 to your Leadership tests.

## Captain, Lieutenant (Navy), Flight Lieutenant (rank 6)

A junior officer with significant operational responsibilities. In the Army, a captain typically commands a company. In the Navy, a lieutenant might serve as a department head on a ship or submarine, responsible for navigation, engineering, or weapons systems. In the Air Force, a flight lieutenant or captain might serve as a test pilot, flying experimental aircraft and evaluating new systems. These officers receive decent pay and have more autonomy in their duties, but are still subject to the command of their superiors. Test pilots and submarine officers are among those most likely to encounter unexplained phenomena in the course of their duties. **In game effect:** You have access to specialized equipment related to your branch and role. If you are a test pilot or submarine officer, you gain +1 to relevant Technical skill tests related to your specialty. You may have encountered strange phenomena during operations that you're investigating—or trying to forget.

## Major, Lieutenant Commander (Navy), Squadron Leader (rank 7)

The lowest rank of the command structure, a major has the responsibility to act as liaison between high-level decision makers and commanders in the field. In the Navy, a lieutenant commander might serve as executive officer on a submarine or command a smaller vessel. In the Air Force, a squadron leader commands a squadron and may include test pilots who have encountered unexplained phenomena. Their ability to interpret those orders and how exactly they should be implemented makes the difference between a good and bad major. As a senior figure they receive a good level of pay, topped up with allowances and some 'redirection' of the budget. Officers at this rank often have access to classified information and may be aware of encounters with unexplained phenomena that are kept secret from the public and even from most military personnel. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a young officer eager to learn from you, they must put their skill points into Combat and Movement special skills. You have access to classified briefings and may have knowledge of paranormal encounters within your branch. If you are a test pilot or submarine officer, you may have direct experience with unexplained phenomena and access to restricted reports.

## Lieutenant Colonel, Commander (Navy), Wing Commander (rank 8)

A mid-level command officer responsible for larger units or specialized operations. A lieutenant colonel might command a battalion, while a commander in the Navy might captain a frigate or serve as executive officer on a larger vessel. A wing commander in the Air Force might lead a wing, including test pilot programs. These officers have significant autonomy and are trusted with important missions. They often have access to classified information about unexplained phenomena and may be responsible for managing cover-ups or investigations. **In game effect:** You have access to specialized resources and can request support from your branch. You gain +1 to Leadership tests when commanding your unit. You may have access to classified files on paranormal encounters and can authorize investigations or cover-ups.

## Colonel, Captain (Navy), Group Captain (rank 9)

A member of the command who has the job of interpreting intelligence and turning it into plans of action. They may or may not be in the field; the outcome of operations often depends on their ability to make the right call about deployments and tactics. In the Navy, a captain might command a destroyer or serve in a senior staff position. In the Air Force, a group captain might oversee test pilot programs or coordinate air operations. In addition to their pay, most colonels will also receive benefits, plus opportunities to demand favors from contractors or other organizations in return for assistance. On the downside, making the wrong call might well be career-ending or worse. Officers at this rank are often briefed on classified phenomena and may be involved in coordinating responses to unexplained events. **In game effect:** You gain access to a vehicle (car, truck, or other appropriate transport) and a position that provides you with 1d6 x $1,000 each year in additional income or benefits. In addition, you are provided with quality weapons and equipment. You have access to classified intelligence about paranormal encounters and can authorize special operations or investigations.

## Brigadier General, Commodore, Air Commodore (rank 10)

A major general advises the leadership about the overall strength of forces, ways to improve them, and the costs involved. They are often given additional positions for their service with the usual benefits to supplement their income, but the really big money comes from consulting, speaking fees, and post-retirement positions; a smart general will be on hand to pick up the best opportunities. On the downside, they can be held personally responsible for a failure and see their career, or their life, stripped from them. Officers at this rank are briefed on the highest levels of classified information, including comprehensive knowledge of paranormal encounters and government responses to unexplained phenomena. **In game effect:** Your position now provides 5d6 x $1,000 each year and you can call upon your organization's forces as you desire; however, your actions can lead to swift punishment if you upset the leadership of whichever organization you represent.
