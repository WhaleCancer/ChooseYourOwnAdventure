# Mercantile

In 1985 British Columbia, the pursuit of riches through business acumen is a common occupation and is respected, if not always loved, in most societies. There is no formal structure to advancement in this field—it's all about how much money you can accumulate. A hugely successful business owner with multiple locations would be higher in status than a struggling shopkeeper. Positions in this endeavor are measured in results, not titles.

**Typical Motivations for joining a Mercantile career are:** Pursuit of wealth and status, family inheritance, talent for business, desperation (escape from poverty), means to an end, competitive instinct, funding another aim, revenge (destroying another business), exploitation, building an empire.

## Working Class (Rank 3)

'Basic economic unit' may seem like an insult but it is a fair description. Working-class people make up the largest part of the population and do most of the actual work; their opportunities to escape poverty are limited. Unlike someone on welfare or unemployed, a working-class person has the right to earn money for themselves. A smart or lucky worker finds a way to move up the ladder through skill, persuasion, or sometimes dishonesty. **In game effect:** None. Good Luck!

## Skilled Worker (Rank 4)

Someone who has established a skill at a particular trade, e.g. electrician, plumber, mechanic, etc. No longer expected to carry out unskilled work, a skilled worker (often having completed an apprenticeship) has taken the first step toward some form of wealth. Frequently, taking up a trade involves joining a union that regulates and controls it. **In game effect:** Pick a Technical or Crafting special skill and gain one point in it. You can earn 1d6 x $100 a week from your skills, provided you have access to tools and can find work.

## Small Business Owner (Rank 5)

There are only so many hours in the day, so in order to become wealthy a person needs to learn to run a business; effectively making a profit from the work of others or from providing services. A small business owner has set up a business and spends time managing it and establishing links with suppliers and customers. As with a skilled worker, this will probably have to be done with the approval of relevant licensing bodies or unions that manage the trade. **In game effect:** You spend a lot of time haggling and negotiating; gain +1 to your Bargain skill rolls. Your business brings in 2d6 x $100 per week if you devote your time to it.

## Business Owner (Rank 7)

A business that grows eventually needs premises, equipment, and employees, with the owner at the top directing operations and reaping the profits. With the money coming in, a business owner starts to get more attention from other parts of society, usually looking for a handout or partnership! **In game effect:** If you acquire a premises (shop, office, or workshop), your business will now provide you with 1d6 x $100 per week in profit, or 3d6 x $100 per week if you devote your time to it.

## Merchant, Business Executive (Rank 8)

A truly successful owner will continue to expand their operations; multiple locations, varied product lines, a wider customer base, warehouses, and maybe transportation. A business becomes a widely known enterprise, with activity in more than one location and money flowing through it like lifeblood. A merchant may not be 'elite' but they will certainly find the higher-ups in society treating them with respect. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a person whose interests align with your business. They must put their skill points into special skills that are appropriate to your 'interests'. Your business has now grown to cover several locations and brings in 4d6 x $100 per week in profit if you make a Bargain skill test, or 2d6 x $100 if you fail the test.

## Business Magnate (Rank 11)

The pinnacle of economic success, a business magnate has accumulated vast wealth. With their fingers in a number of economic pies, they will be owners of one or more significant businesses and have control of a significant market or industry. Control over a transportation route, ownership of a chain of businesses, control over a resource or service within a region would all be examples of what it takes to become a business magnate. With this level of wealth comes enormous power in other areas, and there will be a long line of people seeking them out for help and assistance. The trappings of a business magnate will be very similar to those of the highest corporate elite, and many seek out opportunities to flaunt their riches. **In game effect:** Your business has now grown into a web of interests and activities that creates a constant stream of problems to solve. You gain one skill point in two of City Lore, Bargain, Law, or Languages as you try to cope. It brings in 2d6 x $1,000 per week in profit if you make a Bargain skill test, or 1d6 x $1,000 if you fail the test. Dealing with others grants you one point in either the Law or Languages skills.
