# Royal Canadian Mounted Police

In 1985 British Columbia, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) serves as both federal and provincial police force. As the provincial police, the RCMP provides policing services to most municipalities and rural areas across British Columbia, with the exception of a few major cities that maintain their own municipal police forces. The RCMP creates ranks and structures to maintain organization and ensure the chain of command functions. Promotion is supposed to be based on competence, leadership, and investigative skills, but often comes down to patronage, politics, and who you know.

The RCMP structure is hierarchical, with clear distinctions between constables, non-commissioned officers, and commissioned officers. In 1985, the RCMP is dealing with organized crime, drug trafficking, and increasingly, cases that touch on the paranormal—though most officers don't know the full extent of what they're dealing with.

**Other Police Forces in British Columbia:** While the RCMP serves as the provincial police force, several major cities maintain their own municipal police departments. The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) is the largest municipal force, responsible for policing Canada's third-largest city. The Victoria Police Department serves the provincial capital, while smaller forces like the New Westminster Police Department and Delta Police Department operate in their respective municipalities. These municipal forces have their own command structures, budgets, and operational procedures, though they coordinate with the RCMP on major investigations and share information through formal channels.

**Suspicions of Compromise:** Within the RCMP, there is growing suspicion—particularly among higher-ranking officers and those investigating organized crime—that some municipal police forces may be compromised. These suspicions are rarely spoken of openly, but they manifest in several ways: cases that mysteriously stall when information is shared with municipal forces, officers who seem to have advance warning of RCMP operations, evidence that disappears or is mishandled by municipal police, and patterns of corruption that suggest organized crime has infiltrated certain departments. The RCMP maintains formal cooperation with municipal forces, but many RCMP officers have learned to be cautious about what information they share and which municipal officers they trust. Some RCMP investigators maintain private files on municipal police officers they suspect of corruption or connections to criminal organizations. These suspicions are particularly strong regarding forces operating in areas with heavy organized crime presence, such as Vancouver, where the VPD must deal with biker gangs, triads, cartels, and other criminal organizations that have the resources and motivation to corrupt law enforcement.

**Women in the RCMP:** Women were first accepted as regular members in 1974, and by 1985 they are still relatively new to the force. While officially accepted, many face discrimination, harassment, and skepticism from colleagues and the public. Women are often assigned to "softer" duties or face pressure to prove themselves in ways male officers don't. Despite these challenges, some women have risen through the ranks and proven themselves capable investigators. Women officers may face additional scrutiny when reporting strange phenomena, as their accounts may be dismissed more readily than those of male officers.

**Non-White Officers:** In 1985, the RCMP is still predominantly white, though efforts to recruit visible minorities have begun. Non-white officers, particularly those of Asian, South Asian, or First Nations descent, face discrimination and may be assigned to communities where their ethnicity is seen as an asset (e.g., Asian officers to Chinatown, First Nations officers to reserves). They often face a "double burden" of proving themselves both as officers and as members of their communities. Non-white officers may have unique insights into paranormal phenomena through their cultural backgrounds, but their reports may be taken less seriously by white superiors.

**Paranormal Encounters:** RCMP officers at all ranks may encounter unexplained phenomena, though how they experience it varies by rank and assignment. Constables on rural patrols may respond to calls about strange lights, missing persons in remote areas, or reports of cryptids. Urban officers may investigate cases involving unexplained deaths, mass hysteria, or strange occurrences that don't fit normal patterns. Higher-ranking officers may see patterns across multiple cases, coordinate responses to unexplained events, or have access to classified information about paranormal phenomena.

**Typical Motivations for RCMP work are:** Sense of duty, protecting the innocent, fighting crime, proving your competence, family tradition, pursuit of justice, loyalty to the organization, fighting the hidden threat, uncovering the truth.

## Constable (rank 3)

A basic constable, one of the rank and file. At this level, a person has limited choice about assignments and is often sent where needed. The hours are long, conditions can be difficult, and the pay, when it arrives, is barely enough to cover living expenses. Many spend their money on basic necessities, entertainment, and the rest they save or waste. Constables on rural patrols or responding to calls in remote areas are often the first to encounter unexplained phenomena—strange lights in the sky, reports of cryptids, missing persons cases that don't add up, or encounters with entities that shouldn't exist. Many dismiss these as hoaxes, hallucinations, or misidentifications, but some constables begin to notice patterns. **In game effect:** You are provided with a weapon and basic equipment (uniform, body armor, radio, handcuffs), which you are expected to look after. You may sleep and eat at the detachment when in your home location. You may have encountered strange phenomena during patrols or investigations that you're trying to understand—or trying to forget.

## Corporal (rank 4)

A non-commissioned officer in charge of a small unit of constables or responsible for specific duties. Their main job is to make sure orders are carried out and to maintain discipline. Corporals get slightly better pay and conditions, but are still required to do as their superiors command and frequently have to purchase their own equipment. Overtime and side jobs are significant sources of income. Corporals may supervise constables who report strange phenomena, and may begin to notice patterns or connections between seemingly unrelated cases. They may be tasked with investigating reports that don't fit normal categories. **In game effect:** You have learned to be authoritative when required—gain +1 to your Con skill tests. You may have access to case files that show patterns of unexplained phenomena, and can coordinate responses to strange occurrences.

## Sergeant (rank 5)

In charge of a number of units making up a section or responsible for a specific area of operations, and has some limited autonomy when it comes to giving orders. A sergeant will receive a decent income from the organization and will be provided with reasonable accommodation, but they will also be expected to maintain a certain level of lifestyle. With many personnel in the organization, excessive drinking, gambling, and entertaining can be common ways to go broke. Sergeants often review case files and may notice patterns of unexplained phenomena across multiple investigations. They may be responsible for deciding which cases get proper investigation and which get filed away as "unresolved" or "insufficient evidence." Some sergeants maintain private files on strange cases. **In game effect:** You have gained skill in command—you have +1 to your Leadership tests. You have access to case files and may have noticed patterns of unexplained phenomena. You can authorize investigations or decide to bury cases that don't fit normal explanations.

## Staff Sergeant (rank 6)

A senior non-commissioned officer responsible for overseeing multiple sergeants and their units, or managing specialized operations. Staff sergeants have significant operational experience and are trusted with complex investigations and coordination of multiple units. They receive better pay and have more autonomy than lower ranks, but are still subject to the command of commissioned officers. Staff sergeants often review case files from multiple sergeants and may be the first to notice patterns of unexplained phenomena across different areas or time periods. They may be assigned to investigate cases that don't fit normal patterns or coordinate responses to unusual events. Some staff sergeants maintain detailed files on strange cases and may begin to understand that something larger is happening. **In game effect:** You have access to case files from multiple units and can coordinate investigations across different areas. You gain +1 to Investigation tests when reviewing case files or looking for patterns. You may have noticed connections between seemingly unrelated strange cases.

## Inspector (rank 7)

The lowest rank of the command structure, an inspector has the responsibility to act as liaison between high-level decision makers and officers in the field. Their ability to interpret those orders and how exactly they should be implemented makes the difference between a good and bad inspector. As a senior figure they receive a good level of pay, topped up with overtime and some 'redirection' of the budget. Inspectors often see the bigger picture across multiple cases and may coordinate responses to unexplained phenomena. They may be briefed on classified information about paranormal encounters and may be responsible for managing cover-ups or coordinating with other agencies. Some inspectors are aware of programs like Project Greycoast or other classified investigations. This rank represents the center point for the Status talent—inspectors have achieved significant standing within the RCMP and have access to resources and information that lower ranks do not. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a young constable eager to learn from you, they must put their skill points into Combat, Investigation, and Movement special skills. You have access to classified briefings and may have knowledge of paranormal encounters within the RCMP. You can authorize special investigations or coordinate with other agencies investigating unexplained phenomena. You have achieved the Status talent center point and have significant standing within the organization.

## Superintendent (rank 8)

A member of the command who has the job of interpreting intelligence and turning it into plans of action. They may or may not be in the field; the outcome of operations often depends on their ability to make the right call about deployments and tactics. In addition to their pay, most superintendents will also receive benefits, plus opportunities to demand favors from other organizations in return for assistance. On the downside, making the wrong call might well be career-ending or worse. Superintendents have access to classified intelligence about unexplained phenomena and may coordinate responses to paranormal events. They may be involved in managing cover-ups, coordinating with government agencies, or overseeing special investigations. Some superintendents are fully briefed on programs investigating the paranormal and may coordinate with organizations like M-EPIC. **In game effect:** You have access to specialized resources and can request support from multiple units. You gain +1 to Leadership tests when coordinating operations. You have comprehensive knowledge of paranormal encounters within your jurisdiction and can coordinate with other agencies investigating unexplained phenomena.

## Chief Superintendent (rank 9)

A senior member of the command structure responsible for overseeing multiple divisions or specialized operations. Chief superintendents have significant influence and are trusted with the most sensitive investigations. They receive excellent pay and benefits, and have access to resources that lower ranks do not. Chief superintendents often review intelligence from multiple superintendents and may coordinate responses to unexplained phenomena across entire regions. They may be involved in making policy decisions about how to handle paranormal encounters and may coordinate directly with government officials or other agencies. Some chief superintendents are fully briefed on classified programs investigating the paranormal and may serve as liaisons with organizations like M-EPIC or other government agencies. **In game effect:** You gain access to a vehicle (police car or other appropriate transport) and a position that provides you with 1d6 x $1,000 each year in additional income or benefits. In addition, you are provided with quality weapons and equipment, and have access to specialized resources. You have comprehensive knowledge of paranormal encounters across your region and can coordinate with other agencies investigating unexplained phenomena. You can authorize major investigations or cover-ups.

## Assistant Commissioner (rank 10)

A very senior member of the command structure, responsible for overseeing entire divisions or serving in high-level staff positions. Assistant commissioners have significant influence and access to the highest levels of classified information. They receive excellent pay and benefits, and have access to resources across the entire RCMP organization. Assistant commissioners often coordinate responses to unexplained phenomena across multiple regions and may be involved in making policy decisions about how to handle paranormal encounters at the national level. They may coordinate directly with the Prime Minister's office or other top-level government agencies. Some assistant commissioners are fully briefed on all classified programs investigating the paranormal and may serve as liaisons with international allies or other government agencies. **In game effect:** You have access to classified intelligence from across the RCMP and can request resources from multiple divisions. You gain +1 to Investigation tests when researching classified matters. You have comprehensive knowledge of paranormal encounters across all RCMP operations and can coordinate with organizations like M-EPIC or other government agencies investigating unexplained phenomena. Your position provides you with 2d6 x $1,000 each year in additional income or benefits.

## Commissioner (rank 11)

Responsible for the entire RCMP organization in a region or for specific operations, reports directly to the heads of the organization (usually government officials) and rarely attends the front lines. A commissioner advises the leadership about the overall strength of forces, ways to improve them, and the costs involved. They are often given additional positions for their service with the usual benefits to supplement their income, but the really big money comes from consulting, speaking fees, and post-retirement positions; a smart commissioner will be on hand to pick up the best opportunities. On the downside, they can be held personally responsible for a failure and see their career, or their life, stripped from them. Commissioners are fully briefed on all classified paranormal phenomena and government responses. They may coordinate directly with the Prime Minister's office or other top-level government agencies on unexplained events. They have authority to authorize or shut down investigations and may be involved in making policy decisions about how to handle paranormal encounters. **In game effect:** Your position now provides 5d6 x $1,000 each year and you can call upon your organization's forces as you desire; however, your actions can lead to swift punishment if you upset the leadership of whichever organization you represent. You have comprehensive knowledge of all classified paranormal encounters and government responses, and may coordinate with international allies on unexplained phenomena.
