# Coast Salish First Nations

In 1985 British Columbia, the Coast Salish First Nations include the Squamish, Musqueam, Tsleil-Waututh (Burrard), Lekwungen, Saanich, and other related peoples who have lived along the coast and in the Lower Mainland for thousands of years. Coast Salish communities maintain traditional governance structures alongside modern band councils, with hereditary chiefs, elders, and knowledge-keepers holding significant authority. In 1985, Coast Salish people navigate between traditional ways and modern Canadian society, facing ongoing challenges of land rights, cultural preservation, and encounters with unexplained phenomena that echo through the Old Stories.

The Coast Salish social structure blends traditional roles with modern positions. Traditional roles include community members, knowledge-keepers, medicine people, hereditary chiefs, and elders. Modern positions include band council members, activists, lawyers, and those working in education, healthcare, or government. Advancement comes through demonstrating wisdom, protecting the community, preserving traditional knowledge, and showing leadership in both traditional and modern contexts.

**Traditional Knowledge and Paranormal Encounters:** Coast Salish people have long-standing knowledge of places where the veil between worlds is thin, entities that come from the sky or through holes in the world, and phenomena that others dismiss as myth. The Old Stories speak of Star People, Thunderbird, Tricksters, and "Things that Come Through Holes in the World"—knowledge that has practical application when dealing with unexplained phenomena. Many Coast Salish people, especially knowledge-keepers and medicine people, can sense or see supernatural threats more clearly than others, describing Greys as "hollow masks" and Elohim as "Hungry Shadows" or "False Spirits." Traditional rituals, smudging, drumming, songs, and sacred objects can provide protection against nonhuman entities.

**The Circle of Watchers:** Many Coast Salish knowledge-keepers, hereditary chiefs, medicine people, and activists are part of the Circle of Watchers, an informal alliance that confronts threats affecting all First Nations land. The Circle uses both traditional knowledge and modern tools (CB radios, pickup trucks, legal activism) to protect sacred sites, track missing persons, and resist corporate or government incursions into thin veil areas.

**Typical Motivations for Coast Salish community involvement are:** Protecting the land and people, preserving traditional knowledge, defending sovereignty, serving the community, honoring ancestors, protecting sacred sites, fighting against exploitation, bridging traditional and modern worlds, confronting supernatural threats.
