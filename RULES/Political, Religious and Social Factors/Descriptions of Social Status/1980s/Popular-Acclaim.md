# Popular Acclaim

In 1985 British Columbia, popular acclaim comes through media attention, community organizing, political activism, environmental advocacy, labor organizing, feminist activism, or acts of heroism that capture public imagination. This path relies on visibility and public support rather than wealth or institutional backing. Those who rise through popular acclaim can gain significant influence, but public opinion is fickle—one scandal or misstep can destroy a reputation overnight. Someone pursuing this path should identify their base—working-class communities, environmental activists, First Nations communities, political party members, labor unions, feminist organizations, or any marginalized group seeking representation.

The political landscape in 1985 BC is dominated by the **Social Credit Party** (the governing party, center-right and conservative) and the **New Democratic Party (NDP)** (the main opposition, center-left and social democratic). Smaller parties like the Progressive Conservative Party and Liberal Party also exist but have less influence. Political activists may rise through party ranks, organize campaigns, or become known for their advocacy on specific issues.

**Labor Organizing:** British Columbia has a strong labor tradition, and in 1985 labor organizers are active in industries including forestry, mining, manufacturing, transportation, and public services. Union organizers may lead strikes, negotiate contracts, organize workers, or fight for workplace safety and rights. Labor activists may gain acclaim through successful strikes, organizing campaigns, or defending workers' rights against corporate exploitation. Some labor organizers may encounter unexplained phenomena when organizing in remote areas or investigating workplace safety issues that touch on the paranormal.

**Feminist Activism:** The women's movement is active in 1985 BC, with feminists organizing around issues including reproductive rights, workplace equality, violence against women, and political representation. Feminist activists may organize protests, run women's centers, provide support services, or advocate for policy changes. They may gain acclaim through successful campaigns, media attention, or direct action that captures public imagination. Some feminist activists may encounter unexplained phenomena when investigating cases involving missing or exploited women, or when their work brings them into contact with organizations or individuals connected to the paranormal.

**Other Activists:** 1985 BC sees activism around various social justice issues including anti-racism, LGBTQ rights, disability rights, anti-poverty work, and peace activism. Activists may organize protests, provide support services, advocate for policy changes, or engage in direct action. They may gain acclaim through successful campaigns, media attention, or organizing efforts that mobilize communities.

Environmental activism is a major force in 1985 BC, with the **Cascadia Wilderness Association (CWA)** being one of the most prominent and radical environmental organizations. The CWA, known as "The Cascadians" or "The Guardians," combines public environmental advocacy with direct action, intelligence gathering, and protection of wilderness areas. While their public face promotes environmental research and wilderness advocacy, they also engage in more radical activities including trespassing, sabotage, and data theft to expose corporate environmental violations and protect areas affected by unexplained phenomena. CWA activists may gain acclaim through successful campaigns, media attention, or direct action that captures public imagination.

**Typical Motivations for pursuing popular acclaim are:** Seeking fame, defending your community, fighting against injustice, environmental activism, political change, media attention, protecting the vulnerable, exposing corruption, protecting wilderness areas, fighting corporate exploitation, advancing party goals, organizing workers, fighting for women's rights, social justice, labor rights, workplace safety.
