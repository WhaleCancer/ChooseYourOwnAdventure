# Roman Catholic Church

In 1985 British Columbia, the Roman Catholic Church maintains a hierarchical structure from the Pope in Rome down through Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and Parish Priests to the laity. The Church has a long tradition of dealing with the supernatural through exorcism, demonology, and investigation of paranormal phenomena. Some branches, orders, and Vatican departments maintain knowledge of unexplained events and supernatural threats.

Rising from a lay person to a leader can be slow, and formal positions often require carrying out religious duties (running services, counseling, community outreach, administrative work) which may limit adventuring. However, the Church may reward clergy for extreme acts of service, provided they support the teachings. At the lowest level, religious work involves maintaining facilities, preaching, and collecting donations. High-ranking members may have significant income, but it's expected to be spent in service of the faith—charitable works, building maintenance, commissioning art, or supporting the community.

The Church hierarchy is structured: Pope → Cardinals → Archbishops → Bishops → Monsignors/Vicars General → Parish Priests → Deacons/Seminarians → Religious Brothers/Sisters → Laity. Some specialized roles exist outside this structure, such as exorcists who may be priests trained in dealing with supernatural threats.

**Role of Women in the Catholic Church:** In 1985, the Catholic Church maintains a strict policy that only men can be ordained as priests. However, women play significant roles within the Church. Religious sisters (nuns) serve in religious orders, running schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. Some women serve as lay ministers, running parish programs, teaching religious education, or working in administrative roles within dioceses. Women may also serve as members of lay organizations, such as the Catholic Women's League, which provides significant support to parishes and charitable works. While women cannot hold ordained positions, some have achieved significant influence through their work in religious orders, lay organizations, or administrative roles. Women who encounter paranormal phenomena may find their reports taken less seriously by male clergy, though some religious sisters and lay women have developed expertise in areas such as counseling, social work, or investigation that brings them into contact with unexplained events.

**Typical Motivations for Catholic religious work are:** Worshipping God, defending the faith and followers, battling against evil and secularism, pursuing a calling or vision, moral and philosophical convictions, seeking community and belonging, protecting the innocent from supernatural threats.

## Catechumen or Inquirer (rank 3)

You have comprehensive knowledge of all classified paranormal encounters and Vatican responses, and may coordinate with international allies on unexplained phenomena.

## Catholic Orders and Paranormal Knowledge

The Catholic Church has a long tradition of dealing with the supernatural, and some branches maintain knowledge of paranormal phenomena:

**Exorcists:** Priests trained and authorized by their bishop to perform exorcisms. In 1985, exorcists may encounter real cases of possession, demonic influence, or other supernatural threats. They often work quietly, as the Church is cautious about publicizing such matters.

**Jesuit Order (Society of Jesus):** Known for scholarship and education, some Jesuits may research unexplained phenomena, investigate paranormal events, or maintain archives of strange occurrences. Their intellectual tradition makes them natural investigators.

**Opus Dei:** A secretive personal prelature within the Church. Some members may have knowledge of supernatural threats or work to combat them through prayer, sacrifice, and action. Their emphasis on sanctification through daily work could extend to fighting hidden evils.

**Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF):** The Vatican department formerly known as the Inquisition. While officially focused on doctrine, some within the CDF may investigate phenomena that challenge Church teachings or represent genuine supernatural threats. They maintain extensive archives and have authority to investigate matters of faith and morals.

**Local Diocesan Offices:** Some dioceses may maintain unofficial files on strange occurrences, particularly those involving Catholic sites, artifacts, or individuals. Bishops may quietly assign priests to investigate or contain such matters.

**Religious Orders:** Various orders (Dominicans, Franciscans, Benedictines) may have members who encounter or study paranormal phenomena, often through their work in education, healthcare, or ministry in remote areas where strange events occur. Religious sisters may encounter unexplained phenomena through their work in hospitals, schools, or social services, though their reports may be taken less seriously than those of male clergy.
