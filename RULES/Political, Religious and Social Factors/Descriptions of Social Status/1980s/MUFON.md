# MUFON (Mutual UFO Network)

In 1985 British Columbia, MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) is a civilian, non-profit organization dedicated to the scientific study of UFOs and related phenomena. Unlike government agencies like M-EPIC or religious UFO cults, MUFON presents itself as a legitimate scientific research organization, using systematic investigation methods, field research, and documentation to study UFO sightings. The British Columbia chapter is relatively small but active, with members scattered across the province who coordinate through monthly meetings, newsletters, and field investigation teams.

MUFON members rise through the organization by demonstrating competence, contributing to investigations, following scientific protocols, and building a reputation for reliable research. Advancement comes through taking on more responsibility, leading investigations, training new members, or contributing specialized expertise. Unlike other organizations, MUFON social rank only matters within the organization or to those who recognize it—outsiders may view MUFON members as eccentric hobbyists or serious researchers depending on their perspective.

**Paranormal Encounters:** MUFON investigators may encounter genuine UFO activity, alien technology, Greys, Elohim, or other supernatural phenomena in the course of their work. Field investigators responding to sighting reports may discover physical evidence, witness strange phenomena, or encounter entities that others dismiss as myth. Some investigators may experience missing time, strange dreams, or other effects of contact. Higher-ranking members may coordinate responses to major cases, maintain databases of unexplained phenomena, or have access to classified information through government contacts or infiltration.

**Infiltration and Manipulation:** MUFON has been infiltrated by various groups—M-EPIC agents working undercover, government informants, cult members seeking information, or conspiracy organizations using MUFON as cover. Some investigations may be deliberately steered away from sensitive information, or investigators may be fed false information. Investigators who get too close to the truth may face threats, disappearances, or "accidents."

**Typical Motivations for MUFON work are:** Scientific curiosity, desire to understand unexplained phenomena, proving the existence of UFOs, exposing government cover-ups, helping witnesses, contributing to research, finding answers, community and belonging, fighting the hidden threat, uncovering the truth.
