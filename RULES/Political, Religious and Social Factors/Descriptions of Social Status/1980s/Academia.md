# Academia

In 1985 British Columbia, academia centers around the province's major universities: the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Burnaby, the University of Victoria (UVic) on Vancouver Island, and smaller institutions like the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) and various community colleges. Academia also includes researchers at government facilities, think tank analysts, and independent scholars investigating the paranormal, conspiracy theories, or classified subjects.

Academics rise in their field through brilliant displays of intellect or by accumulating rare and valuable knowledge. They don't always end up with riches—many spend all their money on rare books, strange devices, or research materials—but a few find ways to turn discoveries into wealth or secure government funding.

Academics may work or consult for various organizations with no specific loyalty—government agencies, Indigenous bands, corporations, or other institutions may all seek academic expertise. A biologist might consult for a mining corporation on environmental impact, then work for a First Nations band on land rights, then consult for the government on policy. An anthropologist might work for a corporation studying consumer behavior, then consult for an Indigenous band on cultural preservation, then work for the government on treaty negotiations. A sociologist might study rural communities for a corporation, then consult for the government on social programs, then work for an Indigenous band on community development. Motivations vary—some academics are driven by money, others by intellectual curiosity, some by a desire to help communities, others by a need for access to resources or information. This lack of specific loyalty means academics can move between different employers and may have knowledge or connections across multiple sectors.

In a setting where the paranormal is real but hidden, researchers across all fields often encounter unexplained phenomena. A biologist studying wildlife in remote BC forests may document cryptids or strange mutations. A psychologist researching sleep disorders might uncover patterns of missing time or abduction experiences. A historian investigating local archives could discover evidence of government cover-ups. A physicist working on classified projects might witness technology that defies known laws. A sociologist studying rural communities may document strange disappearances or collective delusions that aren't delusions at all. Even seemingly mundane fields like forestry, geology, or marine biology can lead researchers into encounters with the unexplained when their work takes them into remote areas where the veil between worlds is thin.

Academia includes those explicitly studying aspects of the unexplained—UFO researchers, parapsychologists, cryptozoologists, and those investigating government conspiracies. More traditionally, academia also encompasses those who study medicine, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and other sciences—all of which may inadvertently brush against the paranormal.

Academics may be unknown outside their particular interests, but they're still respected, partly out of a desire not to look stupid, and partly because their knowledge can be valuable—especially when dealing with phenomena that require intellectual rigor to understand.

**Typical Motivations for Scholarly work are:** Fascination with the subject, discovering hidden knowledge, proving your intelligence, superiority over others, insatiable curiosity or obsession, finding an answer to a great question or problem, outlet for an innate talent, exposing the truth, understanding the unexplained, financial gain through consulting, access to resources or information, helping communities, advancing career, serving multiple employers without specific loyalty.

## Undergraduate Student (Rank 4)

A student pursuing a bachelor's degree at UBC, SFU, UVic, or another BC institution. The life of an undergraduate is rarely one of luxury. They must pay tuition and haven't yet acquired specialized skills, so they have only expenses and not income. Most are the children of the already wealthy, with a sprinkling of brilliant but poor students taken on through scholarships or student loans. **In game effect:** Choose a specialist subject—you gain +2 on Knowledge skills related to this subject. You have access to university libraries and basic facilities.

## Graduate Student, Research Assistant (Rank 5)

A master's or doctoral student, or a research assistant working under a professor. Having acquired a basic understanding of their subject, they are now expected to seek out their own knowledge, usually as an assistant to a more senior academic or as part of a research team. They can now expect to receive a small stipend or income for their work, but unless they make a stupendous discovery it will be meager—barely enough to cover living expenses. The path to promotion is to find some part of their subject in which they can specialize, complete their thesis, and secure a faculty position. **In game effect:** You have access to a laboratory, library, or research facility at your university and gain +1 to relevant skill tests (usually knowledge based) when you are able to visit it. You may have encountered strange phenomena during field research or in archives.

## Lecturer, Instructor (Rank 6)

With years spent studying their chosen subject, an academic finally gains some recognition with a stable income and the chance to teach courses. Lecturers and instructors are often on contract positions, teaching multiple courses but without the security of tenure. It's still unlikely to be a fortune unless they make a particularly valuable discovery, but they're now firmly on the path to higher things. Many lecturers are working toward tenure-track positions. **In game effect:** Other academics respect you; in a city with a university you may seek out colleagues to assist your research and gain a bonus (Director's discretion) to Knowledge or Investigation special skill rolls. You have access to university resources and may have students who can assist with research.

## Assistant Professor (Rank 7)

An Assistant Professor has secured a tenure-track position at a BC university (UBC, SFU, UVic, or another institution). They have established themselves as an authority on their subject, someone that other academics might come to for assistance. They will have students and research assistants of their own, access to research funding, and an income that reflects their position. This is a significant achievement—the first step toward tenure and a permanent academic career. Many assistant professors have encountered strange phenomena during their research, whether they realize it or not. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank (a graduate student or research assistant), they must put two of the special skill points into a Lore or Knowledge skill related to your specialty and the remainder in Lore, Investigation, or Technical skills. You have access to university laboratories, libraries, and research facilities. You can apply for research grants and may have encountered unexplained phenomena that you're investigating—or trying to ignore.

## Associate Professor (Rank 8)

After years of work and achieving tenure, an Associate Professor has secured their position and proven their value to the university. They're considered a solid authority on their subject and suitably informed to judge the work of others. People will seek out their opinion on matters related to their specialism, and their opinions carry weight within academic circles. All this respect comes with perks: a proper income, job security, and the chance to charge for consultations or speaking engagements. Associate professors may consult for government agencies, Indigenous bands, corporations, or other organizations, moving between employers based on opportunities and their own motivations. **In game effect:** When you are not adventuring and living in or near a city with a university, you gain 5d6 x $100 each month as payments for consultations, speaking fees, or research grants. You have greater access to university resources and may have multiple graduate students working under you. You may have consulting relationships with government agencies, Indigenous bands, corporations, or other organizations, providing access to resources and information from multiple sectors.

## Full Professor (Rank 9)

After decades of work, a talented academic can rise to the rank of Full Professor—a tenured position with significant influence within their department and field. They're considered a high authority on their subject and are often called upon to review grants, serve on committees, and mentor junior faculty. Their opinions carry weight not just in academia but in government, industry, and other circles. Full professors often have extensive consulting relationships with government agencies, Indigenous bands, corporations, and other organizations, moving between employers based on opportunities, intellectual interests, or financial incentives. Many full professors have encountered strange phenomena over their careers and may maintain private files or research projects investigating the unexplained. **In game effect:** You have significant influence within your university and field. You can access classified or restricted research, call upon networks of former students and colleagues, and may have knowledge of government projects or paranormal investigations. You have consulting relationships with government agencies, Indigenous bands, corporations, or other organizations, providing access to resources and information from multiple sectors. You gain a follower of Novice rank (a postdoctoral researcher or junior faculty member), they must put their skill points into Knowledge, Investigation, or Technical skills related to your field.

## Distinguished Scholar, Endowed Chair (Rank 10)

Master, Sage, Renowned Expert—With enough talent and years of work behind them, some academics become so well known that their fame reaches beyond the confines of their subject. They may hold endowed chairs, be members of prestigious academies, or have received major awards. They become widely renowned and celebrated across both their own country and internationally. People flock to learn from them, and government officials, corporations, Indigenous bands, and secret organizations invite them to come and offer advice or illumination. Distinguished scholars often have extensive consulting relationships across multiple sectors, working for government agencies on one project, consulting for corporations on another, and advising Indigenous bands on yet another—their loyalty is to their research and their own interests, not to any single employer. Many distinguished scholars have extensive knowledge of unexplained phenomena, either through direct research or through access to classified information from their various consulting relationships. **In game effect:** When you visit a new city, you can contact academics that live there and ask for assistance; what you are offered is at the Director's discretion but could include accommodation, access to libraries and laboratories, and introduction to important citizens or to secret/hidden knowledge that is usually restricted. You have extensive consulting relationships with government agencies, Indigenous bands, corporations, and other organizations, providing access to resources and information from multiple sectors. You may have access to government research facilities, classified archives, corporate research projects, Indigenous knowledge, or connections to organizations investigating the paranormal.
