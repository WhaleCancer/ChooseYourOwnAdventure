# Corporate Elite

In 1985 British Columbia, this category represents those who work for—and rise through the ranks of—the province's most powerful and shadowy corporations. These are not small business owners or independent entrepreneurs, but employees and executives of major corporations that operate with varying degrees of secrecy, ethical flexibility, and connections to unexplained phenomena. Advancement comes through competence, loyalty, discretion, and willingness to look the other way when corporate interests conflict with ethics or the law.

The corporations that define this path include: **Veridine Solutions** (chemical and wellness conglomerate, secretly an Elohim front), **Parabys** (Pacific Abyssal Resources, deep-sea mining with connections to Greys), **Orion International** (resource and remote-sensing with an AI supercomputer and Project PALANTIR), **WestNutr** (Western Nutriments, food processing with mind control additives), **Atlas Minerals** (mining operations in remote areas), **Sterling Timber** (logging with Sasquatch encounters and cover-ups), and **Dominion Petro** (oil and gas with paranormal phenomena at operations). These corporations maintain public faces of respectability while engaging in secretive operations, environmental violations, political influence, and encounters with unexplained phenomena.

At the highest levels are CEOs and board members who control these corporations, coordinate with government agencies, and may have knowledge of—or direct involvement with—paranormal phenomena, alien technology, or supernatural threats. Many of these positions come with expectations of maintaining corporate loyalty, suppressing information, and using corporate resources to advance hidden agendas.

**Paranormal Encounters:** Employees at all levels may encounter unexplained phenomena in the course of their work. Field workers for Sterling Timber may encounter Sasquatch or other cryptids. Parabys deep-sea crews may witness Greys or recover unidentified marine objects. Veridine employees may discover the true nature of the additives they're developing. Orion employees may notice anomalies in satellite data that are classified or suppressed. WestNutr researchers may witness the effects of mind control additives. Atlas Minerals workers in remote locations may encounter strange phenomena. Dominion Petro workers may experience paranormal events at drilling sites. Higher-ranking executives may be briefed on classified projects, coordinate cover-ups, or have direct knowledge of their corporation's true agenda.

**Typical Motivations for a career in the Corporate Elite are:** Pursuit of wealth and power, family tradition, maintaining social position, political influence, expanding business interests, protecting corporate secrets, loyalty to the organization, curiosity about unexplained phenomena, access to classified information, advancement through the ranks.

## Entry-Level Employee (rank 3)

A new hire, intern, or entry-level worker at one of the major corporations. At this level, a person has limited choice about assignments and is often sent where needed.
