# UFO Cults

In 1985 British Columbia, UFO cults are secretive organizations centered around belief in extraterrestrial contact, alien guidance, or cosmic transformation. These groups range from New Age spiritual movements to apocalyptic sects, all sharing a focus on alien entities and the promise of transformation through contact. The most prominent include **The Star Communion** (a New Age UFO religion believing Greys are "Gentle Masters"), **The Watchtower Cleavers** (a polygamous Mormon offshoot fighting against Greys as "Watchers"), and various smaller contactee groups. These cults use the **Golden Doctrine**—Archon-supplied revelations received through dreams, trance, or "channeling"—as the basis for their beliefs. Unlike civilian investigation organizations like **MUFON** (Mutual UFO Network), which approach UFO phenomena through scientific methods, UFO cults are religious or spiritual movements that require faith and belief in their doctrines.

Unlike other organizations, social rank within UFO cults only matters within the cult or to those who recognize it. A cult leader might be respected by members and other cultists, but outsiders may treat them as delusional or dangerous—an encounter that can end poorly. Promotion within a cult depends on demonstrating loyalty, showing spiritual openness, reporting contact experiences, and following the cult's doctrine without question.

**The Truth About UFO Cults:** In reality, the Greys are not benevolent spiritual guides but bioengineered extensions of the Archons—psychic jailers operating from beyond the visible cosmos. The Greys are drone-like, empty vessels programmed to enact their masters' manipulations. UFO cults serve Archon interests by creating willing subjects for their operations, spreading the Golden Doctrine to pacify and control humanity, and reinforcing the prison-cosmos through false hope and deception.

**Typical Motivations for joining a UFO cult are:** Belief in alien contact, seeking spiritual transformation, desire for cosmic unity, fear of the unknown, need for community and belonging, belief in prophecy, pursuit of hidden knowledge, protection from threats, preparation for cosmic events, loyalty to the leader, fighting the hidden threat (for anti-alien cults like the Watchtower Cleavers).

## Seeker, New Convert (rank 3)

Someone newly drawn to a UFO cult, attending meetings, reading cult literature, or exploring contact experiences. Seekers are learning the cult's doctrine, participating in basic rituals, and beginning to interpret their experiences through the cult's lens. They may have had unexplained experiences (missing time, strange dreams, sightings) that drew them to the cult, or they may be searching for meaning and community. Seekers are expected to demonstrate openness and loyalty, and may be asked to contribute financially or assist with basic tasks. **In game effect:** You've learned some basics of cult doctrine and symbols—you gain +1 to your Secret Signs skill tests when dealing with cult-related matters. You have access to cult meetings and basic resources, and may begin to interpret unexplained phenomena through the cult's teachings.

## Member, Believer (rank 4)

A full member who has accepted the cult's doctrine and participates regularly in rituals and activities. Members have learned the cult's teachings, may have reported contact experiences, and are trusted to follow doctrine without question. They contribute financially, assist with cult activities, and may be assigned specific roles or responsibilities. Members begin to understand the deeper meanings in the cult's teachings and may recognize patterns in unexplained phenomena that align with doctrine. **In game effect:** You have access to cult resources and can participate in all cult activities.

You can interpret unexplained phenomena through the cult's teachings.

## Trusted Member, Contactee (rank 5)

A member who has demonstrated loyalty and may have reported significant contact experiences or shown special spiritual openness. Trusted members are given more responsibility, may lead small groups or rituals, and have access to deeper teachings. They may be celebrated for their contact experiences, "sacred implants," or ability to receive messages from the Gentle Masters (or resist the Watchers, depending on the cult). Trusted members often serve as examples to newer members and may be asked to share their experiences. **In game effect:** Pick a Lore or Knowledge skill relevant to your cult (Paranormal Lore for contact experiences, Religion Lore for cult doctrine)—the experience point cost of increasing that skill is halved. You have access to deeper cult teachings and may lead small groups or rituals. You can call upon other members for basic assistance.

## Agent, Chosen Watcher (rank 6)

An experienced member trusted with significant responsibilities, such as recruiting new members, leading rituals, or carrying out the cult's mission. Agents may be part of an inner circle, serve as intermediaries for the leader, or be assigned to specific tasks (recruitment, security, research, or direct action). They have access to cult resources and can make decisions within certain parameters. Agents often have direct knowledge of the cult's true activities and may be involved in operations that outsiders would find disturbing. **In game effect:** You have access to cult resources and can request assistance from other members. You gain +1 to Leadership tests when leading cult activities. You may have access to cult safe houses, vehicles, or equipment. You can coordinate cult activities and may be involved in operations that touch on unexplained phenomena.

## Inner Circle, Herald (rank 7)

Inner circle members may be called "Heralds," "Chosen Watchers," "Elders," or other titles depending on the cult. They help direct the cult's activities, interpret doctrine, and make decisions about members and operations. Inner circle members have significant authority within the cult and access to resources that lower ranks do not. They often have direct knowledge of the cult's true agenda and may be aware of connections to alien entities or supernatural forces. This rank represents the center point for the Status talent—inner circle members have achieved significant standing within their cult and have access to resources and knowledge that lower ranks do not. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank (a trusted member or contactee), they must put their skill points into Social, Lore, or Investigation skills related to cult activities. At the Director's discretion, you can call upon the resources of your cult to aid you when carrying out activities relevant to the cause. You have access to the deepest cult teachings, safe houses, and resources. You can coordinate major cult operations and may have direct knowledge of the cult's true agenda. You have achieved the Status talent center point and have significant standing within your cult.

## Enforcer, Knight (rank 8)

A senior member tasked with maintaining discipline, protecting the cult, and carrying out dangerous operations. Enforcers may be called "Knights," "Guardians," or other titles depending on the cult. They are broadly known and respected within the group, and may lead armed patrols, conduct security operations, or enforce discipline among members. Enforcers often have combat training, access to weapons, and are trusted with the most sensitive operations. They may be involved in direct action against threats, rival cults, or those who oppose the cult's mission. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a person whose interests align with your cult. They must put their skill points into special skills appropriate to your cult's activities (Combat, Investigation, or Social skills). You have access to weapons, vehicles, and resources for security operations. You can coordinate protection and enforcement activities, and may lead armed patrols or direct action operations.

## Master, Prophet's Hand (rank 9)

A very senior member who helps direct the cult's overall strategy and operations. Masters are close advisors to the cult leader, know the deepest secrets, and help shape the cult's doctrine and activities. They have significant authority and can make major decisions about members, operations, and doctrine. Masters often have direct knowledge of the cult's connections to alien entities, supernatural forces, or the true nature of the Golden Doctrine. They may coordinate with other cults, government agencies, or secret organizations. **In game effect:** You have access to all cult resources and can coordinate major operations. You can call upon 2d6 trusted members (SKILL 6 STAMINA 10 Weapon: Handgun or Melee Weapon Armour: Concealed Body Armor) to assist you; this can be done at most once per month. You have comprehensive knowledge of the cult's true agenda and can make major decisions about doctrine, members, and operations. Your position provides you with 1d6 x $1,000 each year in additional income or benefits from cult resources.

## Grand Master, High Elder (rank 10)

A supreme leader or high elder who directs the entire cult or serves as the leader's most trusted advisor. Grand masters know all the mysteries and lore, help shape doctrine, and control lower ranks. They have ultimate authority within the cult and can make decisions that affect all members. Grand masters often have direct knowledge of connections to Archons, Elohim, or the true nature of alien entities. They may coordinate with other cults, government agencies, or supernatural forces. **In game effect:** Choose a location that acts as the headquarters for your cult (a compound, safe house, or meeting place). You can treat this as your home and use its facilities as you desire. The headquarters should be appropriate to your cult (a large house, warehouse, compound, or isolated location). You have access to all cult resources and can coordinate operations across multiple locations. Your position provides you with 2d6 x $1,000 each year in additional income or benefits. You have comprehensive knowledge of the cult's true agenda and connections to alien or supernatural forces.

## Prophet, Cult Leader (rank 11)

The ultimate authority in a UFO cult—the prophet or cult leader who founded the cult or received direct revelation. Prophets claim to have direct contact with alien entities, receive messages through dreams or trance, or interpret the Golden Doctrine for their followers. They have absolute authority within the cult and are treated as spiritual guides or messianic figures. Prophets may have genuine contact experiences (though these are often manipulation by Archons or Elohim), or they may be delusional, charismatic manipulators, or both. They coordinate the cult's activities, shape doctrine, and make decisions that affect all members. Prophets often have direct knowledge of—or may be directly controlled by—Archons, Elohim, or other supernatural forces. **In game effect:** Your position now provides 5d6 x $1,000 each year and you can call upon all cult resources as you desire; however, your actions must always serve the cult's mission (or the agenda of those controlling you). You have comprehensive knowledge of all cult secrets, doctrine, and connections to alien or supernatural forces. You can coordinate operations across all cult locations and can mobilize all members for major operations. You may have direct knowledge of—or be directly controlled by—Archons, Elohim, or other supernatural forces. You are the ultimate authority within your cult, and members will follow your commands without question.
