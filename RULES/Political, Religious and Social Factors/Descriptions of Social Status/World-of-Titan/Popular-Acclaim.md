# Popular Acclaim

A person who performs conspicuous acts can rise to become a folk hero, celebrity or politician. It could be a hero that protects a village, a bard that is known for their extraordinary tales, a gladiator that has caught the eye of the crowd. This path is pursued by many adventurers as it relies on the actions of the individual (or small group) instead of requiring them money or patronage. Words and deeds, not connections. Those that rise in status by popular acclaim can acquire great power but have the risk that an unpopular act or decision can see them fall as fast as they rose! Someone who wishes to pursue this should choose a group they represent - their 'people'. It could be 'the mountain folk', 'poor farmers' or 'the commoners of the city', any group that lacks power in your society.

**Typical Motivations for pursuing popular acclaim are:** Seeking fame, vanity, defending friends & family, love of your home, fighting against injustice, fighting for a downtrodden or powerless group.

## Local Hero (rank 4)

The village champion, the Big Fella, the Wise Woman - a person who, through their deeds, has distinguished themselves and earned the thanks of a small group. Not known outside this area, the local hero gets little compensation - maybe a discount here and there, a free meal or pint of beer occasionally and in return when trouble comes they are expected to step forward and deal with it. **In game effect:** +2 Bargain skill tests in this community.

## Pride of the County (rank 5)

A figure that is known to fight for their community across a number of towns and villages, someone who has shown they are brave and capable on more than one occasion. The rewards come in the form of discounts and favours, maybe some small pieces of equipment and in return the pride of the county is expected to rush to help when the poor folk call on them. **In game effect:** +2 Leadership skill tests in this community.

## Champion (rank 6)

The people's champion is widely known for their bravery and determination to face any threats to the common folk. It might be hunting down a dangerous ogre that was on the loose or standing up to a bad lord and making change the law. In return the champion is likely to be provided with not just gifts and assistance but gold in the form of prizes or rewards. When trouble does arise, the champion is the first in line to face it. **In game effect:** Food, drink and everyday items are now half price whilst in your community.

## Hero (rank 7)

The deeds of a hero are retold widely, often embellished. A hero is someone that the people admire and look up to; a role-model for their children. This doesn't have to be simple bravery and skill at arms. A great playwright might become so famous and popular that they become a hero, an explorer that brings back treasures and stories from far away could also be considered heroes. As with others who rise by popular acclaim there is no specific income associated with the role, but a hero will have access to people and places that would usually be denied to their 'class' and will be showered in gifts and help from admirers. Most of their wealth will come from their deeds (plunder etc). Many are known by a nickname that reflects their deeds e.g. Erwist, Master of the Thunder Seas. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank and you may spend their skill points as you please.

## Hero of Legend (rank 9)

As the fame and popularity of a person grows, they may find their exploits detailed in story and song. These people are now living legends, with the line between fiction and reality starting to blur - the warrior that slays a giant with a single blow, the sage that can answer any question. They still have to find a source of income for themselves, but few people will refuse an opportunity to spend time with or help a legend, and they are likely to be made welcome in houses of the wealthy. Often they become known by a brief moniker, e.g. Seamaster Erwist, or just 'The Seamaster'. **In game effect:** Each completed mission grants you 5d6gp extra in the form of gifts and treasures sent by admirers.

## Hero of Myth (rank 11)

The ultimate stage of popular acclaim - someone who is so widely admired and discussed that the line between fact and fiction becomes completely blurred. The explorer who travelled around the world faster than the wind, the artist whose paintings were so realistic they came to life and so on. The stories may become so ridiculous that the actual individual is a disappointment! Still, those that reach this level of fame are treated with respect and adoration across a wide section of society. Their presence is considered a great honour and they will invariably be showered with gifts and assistance. By this point, a hero of myth is often known just by a single name e.g. 'Erwist' being enough to strike fear into every pirate on the seas. **In game effect:** You no longer have to pay for food & accommodation whilst in your community and any normal item of less than 100gp value will be provided to you without charge (it's assumed that you don't resell them!). If you need it, your community will provide a militia of 5d6 soldiers (SKILL 7 STAMINA 10 Weapon: Sword Armour: Leather Hauberk and Small shield) that will serve you for up to a month.
