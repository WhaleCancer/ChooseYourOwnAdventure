# Military

Every military is different but they all have one thing in common; they all love to create ranks and structures to maintain organisation and ensure the chain of command functions. Ranks in the British army include (but are not limited to) private, corporal, sergeant, officer, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel, brigadier, general and field marshall. Clearly this is far more detailed than most people require in their adventures, though in some settings working your way up this type of structure can be the basis of an entire campaign. Promotion in the military is supposed to be based on bravery and leadership, but often comes down to patronage. The military structure is also applicable to groups such as police, mercenary organisations or watchmen.

**Typical Motivations for Military work are:** Love of combat, proving your valour, bloodlust, pursuit of physical perfection, desperation (no other options), forced enrolment (conscripted), loyalty to a kingdom or cause, pursuit of wealth (mercenary or pillage), family tradition.

## Soldier (rank 3)

A trooper, grunt, sailor or enlisted man. One of the cannon fodder. At this level a person has no choice about where and when they go. The hours are long, conditions terrible and the pay, when it arrives, barely enough to cover the cost of replacing your boots. Many soldiers spend their money on wine, women and song, and the rest they waste. **In game effect:** You are provided with a weapon and a leather hauberk, which you are expected to look after. You may sleep and eat in the 'barracks' when in your home location.

## Officer (rank 4)

An officer is in charge of a unit of troops, size depending on the structure of the military. Their main job is to make sure orders are carried out by the soldiers or seamen and in particular to stop them from routing in the face of danger. Officers get slightly better pay and conditions, but are still required to do as their superiors command and frequently have to purchase their own equipment. Pillaging is a significant source of income. **In game effect:** You have learned to be a bully when required - gain +1 to your Con skill tests.

## Captain (rank 5)

In charge of a number of units making up a company and has some limited autonomy when it comes to giving orders. A captain will receive a decent income from the army and will be provided with reasonable accommodation, but they will also be expected to maintain a certain level of lifestyle. With many young men in the army, excessive drinking, gambling and entertaining is a common way to go broke. **In game effect:** You have gained skill in command, you have +1 to your Leadership tests.

## Colonel (rank 7)

The lowest rank of the command structure of the army, a colonel has the responsibility to act as liaison between the high level decision makers and the commanders in the field. Their ability to interpret those orders and how exactly they should be implemented makes the difference between a good and bad colonel. As a senior figure in the army they receive a good level of pay, topped up with pillage and some 'redirection' of the military budget. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a young warrior eager to learn from you, they must put their skill points into Combat and Movement special skills.

## General (rank 9)

A member of the command who has the job of interpreting military intelligence and turning it into plans of action. They may or may not be in the field; the outcome of battles often depends on their ability to make the right call about troop deployments and tactics. In addition to their pay, most generals will also receive land and holdings, plus the not inconsiderable opportunities demand favours from the trade princes in return for military assistance. On the downside, making the wrong call might well be fatal. **In game effect:** You gain a horse or other appropriate mount and a holding (land or rights over a trade) that provides you with 1d6 x 100gp each year. In addition you are provided with masterwork weapons and armour.

## Field Marshall (rank 11)

Responsible for an entire theatre of war, reports directly to the heads of the armed forces (usually the nobility or rulers) and rarely attends the front lines. A field marshall advises the rulers about the overall strength of the armies and navies, ways to improve them and the costs involved. They are often given noble ranks for their service with the usual land and holdings to supplement their income but the really big money comes from pillage; a smart field marshall will be on hand to pick up the best pieces of plunder. On the downside, they can be held personally responsible for a failure and see their riches, or their lives, stripped from them. **In game effect:** Your holdings now provide 5d6x100gp each year and you can call upon your organisations forces as you desire; however, your actions can lead to swift punishment if you upset the rulers of whichever kingdom or land they represent.
