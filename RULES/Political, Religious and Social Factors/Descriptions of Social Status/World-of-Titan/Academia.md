# Academia (including scholars of magic)

Some people dedicate their lives to exploring the mysteries of the world in order to understand them, share their knowledge and put it to use in everyday life. An academic might be a teacher in a great university, but they could also be a lone inventor, magical researcher or seeker of lost knowledge. Academics rise in their field by either brilliant displays of intellect, or by the slower process of accumulating rare and valuable knowledge. They don't always end up with riches, in fact many spend all the gold they can on acquiring rare books, strange devices or materials needed in their research, but a few do find some way of turning their discoveries into wealth. In a fantasy setting, academia includes those that dedicate their lives to studying aspects of magic such as wizards and sorcerers. More traditionally, academia also encompasses those who study non-magical medicine, such as physicians and surgeons.

Academics may be unknown outside of their particular interests, but they are still respected, partly out of a desire not to look stupid!

**Typical Motivations for Scholarly work are:** Fascination with the subject, discovering ancient knowledge, proving your intelligence, superiority over others, insatiable curiosity or obsession, finding an answer to a great question or problem, outlet for an innate talent.

## Student (Rank 4)

Sometimes called an apprentice or pupil, the life of a student is rarely one of luxury. They must pay their tutor and have not yet acquired skills of worth, so they have only expenses and not income. Because of that most are the children of the already wealthy, with a sprinkling of a few brilliant but poor pupils that have been taken on out of charity. Graduating from student to researcher is at the mercy of their teachers. **In game effect:** Choose a specialist subject - you gain +2 on Knowledge skills related to this subject.

## Researcher (Rank 5)

Having acquired a basic understanding of their subject, the researcher is now expected to seek out their own knowledge usually as an assistant to a more senior academic. They can now expect to receive a small income for their work but unless they make some stupendous discovery it will be a meagre amount. The path to promotion is to find some part of their subject in which they can specialise. **In game effect:** You have access to a laboratory or library and gain +1 to relevant skill tests (usually knowledge based) when you are able to visit it.

## Lecturer (Rank 6)

With years spent pondering the intricacies of their chosen subject, an academic finally gains some recognition with a stable income and the chance to take on students of their own. It is still unlikely to be a fortune unless they make a particularly valuable discovery, but they are now firmly on the path to higher things. **In game effect:** Other academics respect you; in a city you may seek them out to assist your research and gain a bonus (Directors discretion) to Knowledge or Magical special skill rolls.

## Reader (Rank 7)

A Reader, Senior Lecturer, or Assistant Professor has established themself as an authority on their subject, someone that other academics might come to for assistance. They will have students and researchers of their own and an income that reflects it. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, they must put two of the special skill points into a Lore skill related to your speciality and the remainder in Lore or Magical.

## Professor (Rank 8)

After decades of work a talented academic can rise to the point where they are considered a high authority on their subject and suitably informed to judge the work of others. People will seek out their opinion on matters related to not just their specialism but also other matters of thought and their opinions carry weight. All this respect comes with perks; a proper income and the chance to charge for access to your mind. **In game effect:** When you are not adventuring and living in or near a city or large population, you gain 5d6gp each month as payments for consultations.

## Genius (Rank 10)

Master, Sage, Philosopher - With enough talent and years of work behind them some academics or intellectuals become so well known that their fame reaches beyond the confines of their subject. They became widely renowned and celebrated across both their own realm and others. People flock to learn from them and nobles and merchants invite them to come and offer advice or illumination. **In game effect:** When you visit a new city, you can contact academics that live there and ask for assistance; what you are offered is at the Directors discretion but could include accommodation, access to libraries and laboratories and introduction to important citizens or to secret / hidden knowledge that is usually restricted.
