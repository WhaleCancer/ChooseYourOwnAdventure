# Secret or Private Societies

The hardest to describe, because they will all vary according to their purposes and history, but we can describe a few similarities. They have a purpose, which means a leadership that sets out what that purpose is, agents that put it into action, members who assist (often financially) and initiates that are on their way to full membership. Unlike other organisations the social rank of these clubs only matters within the society or to those that respect it. For example, the head of a crime syndicate would be respected by its members and people that recognised them, but a stranger might well treat them as merely a criminal - an encounter that is unlikely to end well!

Not all secret or private societies are malicious; an explorers club or guardians of an ancient treasure could fall into this category. Promotion within the society will generally be in the hands of its leaders and income and expenses depend heavily on its nature. A crime syndicate will be risky but rewarding, a society dedicated to keeping an ancient secret will probably not come with much in the way of earnings.

**Typical Motivations for joining a secret or private society are:** Uncovering lost or hidden knowledge, criminal or outlaw ventures, loyalty to the leader, privacy or secrecy, paranoia, pursuit of unusual ambitions, belief in a prophecy, safeguarding a great secret, a duty passed down in your family.

## Initiate (Rank 3 within the Society)

Just brought into the group, the initiate will be expected to carry out the wishes of the higher ups without question; they will also be expected to pay some form of fee or tribute as part of their membership. Promotion comes from being loyal and capable. **In game effect:** You've learnt some basics of using codes and markers, you gain +1 to your Secret Signs skill tests.

## Member (Rank 5 within the Society)

After proving their loyalty an initiate might be taken on as a full member; sometimes this means learning new secrets or mysteries or just taking on new responsibilities. A member has some respect but they are still tools of the masters. **In game effect:** Pick a Lore skill that is relevant to your secret or private society (Sea Lore for a group of Mariners) - the experience point cost of increasing that skill is halved. If this is a criminal society you may choose Con or City Lore.

## Agent (Rank 7 within the Society)

An experienced member will be allowed to make their own decisions and make demands of initiates or members, within certain parameters. An agent will have their own area of responsibility, though it may be small. **In game effect:** At the Director's discretion you can call upon the resources of your secret or private society to aid you when carrying out activities that are relevant to the cause e.g. An explorers club would help provide funds and equipment for an expedition to an unknown island.

## Enforcer (Rank 9 within the Society)

A more senior agent that is tasked with checking on the others (and members and initiates) and taking steps to keep them in line. An enforcer will be broadly known and respected within the group. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a person whose interests align with your group. they must put their skill points into special skills that are appropriate to your 'interests'.

## Master (Rank 11 within the Society)

A loyal and competent member may eventually rise to the position of master, someone who knows the secrets and plans of the society and helps direct it towards its goals. A master will expect instant obedience from the lesser ranks. **In game effect:** When in a location important to your society you can call upon 2d6 initiates (SKILL 6 STAMINA 10 Weapon: Axe Armour: Leather Hauberk) to assist you; this can be done at most once per month. You do not need to explain yourself.

## Grand Master (Rank 12 within the Society)

If the group has a supreme leader, this is it. The grand master knows all the mysteries and lore, and controls the lower ranks like a puppet master. To those within the society, the grand master is on a par with any ruler or high priest of their realm. **In game effect:** Choose a location that acts as the headquarters for your society. You can now treat this as your home and use its facilities as you desire. The headquarters should be appropriate to your society and should be of good but not opulent character (so a large house or tower, but not a keep or palace).
