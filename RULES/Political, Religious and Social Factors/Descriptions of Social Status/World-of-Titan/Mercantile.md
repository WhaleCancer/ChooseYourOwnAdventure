# Mercantile

The pursuit of riches through purely business acumen is a common occupation and is respected, if not always loved in most societies. There is no formal structure to advancement in this field, it's all about how much gold you can accumulate. A hugely successful farmer, with many acres of land, would be higher in status than a struggling art dealer. Positions in this endeavour are measured in results, not titles.

**Typical Motivations for joining a Mercantile career are:** Pursuit of wealth and status, family inheritance, talent for business, desperation (escape from poverty), means to an end, competitive instinct, funding another aim, revenge (destroying another merchant), funding other aims, exploitation.

## Peasant (Rank 3)

'Basic economic unit' may seem like an insult but it is a fair description. Peasants make up the largest part of the population and do most of the actual work; their opportunities to escape poverty are limited. Unlike a slave or a serf a peasant has the right to earn a bit of coin for themselves. A smart or lucky peasant finds a way to move up the ladder through skill, persuasion or sometimes dishonesty. **In game effect:** None. Good Luck!

## Crafter (Rank 4)

Someone who has established a skill at a particular craft or trade, e.g. shoemaker, butcher, farrier etc. No longer expected to carry out drudge work, a crafter (often an apprentice) has taken the first step toward some form of wealth. Frequently, taking up a trade involves joining a guild that regulates and controls it. **In game effect:** Pick a Crafting special skill and gain one point in it. You can earn 1d6gp a week from your skills, provided you have access to a workshop and tools.

## Trader (Rank 5)

There are only so many hours in the day, so in order to become wealthy a person needs to learn to trade; effectively making a profit from the work of others. A trader has set up a business and spends less time doing the work and more time managing it and establishing links with other traders. As with a crafter, this will probably have to be done with the approval of a guild or guilds that manage the trade. **In game effect:** You spend a lot of time haggling and negotiating; gain +1 to your Bargain skill rolls. Your trading brings in 2d6gp per week if you devote your time to it.

## Owner (Rank 7)

A business that grows eventually needs premises, equipment and employees, with the owner at the top directing operations and reaping the profits. With the money coming in, a business owner starts to get more attention from other parts of society, usually looking for a handout! **In game effect:** If you acquire a premises (shop or workshop) your business will now provide you with 1d6gp per week in profit, or 3d6gp per week if you devote your time to it.

## Merchant (Rank 8)

A truly successful owner will continue to expand their operations; multiple workshops, varied routes of trade, a wider product range, warehouses and maybe ships and wagons. A business becomes a widely known enterprise, with activity in more than one location and money flowing through it like lifeblood. A merchant may not be 'noble' but they will certainly find the higher-ups in society treating them with respect. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, a person whose interests align with your group. they must put their skill points into special skills that are appropriate to your 'interests'. Your business has now grown to cover several locations and brings in 4d6gp per week in profit if you make a Bargain skill test, or 2d6gp if you fail the test.

## Merchant Prince (Rank 11)

The pinnacle of economic success, a merchant prince has accumulated vast wealth. With their fingers in a number of economic pies, they will be owners of one or more significant businesses and have control of a significant trade. Control over an important spice route, ownership of a fleet of ships, control over the gem trade within a kingdom would all be examples of what it takes to become a merchant prince. With this level of wealth there comes enormous power in other areas and there will be a long line of people seeking them out for help and assistance. The trappings of a merchant prince will be very similar to those of the highest nobility and many seek out opportunities to flaunt their riches. **In game effect:** Your business has now grown into a web of interests and activities that creates a constant stream of problems to solve. You gain one skill point in two of City Lore, Bargain, Law or Languages as you try to cope. It brings in 2d6 x 10gp per week in profit if you make a Bargain skill test, or 1d6 x 10gp if you fail the test. Dealing with others grants you one point in either the Law or Languages skills.
