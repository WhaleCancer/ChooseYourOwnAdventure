# Nobility

The purpose of the nobility is to defend the realm and manage land and trade. However they are organised and whatever their ranks are called, these are the people who own the land, decide the rules of trade and raise militias and armies to defend it. Referred to as 'my Lord / Lady', a good noble makes the best use of their holdings and gains the respect and admiration of the people, whereas a bad or cruel one will become a tyrant to those peasants unfortunate enough to live on their land. Promotion and demotion in the noble ranks are either by inheritance or patronage. Many titles pass from parent to child - often father to son but not always - and gaining new titles or advancing requires a higher ranked person to sponsor the advance.

At the head of the nobility is the monarchy (king, queen, prince, princess) which are referred to as 'Your highness' or 'Your majesty'. Often the monarchy is referred to as 'the house of so-and-so'. Joining this rank is generally only possible by accident of birth or marriage.

**Typical Motivations for a career in the Nobility are:** Family tradition, pursuit of status or power, vanity, loyalty to a kingdom or nation, sponsorship by a patron, political influence, pursuit of wealth.

## Knight (rank 6)

A knight holds the title 'sir' but is not considered a Lord or truly part of the nobility. They are trusted retainers and vassals of the lord or lady, usually in some military role. Becoming a knight is often the first step towards higher ennoblement. A knight's income comes from their personal holdings and estate, they are expected to purchase their knightly equipment, such as horses, a lance, armour and so on, which means that many knights are quite poor unless they have some income from pillaging or from a wealthy sponsor. **In game effect:** You are granted title to a small parcel of land (or other holdings) which grants you 2d6 x 10gp income each year. You gain +2 to Bargain & Etiquette tests when dealing with others who owe allegiance to the same Lord and +1 when dealing with other nobility.

## Baron (rank 7)

Owner of a small parcel of land worked by serfs and peasants, the job of the baron is to maintain law and order, keep the peasants working and, along with any knights, lead them in battle. The income of a baron will depend on the quality of their land and people and their ability to manage them well. Some of the peasants will be servants to the baron. **In game effect:** Your land (or other holdings) are increased granting you 2d6 x 20gp income each year. In addition you gain a follower of novice rank. You are expected to maintain a house or residence of some sort.

## Viscount (rank 8)

A step up from a baron, a viscount has both holdings and additional duties and responsibilities such as trade rights at a small port, castellan of a castle, judge and so on which will provide an additional source of income. They are generally learned people capable of more than just farming. Will have a decent house or manor and a small household staff, some of their income will be spent on ceremonial clothing and their trappings. **In game effect:** In addition to your holdings you are given a position of importance that provides another 2d6 x 20gp income each year, provided you spend at least one week performing your duties.

## Earl or Count (rank 9)

Owner of a significant area of land, probably encompassing one or more towns. Their duties are similar to a baron's but they don't deal directly with the peasants. They will have one or more good quality homes and a staff to manage them. They may be expected to attend court and will own appropriate clothing and trappings. **In game effect:** Your holdings and lands have increased again, now providing 2d6 x 100gp income each year. In addition you are expected to attend court at least once a year. You are expected to maintain a reasonably grand residence in which you can entertain other nobles.

## Marquess, Margrave (rank 10)

An earl or count that is favoured by the monarch and on their way to becoming a duke. As well as owning land, they will have a manor or estate and staff to run it, and they are likely to have a specific role to play at court or on behalf of the monarch which might become a significant expense. **In game effect:** Your holdings and lands have increased again, now providing 2d6 x 500gp income each year. You are expected to maintain a grand residence, fully staffed, in which you can entertain other nobles.

## Duke (rank 11)

Owner of a large area of land called a Duchy. As well as promoting the wealth of their duchy through farming and trade they are charged with ensuring that military strength is well trained and available to the monarchy when needed. Expected to attend court regularly and house the monarch when they are travelling, a duty which can be an exorbitant cost particularly if they are trying to impress their ruler. A duke is expected to dress and behave like a duke; a lot of income is spent on maintaining appearances. **In game effect:** Your holdings and lands have increased again, now providing 2d6 x 1,000gp income each year. You are expected to attend court or be in contact with your monarch on a regular basis. Your residence, style and bearing are expected to be of high quality and the monarch will censure you if they are not. You will be given a position that is important to your kingdom, e.g. ambassador, commander of the army, chief judge etc.

## Monarch (rank 12)

The King, Queen, Sultan, Tzar, Emperor and so on. Depending on the society they may be an absolute ruler - in which case the wealth of the entire realm is available to them - or they may be restrained in some way by other important groups (the nobility, churches, trade princes etc). They will certainly own a great deal of land and houses, with their wealth being used to maintain and improve these properties. A monarch is expected to maintain a court along with all its trappings (food, entertainment etc) and these costs, along with the costs of defending the realm, often mean the monarch controls great wealth but struggles to hold on to it. A smart monarch spends within their means, but a foolish one can end up in debt and at risk of losing their throne. **In game effect:** Your holdings and lands have increased again, now providing 2d6 x 5,000gp income each year. You are expected to acquire a fully staffed palace and hold court, most of your time will be occupied by dealing with the other nobles and affairs of state. You can command your armies and people to make war, if you are able to persuade the other nobles of the cause.
