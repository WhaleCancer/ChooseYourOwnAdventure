# Religious

All religions are different, yet in some ways they are all the same. At the top there is either a single person (pope, high priest etc) or council that determines the doctrine of the church, based on either interpretation of sacred texts or direct communication with their god, and then passes that down through the organisation to promote the message and recruit followers.

Rising from a follower to the leader of a church can be a slow and involved process and there is a strong expectation that anyone taking a formal position in a religion will be expected to carry out religious duties (running a temple, holding ceremonies etc) which will probably prevent them from doing much adventuring. However, some churches may reward followers for carrying out extreme acts of heroism, provided they support the teachings of their god. At the lowest level the work of a religion is concerned with maintaining holy sites such as temples or shrines and preaching to the masses. Collecting donations is an important part of church work at every level and whilst the income of high ranking church members may be large it is expected that the bulk will be spent in the service of the church - charitable works (if appropriate), building and maintaining temples, commissioning artists to celebrate their god.

Churches often have branches in other parts of society, such as inquisitors which are para-military priests that might have ranks more closely related to the military classifications, or preachers that are not attached to a temple and are closer to folk heroes.

**Typical Motivations for Religious work are:** Worshipping your god, defending your church and its followers, battling against an opposed religion, pursuing a prophecy or vision, moral and philosophical convictions.

## Minister (rank 4)

Followers of the religion, ministers carry out day-to-day management of the church and holy sites. Only officiate minor ceremonies and may have other jobs besides their work with the church. Often any spare income is donated to the church. **In game effect:** +2 Religion Lore skill for your religion.

## Priest (rank 6)

Preachers, missionaries - they are charged with holding ceremonies and may be assigned a temple or holy site as their responsibility. Their income is expected to be used in service of the church although some personal spending is expected. **In game effect:** When defending a site connected to your religion, gain +1 to all skill rolls.

## Bishops, Prelates (rank 8)

Responsible for overseeing the behaviour of a number of priests, may also have their own holy site or temple to manage. A bishop will be provided with a residence and a small number of staff, such as a housekeeper, to assist them. Income is expected to be spent on maintaining a lifestyle appropriate to the religion. **In game effect:** You are provided with a residence, a building owned by your church but put at your disposal. The residence comes with a small staff (cook, maid).

## Archbishops (rank 9)

Overseeing a large area or population and keeping control of the bishops whilst creating wider strategies for advancing the religion, often involving politics, are the jobs of an archbishop. In most cases they will be provided with a residence and staff by the church which they are expected to maintain to a high standard. As with other clergy their income is supposed to be spent in a way that reflects the teachings of the church, though of course this is not always the case. **In game effect:** You gain a follower of Novice rank, they must put two of the special skill points into Religion Lore and the remainder in Lore, Magical or Combat skills.

## Cardinals (rank 10)

Assistants to the high priest or pope, learned in church lore and responsible for turning the message of the church into teachings, ceremonies and advice which they then pass on to the Archbishops & wider clergy. Cardinals are also diplomats and envoys for the church and can speak on behalf of their leader. The church provides houses and a significant staff, in some luxury, but as usual the income of a cardinal should be used for the glory of the church. **In game effect:** Your residence is larger and better appointed. It is connected to a site which is sacred to your church. The staff is increased and your church provides a significant budget for entertaining and events.

## High Priest, Pope, Patriarch, Caliph, Prophet, Messiah (rank 11)

The earthly leader of the church, with ultimate responsibility to ensure that their god's will is done on the mortal plane. They may claim to have direct contact with the deity but even if they don't the high priest is the ultimate authority on what a follower of the religion should do or not do. Often involved with politics at the highest level, they may be seen as equal to or superior to monarchs. They will have a main residence at or near the most significant holy site, a large staff to support them and possibly a small personal army. As with other clergy, any 'extra' income should be spent on glorifying their god, often by building new temples or hiring artists to decorate the existing ones. **In game effect:** You have a personal bodyguard of 2d6 warriors, provided by your church. They have SKILL 8 STAMINA 12 Weapon: Spear Armour: Breastplate & Small Shield. They will try to accompany you at all times, like it or not. If any of them die they will be replaced in 2d6 days. The church is very protective of you!
