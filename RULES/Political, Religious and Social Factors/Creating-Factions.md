# 7.3 Creating Factions

Whilst this book is focused on creating games for heroes either solo or in small groups, it is worth noting that the rules provided can be used to create factions, which you may wish to do if you are running a longer campaign with some level of political intrigue.

In order to build up a picture of a faction, we need to work out some details such as are they good or evil, interested in war or politics and so on. The 'domain', location, race (main race, factions can include more than one type of person) and motivation for a faction can all be taken from the 'Generated Villains' (section 9.2). Combine this with the Political Systems & Religion tables (section 7.1) to give you the outline of their behaviour. The leader of the faction can be created using the rules for creating villains or simply based on what you already know about it (A faction that is obsessed with religious matters will be led by a priest, a faction that is obsessed with politics will have a demagogue as its leader and so on).

A few extra elements are required - the size of the faction and their level of secrecy, which can be easily generated.

## Faction Size

| 1d6 | Size | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | Small | This group or faction has few members and meeting them is rare. |
| 2-5 | Moderate | This group has a significant presence and meeting a member is unremarkable. |
| 6 | Large | This group has a lot of members and meeting them is commonplace. |

A second roll on this table can tell you how the faction is changing:

- 1: Shrinking
- 2-5: Stable
- 6: Growing

## Faction Secrecy

| 1d6 | Secrecy | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Hidden | This group of people try and hide their membership and activities from the wider population. |
| 2-5 | Indifferent | This group does not hide or proclaim their activities or membership. |
| 6 | Public | This group actively proclaims and declares their activities and membership. |

Combining these details or facets should give you a pretty rounded description of your new faction. Ideas for the social structure and titles within the faction can be obtained from the section on Social Status & Ranks (section 7.2). It is up to the player or Director to turn all these elements into a fleshed out account of what the faction is and what it does. A faction can simply be a part of your world or they can be the reason for missions and quests to happen - if that is the case, treat them as a villain and create your missions according to the usual rules.

## Example

As we are drawing elements from different parts of this book it is worth giving an example to show how it works.

Janay The Just, a priestess of Libra, is spending a week relaxing in Ludria and decides to spend some time in the inns and taverns hearing rumours about the world she lives in (in out of game terms, the Director is going to create some factions for her to interact with). The Director starts rolling dice and it goes as follows.

**Step 1: From the Generated Villains section, 9.2.**

- Domain - 2: Fury of the Gods - the faction is religious in some way
- Location - 5: Dungeon - the faction base is in a dungeon
- Race - 1: Human - may include other races but the majority are human
- Motivation - 3: (From the Fury of the Gods motivation table): Prophecy - they believe in an ancient prophecy, nothing can be allowed to prevent it from happening as ordained.
- Lair - 5: A tower, full of strange and dangerous objects. The Director decides that, for the moment, this tower will be above the dungeon.
- Henchman - 4: Tree men, which can be used for encounters with this faction
- Retaliation - 3: Animated Club (maybe they have access to some wood based magic?)
- Battle Tactics - not required at this point, as it is only available to villains, not rank and file personnel

**Step 2: From the Political Systems & Religions section. 7.1.**

- Morality - 2: Neutral (if you wish to create a 'villain' faction you may want to choose 'evil').
- Control - 6: Strong
- Gods - 8: Worship the neutral gods - determine that to be Aqualis (god of rivers) from the religion table (this part may not be relevant to all factions. Those that pursue the 'Fury of the Gods' will need to be assigned a specific god, but other factions do not have to be).

**Step 3: Using the tables in this section.**

- Size - 4: Moderate (5: Stable)
- Secrecy - 1: Hidden

In the Social Structure & Ranks section 7.2, we have no dice to roll but instead, based on what information we have so far, we can decide that this is either a religious based organisation or perhaps a secret society. The fact that it is 'Hidden' means the Director decides it is a mix of secret society and religious organisation that can have ranks from both. It will be led by a high priest of Aqualis, but also include members that have no priestly powers and are, broadly speaking, cultists, though this doesn't mean they are evil, just that they are ultimately dedicated to a religious cause but are hiding their purpose from outsiders. We can create ranks for this organisation such as 'wetfoot' for an initiate, 'mudlark' for a full member, 'heron' for a senior person and 'king of the river' for the leader. Use the descriptions of social status given earlier in this chapter to assign them a social rank.

**Final Step: Blend it Together.**

Taking what we have rolled into consideration we decide that the faction is a cult of Aqualis dedicated to an ancient prophecy concerning their god (to be decided later on, perhaps to do with some kind of great flood they believe to be imminent). They are based in a dungeon on top of which stands an ancient tower, guarded by Tree Men (is this part of the prophecy?) and their access to some kind of wood based magic allows them to send animated clubs to target those that bother them. They have a decent number of members (boatmen? Fishermen? People who work on or near rivers could all be members) and are hidden from the general population. This is not because they are evil, merely secretive, but they are good at staying out of sight (strong control).

We don't know yet if they are going to be an ally or enemy for Janay the Just, but now we know they exist in the world, we can work them into our stories and adventures. We could, for example, create a villain based on this faction (their leader or high priest) and create missions using them as an opponent. Or, we can simply include members of this faction in the background scenery of the world, perhaps as allies or acquaintances for Janay as she goes about her adventures.
