# Advanced Fighting Fantasy Weapons

## Source Material

This document combines weapons rules from two sources:

- **Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Edition** - Fantasy weapons, combat options, critical hits, fumbles, and missile combat rules extracted from pages 57-65 of the AFF 2nd Ed rulebook.
- **Stellar Adventures** - Science fiction weapons organized by technology level (Basic, Low Tech, Medium Tech, High Tech) extracted from the Stellar Adventures RPG rulebook.

All content is extracted directly from the source material with no additions or modifications beyond organization and formatting.

## Weapons Overview

Weapons in Advanced Fighting Fantasy use a damage track system that converts a D6 damage roll into STAMINA damage. Each weapon has a damage track with columns for rolls of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7+. The winner of a combat round rolls 1D6 for damage and consults the appropriate weapon table.

In Stellar Adventures, weapons are grouped by technology level (Basic, Low Tech, Medium Tech, High Tech) and use the same damage track system. Some weapons also include ammunition and range information.

## Weapon Descriptions

### Basic Tech Missile Weapons

**Arrow - Longbow** - This is a standard arrow that can be fired from a Longbow. The range and damage of the arrow will both be affected by the bow used. Arrows are carried in a quiver of 20.

**Arrow - Shortbow** - This is a standard arrow that can be fired from a Shortbow. The range and damage of the arrow will both be affected by the bow used. Arrows are carried in a quiver of 20.

**Crossbow** - This primitive weapon fires bolts from a metal bow mounted on a wood or metal stock. Crossbows are occasionally constructed from more modern materials, but use the same design. Although only a single bolt can be loaded at a time, this weapon can be loaded and fired in the same round. Bolts are usually carried in a wooden case of 20 bolts.

**Javelin** - A light spear designed to be thrown, this weapon can at a stretch be used in hand-to-hand combat. A javelin only requires a single hand to use effectively.

**Throwing Dagger** - A specially weighted version of the common dagger, this dagger is designed to be thrown short distances. These knives can also be used in hand-to-hand combat (inflicting the same damage). There is no reload time to grab another knife.

**Sling** - A simple weapon consisting of a leather pouch and two cords, used to hurl stones or lead bullets.

### Basic Melee Weapons

**Battle Axe** - This large double-headed axe is wielded with two hands, so cannot be used with a shield, but is capable of doing large amounts of damage. This is a popular weapon with Dwarf warriors.

**Handaxe** - This single-bladed axe is designed to be wielded one handed.

**Dagger** - This is a small bladed weapon, carried in a belt sheath or easily concealed in clothing, boots and even hats! Daggers are a popular choice for thugs, assassins and as a popular backup weapon.

**Club** - Simply a heavy length of wood, the club is one of the simplest and cheapest weapons available. To be truly effective as a weapon, the club must have the right weight distribution and shape.

**Greatsword** - These two-handed swords can be taller than a man, and cannot be used with a shield. Difficult to carry and impossible to conceal, these weapons are fearsome when wielded by a skilled fighter.

**Sword** - The most common weapon amongst adventurers, swords come in various shapes, lengths and sizes. Broadswords, longswords, scimitars and falchions are all popular amongst adventurers and monsters alike.

**Short Sword** - This weapon is cheap, easy to use and effective, and is very popular with militia, soldiers and cash-strapped adventurers.

**Lance** - A long spear designed for mounted combat, typically used from horseback.

**Mace** - Essentially a heavy metal flanged head on a handle, a mace is an advanced version of a club. The head may have spikes, flanges, studs or bulges, or indeed may be smooth.

**Morning Star** - A heavy spiked ball connected by a short chain to a wooden handle, this weapon has the potential to do lots of damage, but is also difficult to use, having a modifier of -2 to the wielder's attack total.

**Polearm** - A long shaft, often up to 10' in length, with a blade, axe or spear head at one end, polearms are popular with guards. Polearms are not often used by adventurers due to the inconvenience of using a weapon of this length in the cramped environs of a dungeon or forest, and also because it requires two hands to use. If this weapon is used in cramped conditions such as indoors or a dungeon, there will be a penalty of between -1 and -5, depending on just how cramped the conditions are.

**Quarterstaff** - Simply a smoothed heavy wooden shaft, a staff is used to aid walking when travelling, and as a simple, easy to use weapon popular with Sorcerers and Wizards.

**Spear** - One of the most popular and common weapons, spears are simply a small bladed head on a wooden shaft. Very easy to make, repair and maintain, they are stockpiled in villages, guard towers and other garrisons.

**Warhammer** - This heavy hammer head on a long handle usually also has a spike on the opposite side and can be used to bludgeon or stab opponents.

**Improvised Weapons** - This covers anything not specifically constructed as a weapon but being used as such. This often includes broken bottles, chairs, frying pans, large rocks and broken branches.

**Unarmed** - This "weapon" includes punches, kicks, headbutts, bites and all manner of other combat without weapons. This applies to humanoid type creatures. Creatures with powerful jaws, horns or claws will all use the claw/bite weapons.

**Bite/Claw** - This can obviously be used for creatures with a bite or claw attack, but can also be used for tail bashes, stingers, horns and other natural weapons.

### Science Fiction Weapons

**Laser Pistol** - This weapon fires a pulse of laser light at the target. Able to be used with one hand, these weapons make an electronic "whoosh" when fired and use a power pack for ammo.

**Laser Rifle** - Similar to a laser pistol but requiring two hands to use and with a longer range, these weapons are often the armament of choice for professional soldiers and guards.

**Blaster Pistol** - This larger, heavier and more advanced version of the laser pistol fires more powerful pulses of laser light.

**Heavy Laser** - This large and heavy weapon is the laser equivalent of a machine gun, firing a veritable storm of laser pulses at the target. Like the bullet-firing variety, these weapons require either a special harness or brace, and are very difficult to use.

**Plasma Rifle** - This weapon fires a stream of super-heated plasma at the target. Although it does not have a long range, the gaseous nature of the plasma means it will not be stopped by armour unless it is fully sealed. (Non-sealed armour offers no protection at all against plasma).

**Fusion Pistol** - This pistol emits a beam of energy that causes small-scale nuclear fusion in the target. Due to the localised nature of the fusion, armour provides some reduction of effect. Damage rolls against any target not wearing armour will gain a bonus of +2 to the roll.

**Fusion Rifle** - A larger and heavier version of the fusion pistol, this weapon requires two hands to use.

**Stun Pistol** - This weapon fires a beam that interferes with the nervous system of a living target. Damage inflicted by this weapon should be recorded separately, and is recovered after 10 minutes of rest. This weapon cannot kill (the target is unconscious at 0 STAMINA). If a critical success is rolled, the weapon does double damage rather than critical effects.

**Freeze Beam** - This weapon fires an intense beam of cold at the target. If a 6 is rolled on the damage dice, the target will lose their next action, whether later in the same round or in the following round.

**Tractor Beam** - This weapon rarely causes any direct damage to the target. However, if the attack with this weapon succeeds, the user can push or pull the target one range category. This can be used on a target that is up to twice the weight of the weapon user.

**Chainsaw** - A powered cutting tool that can be used as a weapon. Requires fuel/power to operate.

**Force Sword** - An energy-based melee weapon that projects a blade of force. Requires power to function.

**Stun Rod** - A melee weapon that delivers an electrical shock to stun targets. Damage is recovered after rest, similar to stun pistols.

**Laser Sword** - An advanced melee weapon that projects a blade of coherent light. Requires power packs to operate.

**Energy Whip** - A flexible energy weapon that can strike at range. Requires power to function.

**Blast Rod** - A short-range energy weapon that delivers a concussive blast on impact.

## Special Rules

### Morning Star

The Morning Star has a modifier of -2 to the wielder's attack total due to its difficulty to use effectively.

### Polearm

If used in cramped conditions such as indoors or a dungeon, there will be a penalty of between -1 and -5, depending on just how cramped the conditions are.

### Two-Handed Weapons

Weapons that require two hands (Battle Axe, Greatsword, Polearm) cannot be used with a shield.

### Unarmed Combat

A Hero who is forced to fight with fists, knees, head, dagger, broken bottles, chair legs or other improvised weapons uses the Brawling Special Skill. In addition, if the Hero is facing an opponent who is armed with a weapon larger than a dagger, the Brawler suffers a -4 penalty to his combat score.

### Power-Packed Melee Weapons

Some higher-technology melee weapons also have an ammo rating and an ammo/slot. These weapons require power to function, although they only use one "shot" if the attack does damage. If a character wielding one of these weapons loses the combat round, they will not use an ammo charge. A weapon of this type that runs out of ammo will be treated as a club until reloaded, which takes 1 round as normal.

### Plasma Weapons and Armour

Plasma weapons ignore non-sealed armour completely. Only fully sealed armour (such as powered armour or space suits) provides protection against plasma weapons.

### Fusion Weapons

Fusion weapons gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls against targets not wearing armour.

### Stun Weapons

Stun weapons cannot kill - targets are rendered unconscious at 0 STAMINA. Stun damage is recovered after 10 minutes of rest. Critical successes with stun weapons deal double damage rather than critical effects.

## Combat Options

For detailed combat options and their rules, see [[RULES/Combat-Options|Combat Options]].

The combat options in this game are drawn from:

- **Advanced Fighting Fantasy 2nd Edition** - All Out Attack, Defensive Stance, Feint, Rapid Shot, and Push Back
- **Stellar Adventures** - Assist, Disarm, Hyperfire, and Long Shot

## Critical Hits and Fumbles

### Critical Hits

If a combat roll is a double 6, that combatant will automatically win that combat round regardless of combat totals. In addition, the blow is a critical hit and will inflict more damage. The winner makes their damage roll as normal, but the amount of damage that results from the table is doubled. Armour then applies as normal. The loser of that round must also reduce their current SKILL score by 1 due to muscle and bone damage.

If both combatants roll a double 6, then both will inflict double damage on each other, as both inflict devastating blows.

### Fumbles

If a combat roll is a double 1, that combatant has fumbled their weapon and will automatically lose that round regardless of the combat totals. In addition, the loser must roll 2D6 and find out the effect of the fumble on the following table. If both combatants roll double 1, then not only do both make rolls on the fumble table, but both weapons will also shatter in addition to any other effects. Magical weapons never shatter in this way.

| 2D6 | Fumble Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2 | Hero hits nearest ally (or self if no allies nearby) for double normal damage. An armour roll is allowed. |
| 3 | Hero hits himself, doing normal damage. An armour roll is allowed. |
| 4 | Hero leaves himself open. Opponent inflicts double damage with this attack. |
| 5 | Hero falls flat on his face. Character is at -4 for two rounds, then may attempt to get up (see 8) |
| 6 | Hero drops his weapon. It will take 2 full rounds to recover that weapon. |
| 7 | Hero slips and is off balance. A -2 penalty applies to all physical actions on the next turn. |
| 8 | Hero falls. One full round must be spent getting up during which no other action can be taken. |
| 9 | Hero's weapon is thrown beyond enemies. This weapon may not be reclaimed until after the fight. |
| 10 | Hero exposes weak spot to enemy. Hero may not have an armour roll against this attack. If Hero does not have armour, attack has +2 to the damage roll. |
| 11 | Hero hits nearest ally (or self if no allies nearby) for normal damage. Armour roll is allowed. |
| 12 | Hero hits himself, doing double damage. An armour roll is allowed. |
