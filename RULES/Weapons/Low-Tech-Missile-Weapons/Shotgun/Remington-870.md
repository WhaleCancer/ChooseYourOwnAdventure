## Suggested Variations

**Reliability:** The 870's reputation for reliability could reduce fumble chances or grant a bonus in adverse conditions (wet, dirty, cold).

**Versatility:** The 870 can accept different barrel lengths and chokes. Could allow for different range modifications or grant bonuses with specific ammunition types.

**Police/Military Issue:** The 870's widespread use by law enforcement could grant a bonus to intimidation rolls when brandished, or reduce penalties when used in tactical situations.

**Durability:** The 870's robust construction means it can take abuse. Could reduce the chance of weapon damage or allow the weapon to function in conditions that would disable cheaper shotguns.
