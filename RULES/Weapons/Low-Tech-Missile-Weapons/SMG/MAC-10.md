The MAC-10 is the iconic submachine gun of British Columbia's criminal underworld, particularly associated with biker gangs and organized crime. In the 1980s, the MAC-10 became the weapon of choice for biker gangs due to its compact size, high rate of fire, low cost, and ease of concealment. The weapon's distinctive appearance and reputation for being used in drive-by shootings and criminal activities have made it a symbol of organized crime in the region. The MAC-10 features a very high rate of fire (over 1,000 rounds per minute), making it devastating at close range but difficult to control. Its compact design makes it easy to conceal under clothing or in vehicles, perfect for bikers who need a weapon that can be quickly accessed and used. The weapon's low cost and availability on the black market made it accessible to criminal organizations, and its association with biker culture has made it an iconic symbol of the criminal underworld in British Columbia.

## Suggested Variations

Here are some ways to differentiate the MAC-10 from other SMGs:

**High Rate of Fire:** The MAC-10's extremely high rate of fire makes it devastating at close range. Could grant bonuses to damage or hit rolls at Very Short range, or allow for suppressive fire effects.

**Poor Accuracy:** The high rate of fire and compact design make the MAC-10 difficult to control. Could impose penalties to accuracy at the outer edge of Short range, or require skill checks to maintain control during sustained fire.

**Concealability:** The compact design makes it easy to hide. Could grant bonuses to concealment checks, or allow the weapon to be more easily carried in vehicles or under clothing.

**Iconic Reputation:** The MAC-10's association with biker gangs and organized crime is well-known. Could grant bonuses to intimidation rolls when brandished, or create recognition among criminal elements and law enforcement.

**Low Cost:** The MAC-10 is relatively affordable on the black market. Could be more commonly available among criminal organizations, or cost less to acquire than more expensive SMGs.

**Biker Association:** The weapon's iconic status with biker gangs could grant bonuses to social interactions within criminal circles, or create complications with law enforcement who recognize it as a weapon of choice for organized crime.
