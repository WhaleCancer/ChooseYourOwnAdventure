The Walther PPK is a compact semi-automatic pistol popular with civilians, private investigators, bodyguards, and individuals who need a concealable sidearm. In British Columbia, the PPK would be encountered with private security personnel, wealthy civilians, private investigators, and occasionally with organized crime figures who value its compact size and reliability. The PPK's primary advantage is its small size and ease of concealment, making it ideal for backup weapons or situations where discretion is important. The pistol features excellent ergonomics for its size and a reputation for reliability, though its compact frame can make it more difficult to control during rapid fire compared to full-size pistols.

## Suggested Variations

Here are some ways to differentiate the PPK from other pistols:

**Concealability:** The PPK's compact size makes it easier to hide. Could grant a bonus to concealment checks or reduce the chance of being detected when carrying concealed.

**Backup Weapon:** Often carried as a secondary weapon. Could allow drawing and firing in the same round, or grant a bonus when switching to this weapon.

**Close Quarters:** The compact size makes it easier to use in tight spaces. Could grant a +1 bonus to combat rolls in cramped conditions or when grappling.

**Reduced Recoil:** The smaller frame can be harder to control. Could impose a -1 penalty to combat rolls when firing multiple shots in rapid succession, or reduce effectiveness at longer ranges within the Short range category.
