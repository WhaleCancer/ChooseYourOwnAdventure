The Browning High Power (also known as the Hi-Power or P35) was manufactured in Canada by John Inglis and Company during World War II. The Canadian-produced version was used by Canadian and British forces, and production continued post-war. In British Columbia, the Browning High Power would be encountered with Canadian military personnel, RCMP officers, and civilians who own this popular and reliable 9mm pistol. The High Power's primary advantage is its 13-round magazine capacity, significantly higher than most contemporary pistols and revolvers, allowing for sustained fire without frequent reloading. The pistol also features excellent ergonomics and a reputation for reliability. It was one of the most widely used military pistols of the 20th century and remains popular with collectors and shooters.

## Suggested Variations

Here are some ways to differentiate the High Power from other pistols:

**Ammo Capacity:** The 13-round magazine is the primary advantage. Could allow for more sustained fire or grant a bonus when using the Rapid Shot combat option.

**Faster Reload:** Semi-automatic pistols reload faster than revolvers. Could reduce reload time from 1 round to a free action, or allow reloading as part of another action.

**Better at Medium Range:** The High Power's design and 9mm cartridge perform well at slightly longer ranges. Could extend effective range to Medium, or grant a +1 bonus to combat rolls at Short range.

**Ergonomic Advantage:** The High Power's grip and balance make it easier to control. Could grant a +1 bonus to combat rolls when firing multiple shots in a round, or reduce penalties for moving and shooting.
