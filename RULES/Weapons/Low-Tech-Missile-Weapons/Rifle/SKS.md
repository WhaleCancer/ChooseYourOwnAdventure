The SKS is a Soviet-designed semi-automatic carbine that was widely exported and manufactured in many countries. In British Columbia, the SKS would be encountered with criminals, organized crime figures, biker gangs, and anyone who needs a cheap but effective semi-automatic rifle. The SKS was popular in Canada due to its low cost, reliability, and the availability of 7.62×39mm ammunition. The weapon features a fixed internal magazine that is loaded using stripper clips, making it slower to reload than rifles with detachable magazines, but the design is simple and reliable. The SKS's reputation for reliability, its low cost, and its effectiveness at medium ranges made it a popular choice for criminals and those who needed a combat-capable rifle without the expense or legal complications of military weapons. Many SKS rifles in Canada have been modified with aftermarket stocks, scopes, or other accessories.

## Suggested Variations

Here are some ways to differentiate the SKS from other rifles:

**Reliability:** The SKS design is known for reliability. Could reduce fumble chances, or grant bonuses in adverse conditions (wet, dirty, cold).

**Low Cost:** The SKS is an affordable option. Could be more commonly available, or cost less to acquire than more expensive rifles.

**Stripper Clip Loading:** The fixed magazine is loaded with stripper clips. Could impose penalties to reload speed, or require specific equipment (stripper clips) to reload efficiently.

**Modification Potential:** Many SKS rifles are modified. Could allow for stock modifications, scope mounts, or other customizations that affect handling, accuracy, or appearance.

**Criminal Association:** The SKS's popularity with criminals could grant penalties to social interactions when the weapon is visible, or create recognition among law enforcement.
