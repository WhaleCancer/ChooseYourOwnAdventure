The C1A1 is the Canadian version of the FN FAL battle rifle, manufactured under license by Canadian Arsenals Limited. In British Columbia, the C1A1 would be encountered with Canadian military personnel, particularly those serving in the Canadian Armed Forces. The C1A1 was the standard-issue rifle for the Canadian military from the 1950s through the 1980s, and while it was being phased out in favor of the C7 in the late 1980s, many units still used the C1A1. The weapon fires the powerful 7.62×51mm NATO round, making it effective at longer ranges than smaller-caliber rifles. The C1A1 features selective fire capability (semi-automatic and fully automatic), though automatic fire is typically restricted. The weapon's reliability, power, and long-range effectiveness made it a trusted choice for military service, though its weight and recoil can be challenging for some users.

## Suggested Variations

Here are some ways to differentiate the C1A1 from other rifles:

**Power and Range:** The 7.62×51mm round is powerful and effective at longer ranges. Could grant bonuses to damage at Medium/Long range, or increase effective range compared to smaller-caliber rifles.

**Military Issue:** The C1A1 is a military weapon. Could grant bonuses to intimidation rolls when brandished, or create recognition among military personnel.

**Weight and Recoil:** The C1A1 is heavier and has more recoil than smaller-caliber rifles. Could impose penalties to mobility or require higher strength to use effectively, or grant bonuses to those with military training.

**Reliability:** The FN FAL design is known for reliability. Could reduce fumble chances, or grant bonuses in adverse conditions (wet, dirty, cold).
