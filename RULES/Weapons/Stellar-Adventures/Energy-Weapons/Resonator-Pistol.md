# Resonator Pistol

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

A unique, and patented, weapon, the Resonator Pistol from SPW creates a blue beam between the pistol and the target. This beam sets up a high-energy state in the target (or their armour) which causes disruption to the armour itself, damage to body tissues and can reduce flesh to a semi-liquid pulp. The weapon has been banned by numerous planets due to the horrific effects of a hit.
