# Sonic Disruptor

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This specialist weapon is only effective against living beings, and only those that can hear sounds. SPW have produced a weapon that focuses a high intensity beam of sound purely at the target. Although little physical damage is caused to the target, the auditory nerves and brain centres are overwhelmed and the target is disoriented. In addition, targets are often deafened for some time after.
