# MkV P-Laser

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This light laser pistol from Glassfleet uses an innovative system to adapt the Stokes Shift of the laser module to increase the damage whilst reducing power consumption. The weapon is therefore smaller than would be expected with a uniquely high power output. The MkV can also be fired in a "low power" mode to cause pain and minor injury rather than kill, further prolonging the already impressive power pack life.
