# Shard Laser Carbine

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This short laser rifle is light and relatively small and is popular with drop-troops, marines and others for whom space is limited. The Shard Jet-pack troopers use this weapon and it has proved similarly popular with other light troops. The light weight and short length does reduce both magazine capacity and operational range.
