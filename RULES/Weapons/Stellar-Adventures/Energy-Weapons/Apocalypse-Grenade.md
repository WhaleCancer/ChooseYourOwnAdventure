# Apocalypse Grenade

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

The Apocalypse at last gives everyone the opportunity to own a mini-weapon of mass destruction. When activated and thrown, the grenade causes an eruption of ultra-high temperature plasma. Under some circumstances, this blast is able to set up a chain reaction, pushing the plasma on and out. In testing, our maximum blast radius was 124 miles!
