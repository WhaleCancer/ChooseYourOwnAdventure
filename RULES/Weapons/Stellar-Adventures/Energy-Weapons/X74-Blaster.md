# X74 Blaster

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This classic weapon has been in production for over fifty years and has seen service in far too many gunfights to count. Although an older design, this weapon is still a solid piece of ordnance and well worth every credit it costs. Frost still ship out many of these on a daily basis and the tough design means they rarely malfunction.
