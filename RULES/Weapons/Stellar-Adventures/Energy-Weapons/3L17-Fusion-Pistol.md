# 3L17 Fusion Pistol

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

Meteor technologies designed this sidearm for Mercenaries or Soldiers who needed to pack a real punch in an emergency. Like all fusion weapons, the pistol has a chance of inflicting minimal damage, especially if the target is wearing any sort of protection. However, against unarmoured targets, it can inflict far more damage than its size would suggest, literally melting flesh from bones.
