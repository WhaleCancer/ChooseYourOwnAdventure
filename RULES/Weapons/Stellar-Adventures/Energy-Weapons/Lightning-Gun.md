# Lightning Gun

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

Building upon the success of their Flux Beamer, SPW re-used the phase inverter and linked it to a high-energy ion driv unit to create a small lightning creator. When the trigger is pulled, an ionic link is created between the gun and the target between which a lightning bolt shoots. It is impossible to shoot a target through a glass window for example, but also makes it very easy to hit.
