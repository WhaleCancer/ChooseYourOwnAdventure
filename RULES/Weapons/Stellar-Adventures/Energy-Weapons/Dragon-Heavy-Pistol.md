# Dragon Heavy Pistol

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This weapon packs more of a punch than a standard laser due to the amplifier unit incorporated into the barrel. The low price point of the weapon (Frost Armaments) means that many infantry regiments carry a 'Dragon' as a sidearm to compliment their standard weaponry. Although not as resilient as some other brands, the Dragon is a powerful weapon at a low price.
