**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

One of our own techs created this after a visit to a museum, wherein were displayed ancient pots and dishes made of baked clay. Ceramics have come a long way since those primitive days, and this is the epitome. Created from advanced ceramics with very few metallic parts, it is able to produce a powerful beam whilst being undetectable, heat resistant and very, very tough.
