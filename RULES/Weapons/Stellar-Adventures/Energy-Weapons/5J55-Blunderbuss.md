Produced and designed by Meteor Technologies (the commercial arm of the Blazing Comet Mercenary Company), the 5J55 Blunderbuss fires a cluster of small and discrete laser bursts across a conical area. Although the individual damages are fairly low and the range short, the weapon is able to strike multiple adjacent enemies at the same time and is sometimes used as a riot gun.
