# Pistol Two

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

Following on from the good sales of the Pistol One from Ootian Cooperative Industries (they are strangely poor at naming) we can also offer the "Pistol Two". Our own technicians are unable to explain how the focusing arrays and beam generator work, but this is a top notch blaster equal to anything else in our catalogue.
