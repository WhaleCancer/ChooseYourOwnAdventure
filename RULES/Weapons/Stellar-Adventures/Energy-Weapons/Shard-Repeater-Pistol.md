# Shard Repeater Pistol

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

Although this weapon is small and the individual laser bolts low powered, the rapid bolt generation allows the wielder to spray bolts in a large area at a rapid rate. This allows the pistol to be used as an enemy suppression weapon as well as for crowd control, much in the same way as a larger shotgun would. This weapon is often carried by Shard troopers on peacekeeping duties.
