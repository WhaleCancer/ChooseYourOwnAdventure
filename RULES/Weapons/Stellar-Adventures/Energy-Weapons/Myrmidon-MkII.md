# Myrmidon MkII

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

Castlebridge Industries revised their original, very popular, Myrmidon physical grenade launcher to an energy-grenade which increases the range, reduces the recoil and provides greater reliability. The MkII retains the original severe styling but is some 23% lighter making it more useful for extended deployments. The Myrmidon can fire an energy bolus equal to a standard grenade.
