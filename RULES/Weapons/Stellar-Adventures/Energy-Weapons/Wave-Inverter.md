# Wave Inverter

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This weapon from SPW is a low power version of the Flux Beamer, their most successful weapon. Retaining the phase inverter but without the gas injector or power coil, this weapon creates a lesser effect but with far lower power drain (and cost). This weapon is a popular choice as a sidearm for its reliability and striking looks.
