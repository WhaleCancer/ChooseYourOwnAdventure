# Lightning Dueller

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

These weapons were first made for the nobility of Stirk VII. The upper classes of that planet had a penchant for settling disputes with pistol duels. The Frost Armaments team designed this weapon with an ergonomic grip and sensitive trigger to enable faster firing times. Following the civil war caused by the early deaths of most of the governing classes, the weapon was made available to everyone.
