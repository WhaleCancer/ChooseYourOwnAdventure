# Plasma Cannon

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

The channeling of a burst of ionic particles through a high intensity electromagnet creates a bolus of plasma at significant speed. Although the pistol itself appears to be designed by the less lucid kind of mad scientist, this SPW Cannon is a highly effective weapon of its kind. This weapon is produced in very small quantities and must be ordered specially from the manufacturers.
