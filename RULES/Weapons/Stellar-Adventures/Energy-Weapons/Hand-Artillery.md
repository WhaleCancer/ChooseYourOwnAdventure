# Hand Artillery

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

CI designed this Hand Artillery as a support weapon for infantry units. The range is long, the damage high and the powerpack large. The weapon is of course heavy and difficult to use, and many operators utilise a gyro-harness to stabilise and support the weapon during firing. This weapon is a potent support weapon but creates significant noise and heat and is not a subtle choice.
