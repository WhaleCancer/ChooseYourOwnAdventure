# Flux Beamer

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This intriguing weapon from SPW uses a unique power coil, phase inverter and rare gas injector to project a power flux at a nearby enemy. Although necessarily of short range, the power flux has the potential to cause great damage, especially to anyone wearing armour which itself creates a harmful power field around the wearer.
