# Pistol Four

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

The final offering from OCI is their version of a Plasma Pistol. The power magazine is small and the range limited compared to our other catalogue items of similar type, but the damage is very good and the pistol very easy to use and maintain. The styling may still be archaic, but no-one can doubt the performance and quality of this weapon.
