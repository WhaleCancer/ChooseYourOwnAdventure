# Pistol Three

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

Pistol Three was the natural successor to the excellent previous offering from Ootian Cooperative Industries. This light pistol has a loop trigger and glowing green and red components (we haven't worked out what they do yet) and is a very good light laser pistol indeed, suitable for everyday wear as well as battle use. Try it, you will be surprised.
