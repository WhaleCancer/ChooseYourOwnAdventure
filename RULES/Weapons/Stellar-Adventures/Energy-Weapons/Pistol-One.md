# Pistol One

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

When we were approached by an agent from the primitive Ootian people, offering us a pistol for sale, we politely declined with a smile on our faces. When we tested it however, we got them straight back in. It may look like something our cave-dwelling ancestors used, but boy does it pack a punch! The laser beam is coherent and powerful and the weapon light and easy to use.
