# SO23 Electrolaser

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

This interesting addition to the SCT range was primarily designed for planetside security forces. Using a highly modulated laser beam, this weapon can short-circuit the nervous system of almost any being, inflicting pain and even unconsciousness without causing lasting damage. These electrolaser pulses do still pose a threat to shipboard systems however so we do not recommend its use on a starship.
