# Dual Blaster

**Source:** Stellar Adventures Weapons and Armour Catalogue

The unique styling of SPW weapons is embodied in the Dual Blaster. The old-fashioned control dials and the angular construction hide the effectiveness of this unique weapon. Although the dual barrels exert a great strain on the powerpack, the twin bolts inflict high damage. The range must be set before firing however so the twin beams will converge at the correct point.
