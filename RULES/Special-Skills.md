# Skills

Skills are areas that the Character has specialised in. Any points in a Skill are added to PHYSICAL or MENTAL when checking for success. They are grouped for convenience into 4 main areas: Combat, Movement, Stealth, and Knowledge. Combat and Movement Skills add to a Character's PHYSICAL for that specific test, while Stealth and Knowledge Skills add to the Character's MENTAL.

A skill of 1 point indicates someone who has had basic training, 2 points indicates fully trained, 3 points can be considered an expert, and 4 or more a master.

## Creating New Skills

If the provided list is insufficient, players and Directors are encouraged to create new or more specialized skills. All kinds of things that a person can do can become Skills, and not all professions can be covered by the existing skills.

**Guidelines for adding new skills:**
- It's best to discuss the proposed skill with the Director and the rest of the gaming group, as it might affect the game.
- Players should consider the utility of the skill in the context of the game's challenges.
- The skill's capabilities must be carefully examined to ensure it doesn't unbalance the game.
- Players and the Director must agree on what the new skill can and cannot do.
- Notes should be made for future reference.
- Ultimately, the Director's decision is final.
