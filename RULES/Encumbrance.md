## Encumbrance

In the logging towns, ferry terminals, and rain‑slick back alleys of 1985 British Columbia, people haul all kinds of gear—shotguns and tackle boxes, camera cases, strange samples from the woods, and evidence bags the RCMP will never officially log. Even so, a Character cannot carry everything. Rather than tracking exact weights, this game uses an **abstract encumbrance system** based on how many item‑slots a character can reasonably manage.

### Basic Capacity

- A Character may normally carry **10 Normal items**.  
- For every **2 full points** in the **PHYSICAL** characteristic, or for every **1 full point** in the **Strength** special skill, the Character may carry **+1 additional Normal item**.  
- **Worn clothing, basic footwear, and an empty backpack or shoulder bag** do not count against this limit. Everything else carried or worn does.

### Item Size Categories

Items are grouped into four broad categories:

- **Very Small**  
  - Tiny objects like pills, coins, single bullets, small baggies, lighters, keys.  
  - **Up to 100 Very Small items** count as **1 Normal item**. Track in bundles if you prefer.

- **Small**  
  - Bundles of tiny things, small pouches, a compact tool, a small bottle or can.  
  - **About 10 Small items** count as **1 Normal item** (or decide quiver‑style groupings to taste).

- **Normal**  
  - Typical personal gear: a handgun, a full bottle, a crowbar, a walkman and tapes, a satchel of gear.  
  - Each Normal item counts as **1 item** against the 10‑item limit.

- **Large / Very Large**  
  - Two‑handed weapons, large crates, full backpacks, cases of bottles, bulky armor.  
  - A **Large** item counts as **2 Normal items**; a **Very Large** item counts as **3 or more**, at the GM’s discretion.

### Encumbered Characters

- If a Character is carrying **more than their item limit**, they are **Encumbered**:
  - Move at **half normal movement rate**—trudging up logging roads, along waterfronts, or through tight apartment stairwells.  
  - Are treated as carrying a **very heavy load** for any relevant skill or characteristic tests (climbing slick rocks, swimming in cold inlets, sprinting between parked cars, sneaking through mill yards, etc.).  
  - A Character may never carry **more than double** their normal allowance—beyond this, it is simply impossible without vehicles, sleds, boats, or other assistance.

## Drug Encumbrance and 1985 CAD Values

The table below assigns each drug entry a **standard carried unit**, an **encumbrance category** for that unit, and a **typical 1985 CAD street value**. Prices are ballpark and can vary by city, purity, and who the PCs buy from.

### Using Drug Encumbrance in Play

- **Most personal‑use quantities of drugs are Very Small** and only affect encumbrance in large numbers.  
- Dealers, smugglers, and stash houses may carry **multiple units** or larger containers (kilos, crates, cases), which the GM should treat as **Normal, Large, or Very Large** items depending on size.  
- For quick play, you can assume a typical PC can carry **all their personal drugs in 1 Normal item slot** unless they are hauling crates, kilo bricks, or cases of alcohol.
