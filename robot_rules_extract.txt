found in medium tech settings and type 5’s are found only
in high tech settings.
Of course, it is entirely possible to have an
otherwise high tech setting with no robots at all,
or a low tech campaign with advanced Type 5
simulants. As with all other setting details, the
Director must decide.
Type I
These robots are very basic indeed. They are
programmed for one specific task such as
cleaning, wall repair or firefighting. They have
no intelligence and will not respond to events
outside their specific design. This means that a
firefighting robot can adapt to the changing
nature of a burning building, targeting water
and foam at the hottest places, and so on.
However, if this same robot comes under attack,
it will not even know it (except if a flamethrower
is used!) and will certainly not respond.
Type II
Type II robots are a significant advance on Type
1’s but are still basic. They are more adaptable,
and can be considered to have rank 2 in an
appropriate special skill. They are also able to
respond with insect-level intelligence to events
outside their speciality. Type II robots are often
used as mechanics, farm workers, animal
handlers etc.
Type III
These are multipurpose robots with a range of
related skills. Roles such as servant, general
home robot or general repairbot are common
for this type. These robots often have a basic
pseudo-intelligence to deal with people as part
of their work.
