# Toyota Hilux Technical (Machine Gun)

**Type:** Improvised fighting vehicle / Technical  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Mobile warfare, hit-and-run tactics, convoy escort, area denial

## Overview

A Toyota Hilux pickup truck converted into an improvised fighting vehicle by mounting a machine gun in the bed. This configuration became famous during conflicts like the Chad Toyota War (1987), where light, mobile technicals defeated heavier armored forces through speed, maneuverability, and surprise. The technical combines the Hilux's legendary reliability and agility with sustained firepower, creating a highly effective mobile weapons platform.

## Weapon Options

Choose one machine gun for the bed mount:

### Light Machine Gun (C9, PKM, or equivalent)
- **Damage:** As per weapon stats
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed or magazine-fed
- **Notes:** Lighter, more mobile, easier to reload on the move

### General Purpose Machine Gun (C6, FN MAG, or equivalent)
- **Damage:** As per weapon stats  
- **Range:** Long
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Heavier firepower, better range, requires more stable firing position

### Heavy Machine Gun (DShK, M2, or equivalent)
- **Damage:** As per weapon stats (typically higher)
- **Range:** Long
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Anti-vehicle capability, devastating against light armor and personnel

## Modules

- **Extra Ammunition Storage [1 Slot, 500Cr]:** Additional ammo boxes secured in bed for sustained fire.
- **Gunner Shield [1 Slot, 1,000Cr]:** Light metal or improvised shield protecting gunner from small arms (provides Light Armour to gunner only).
- **Reinforced Mount [1 Slot, 500Cr]:** Heavy-duty weapon mount reducing recoil and improving accuracy (+1 to vehicle-mounted weapon attacks).

## Tactical Use

The Technical (Machine Gun) excels at:

- **Hit-and-run attacks** - Fast approach, deliver fire, rapid withdrawal
- **Mobile fire support** - Providing covering fire while moving
- **Convoy escort** - Protecting supply lines and transport
- **Area denial** - Controlling key routes and chokepoints
- **Anti-personnel** - Devastating against infantry and unarmored vehicles

## Combat Considerations

- **Gunner Exposure:** The gunner is exposed in the bed; they have no cover except the cab (partial) and any gunner shield module
- **Mobility:** The vehicle's speed and agility allow it to engage and disengage quickly
- **Stability:** Firing on the move is difficult; driver should slow or stop for accurate fire
- **Ammunition:** Belt-fed weapons provide sustained fire but require reloading; plan for ammo resupply
- **Target Priority:** Effective against personnel, light vehicles, and unarmored targets

## In Play

The Technical (Machine Gun) serves as:

- **Mobile weapons platform** - Fast, agile fire support vehicle
- **Asymmetric warfare** - Light vehicle capable of engaging heavier forces
- **Convoy protection** - Escort and security for transport operations
- **Rapid response** - Quick deployment of firepower to key locations
- **Tactical flexibility** - Can engage or withdraw based on threat level

### Game Considerations

- The technical's speed and maneuverability make it difficult to target
- The exposed gunner is vulnerable to return fire; use hit-and-run tactics
- Effective against infantry and light vehicles; struggles against heavy armor
- Requires coordination between driver and gunner for maximum effectiveness
- The vehicle's unremarkable appearance (when weapon is covered) allows for surprise attacks
- Perfect for scenarios inspired by the Chad Toyota War where mobile technicals defeated heavier forces
