# Toyota Hilux Technical (Anti-Tank)

**Type:** Improvised fighting vehicle / Technical  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Anti-vehicle warfare, tank hunting, mobile anti-armor platform

## Overview

A Toyota Hilux pickup truck converted into an anti-tank fighting vehicle by mounting an anti-tank weapon in the bed. This configuration became legendary during conflicts like the Chad Toyota War (1987), where light technicals armed with anti-tank guided missiles and rocket launchers successfully engaged and destroyed much heavier Libyan armored vehicles. The combination of the Hilux's speed and agility with dedicated anti-armor weapons creates a highly effective tank-hunting platform.

## Weapon Options

Choose one anti-tank weapon for the bed mount:

### Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launcher (RPG-7 or equivalent)
- **Damage:** As per RPG/Launcher stats (full damage vs vehicles)
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Single-shot, reloadable
- **Notes:** Simple, reliable, effective against most vehicles; requires reloading after each shot

### Anti-Tank Guided Missile (MILAN, TOW, or equivalent)
- **Damage:** As per Guided Missile Launcher stats (high damage vs vehicles)
- **Range:** Long
- **Ammo:** Single-shot, requires reload
- **Notes:** Wire-guided or IR-guided; requires lock-on but devastating against armor

### Recoilless Rifle (M40, SPG-9, or equivalent)
- **Damage:** As per RPG/Launcher stats (full damage vs vehicles)
- **Range:** Medium-Long
- **Ammo:** Single-shot, reloadable
- **Notes:** More accurate than RPG, better range, but heavier and more complex

## Modules

- **Extra Ammunition Storage [1 Slot, 500Cr]:** Additional rockets/missiles secured in bed for sustained operations.
- **Gunner Shield [1 Slot, 1,000Cr]:** Light metal or improvised shield protecting gunner from small arms (provides Light Armour to gunner only).
- **Reinforced Mount [1 Slot, 500Cr]:** Heavy-duty weapon mount reducing recoil and improving accuracy (+1 to vehicle-mounted weapon attacks).
- **Stabilization System [1 Slot, 1,500Cr]:** Hydraulic or mechanical stabilization for firing on the move (allows firing while moving at reduced accuracy).

## Tactical Use

The Technical (Anti-Tank) excels at:

- **Tank hunting** - Engaging and destroying armored vehicles
- **Ambush tactics** - Surprise attacks on convoys and armored columns
- **Mobile anti-armor** - Rapid deployment of anti-tank capability
- **Hit-and-run** - Fast approach, fire, rapid withdrawal
- **Asymmetric warfare** - Light vehicle capable of defeating much heavier opponents

## Combat Considerations

- **Gunner Exposure:** The gunner is exposed in the bed; they have no cover except the cab (partial) and any gunner shield module
- **Mobility:** The vehicle's speed and agility allow it to engage and disengage quickly
- **Firing Position:** Anti-tank weapons typically require the vehicle to stop for accurate fire; guided missiles require lock-on time
- **Ammunition:** Limited ammunition capacity; each shot counts, plan for resupply
- **Target Priority:** Effective against vehicles and armor; overkill against personnel
- **Backblast:** Rocket launchers and recoilless rifles have dangerous backblast areas

## Historical Context

During the Chad Toyota War (1987), Chadian forces used Toyota Hilux technicals armed with MILAN anti-tank guided missiles to devastating effect against Libyan T-55 tanks and BMP armored vehicles. The technicals' speed, mobility, and ability to fire and move quickly allowed them to engage and destroy much heavier Libyan forces, demonstrating the effectiveness of light, mobile anti-tank platforms.

## In Play

The Technical (Anti-Tank) serves as:

- **Tank hunter** - Specialized anti-armor vehicle
- **Asymmetric warfare** - Light vehicle capable of engaging heavy armor
- **Mobile firepower** - Rapid deployment of anti-tank capability
- **Convoy ambush** - Effective for ambushing armored columns
- **Tactical flexibility** - Can engage or withdraw based on threat level

### Game Considerations

- The technical's speed and maneuverability make it difficult for heavy vehicles to target
- The exposed gunner is vulnerable to return fire; use hit-and-run tactics
- Effective against vehicles and armor; requires careful positioning and timing
- Limited ammunition means each shot must count; plan engagements carefully
- The vehicle's unremarkable appearance (when weapon is covered) allows for surprise attacks
- Perfect for scenarios inspired by the Chad Toyota War where mobile technicals defeated heavier forces
- Anti-tank weapons deal full damage to vehicles (not halved like standard weapons)
