# Plymouth Gran Fury (1985 Police Cruiser)

**Type:** Police cruiser  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Police patrol vehicle, taxi

## Overview

The Plymouth Gran Fury is a full-sized automobile manufactured by Plymouth since 1975. The nameplate would be used on successive downsizings, first in 1980, and again in 1982, through what would originally have been intermediate and compact classes in the early 1970s, all with conventional rear-wheel drive layouts. They are Chrysler's last remaining rear-wheel drive cars, with a V8 and carburetor, a configuration used since the mid-1950s.

This imposing, steel-bodied sedan is a mainstay in police fleets and Canadian taxi stands in the 1980s. Featuring a sturdy frame, V8 power, bench seating, and police package upgrades, it was a common sight in every BC city, town, and stretch of Highway 1. The Gran Fury can take a beating, cruise all night, and haul passengers or suspects in comfort (if sheer roominess counts as comfort).
