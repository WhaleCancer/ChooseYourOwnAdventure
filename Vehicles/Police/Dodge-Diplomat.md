# Dodge Diplomat (1985 RCMP Cruiser)

**Type:** Police cruiser  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** RCMP patrol vehicle

## Overview

The Dodge Diplomat was a staple of Canadian police fleets in the early to mid-1980s, highly similar in role and construction to the Plymouth Gran Fury. Compact for a North American "full-size" V8, with lean lines, a tough frame, and a no-nonsense bench seat. The RCMP depended on its simplicity, cheap parts, and good city handling for urban and rural patrol alike.
