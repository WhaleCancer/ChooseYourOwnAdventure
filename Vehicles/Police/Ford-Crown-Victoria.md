## In Play

The Crown Victoria serves as:

- **Standard RCMP interceptor** - Common police cruiser in 1985 British Columbia
- **Highway patrol vehicle** - Fast enough for pursuit and interception
- **Transport vehicle** - Room for multiple officers or prisoners
- **Symbol of authority** - Recognizable police presence

### Game Considerations

- The Crown Victoria is a common police vehicle, making it standard in law enforcement encounters
- The V8 provides enhanced performance for chase sequences
- The large size and visibility make it less suitable for undercover operations
- Police modifications provide tactical advantages but also mark it as an official vehicle
- The conspicuousness of police vehicles affects investigation difficulty—larger, more obvious vehicles are easier to detect
