## Vehicles in EPIC

This folder holds **individual vehicle entries** used in the setting—specific bikes, vans, boats, and aircraft that matter to the story (PC rides, iconic faction vehicles, recurring NPC transports, etc.).

Mechanical rules for how vehicles work at the table—Armour, STAMINA, damage from weapons, and generic types—are defined in `[RULES: Vehicles](./RULES/Vehicles.md)`. Each note in this folder should:

- Name the vehicle and give its **type** (e.g. Pickup Truck, Motorcycle, Fishing Boat, Box Truck).  
- Specify which **generic profile** from `RULES/Vehicles` it uses (Motorcycle, Sedan, Pickup Truck, Fishing Boat, etc.).  
- Mention **who owns it** (PC, NPC, faction) and **what it’s used for** (smuggling, patrols, mobile lab, personal ride).  
- List any **small tweaks** from the generic profile (e.g. extra concealed compartment, slightly better off‑road performance, unusual paint job that affects attention).

Example structure for a vehicle entry:

- **Name:** “East End Chapter Convoy Bike”  
- **Type / Profile:** Motorcycle (see `RULES/Vehicles`)  
- **Owner / Faction:** Hells Angels – East End chapter  
- **Use:** Lead bike in drug convoys and intimidation runs through East Vancouver.  
- **Notes:** Custom Harley big‑twin with chapter colours; saddlebags sized for a shotgun or SMG. Treat as standard Motorcycle, but any appearance of this bike gives a **+1 bonus to Intimidation** checks against locals who know the patch.

You can now create one note per important vehicle under `Vehicles/` following this pattern, linking back to the generic rules.
