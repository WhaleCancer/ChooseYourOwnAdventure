# Harvester (UFO)

**Type:** Alien spacecraft / Livestock harvesting vehicle  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

A flying saucer designed for the harvesting of non-human creatures, particularly cattle and other livestock. These sorts of vessels are associated with the [[Phenomena/Cattle-Mutilations|Cattle Mutilation]] phenomenon.

## Characteristics

- **Livestock specialized** - Designed for harvesting animals, not humans
- **Surgical equipment** - Advanced tools for precise organ removal
- **Sample collection** - Facilities for collecting biological samples
- **Stealth operations** - Designed to avoid detection during operations
- **Efficient processing** - Quick and precise mutilation operations

## Typical Operations

- **Cattle mutilations** - Harvesting specific organs from livestock
- **Biological sampling** - Collecting samples from animals
- **Genetic research** - Gathering material for genetic experiments
- **Environmental monitoring** - Tracking animal populations
- **Stealth operations** - Conducting operations without detection

## Connection to Cattle Mutilations

The Harvester is directly connected to:

- **[[Phenomena/Cattle-Mutilations|Cattle Mutilations]]** - The primary vehicle for mutilation operations
- **Surgical precision** - The clean cuts and specific organ removal
- **No tracks** - The lack of evidence at mutilation sites
- **Bloodless operations** - The absence of blood at crime scenes

## In Play

Harvesters serve as:

- **Cattle mutilation scenarios** - The primary vehicle for mutilation operations
- **Investigation targets** - Craft to be tracked, intercepted, or captured
- **Evidence** - Physical proof of alien livestock operations
- **Combat encounters** - Engaging mutilation operations
- **Rural settings** - Operations in remote agricultural areas

### Game Considerations

- Harvesters provide a unique focus on animal rather than human operations
- The surgical precision creates a sense of advanced technology
- The connection to cattle mutilations ties into classic X-Files phenomena
- The stealth operations make them difficult to detect
- The rural settings create opportunities for isolated investigation scenarios
