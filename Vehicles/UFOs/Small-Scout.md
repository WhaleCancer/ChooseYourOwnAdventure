# Small Scout (UFO)

**Type:** Alien spacecraft / Reconnaissance vehicle  
**Era:** Active in 1985

## Overview

The **Small Scout** is a single-pilot UFO meant for taking sensor readings (and readings from implants). It is the smallest and most common type of alien craft encountered, typically used for reconnaissance, monitoring, and individual abduction operations.

## Characteristics

- **Single Pilot** - Operated by one Grey (typically a Navigator or Technician)
- **Reconnaissance** - Designed for sensor readings and monitoring
- **Implant Monitoring** - Can read signals from alien implants in abductees
- **Stealth** - Small size makes it difficult to detect
- **Maneuverability** - Highly agile for evasive maneuvers

## Typical Operations

- **Sensor Readings** - Monitoring environmental conditions, energy signatures, or other data
- **Implant Monitoring** - Tracking individuals with alien implants
- **Reconnaissance** - Scouting locations before larger operations
- **Individual Abductions** - Taking single individuals for examination
- **Surveillance** - Monitoring human activity or specific locations

## In Play

Small Scouts serve as:

- **Reconnaissance encounters** - First contact with alien craft
- **Abduction scenarios** - Individual abduction operations
- **Surveillance** - Monitoring player characters or locations
- **Evidence** - Physical proof of alien activity
- **Combat encounters** - Small-scale engagements with alien craft

### Game Considerations

- Small Scouts are the most commonly encountered UFO type
- Their single-pilot design makes them vulnerable but agile
- The connection to implant monitoring creates ongoing threats
- Their reconnaissance role suggests larger operations may follow
- The small size makes them difficult to detect or intercept
