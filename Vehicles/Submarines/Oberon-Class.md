# Oberon-Class Submarine

**Type:** Submarine / Naval vessel  
**Era:** 1985 (entered service 1965-1968)  
**Use:** Naval operations, training, potential paranormal investigation

## Overview

The **Oberon class** was a ship class of 27 British-designed submarines operated by five nations. They were designed as a follow-on from the Porpoise class; physical dimensions were the same but stronger materials were used in hull construction and improved equipment was fitted.

The three Canadian submarines were built with improved air-conditioning systems, while as many common components as possible were replaced with Canadian equivalents. The Canadian Oberons used United States Navy torpedoes throughout their career: they were initially equipped with Mark 37 torpedoes, but were later upgraded for the Mark 48s.

## Canadian Acquisition

Beginning in 1957, Canada began looking at acquiring submarines to replace the training 6th Submarine Division provided by the Royal Navy at Halifax, Nova Scotia. A proposal was submitted to the Canadian Chiefs of Staff in November 1959 affirming the need for a Canadian submarine service and to incorporate the acquisition of the subs into the fleet renewal plan of the late 1950s.

In March 1962, Cabinet recommended the purchase of three Oberons and eight frigates, on the condition that the cost of acquiring the submarines from the United Kingdom would be offset by British defence purchases in Canada. It was also supplemented by Balao-class submarine trainer HMCS Grilse S-71 (former USS Burrfish SS-312) beginning in 1961.

The final price of $40 million for the entire contract was agreed upon in 1963.

## Canadian Modifications

All three boats received modifications to the original Oberon design, which included:

- **Enlargement of the snort de-icer** - Improved surface operations
- **Different weapons fit** - US Navy torpedoes (Mark 37, later Mark 48)
- **Larger air conditioning unit** - Improved crew comfort
- **Active sonar** - Enhanced detection capabilities
- **Different communications equipment** - Canadian systems

The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room to make room for the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew.

## Canadian Submarines

The three boats were given First Nations names:

- **HMCS Ojibwa** (formerly Onyx) - Entered service 23 September 1965
- **HMCS Onondaga** - Entered service 22 June 1967
- **HMCS Okanagan** - Entered service 22 June 1968

## In Play

Oberon-class submarines serve as:

- **Naval assets** - Canadian military submarines for training and operations
- **Deep-sea operations** - Potential encounters with [[Factions/Corporations/Parabys|Parabys]] operations or deep-sea phenomena
- **Investigation platforms** - Potential use for investigating underwater UFO activity
- **Military support** - Naval support for M-EPIC or other operations
- **Strategic assets** - Important military vessels with classified capabilities

### Game Considerations

- Oberon-class submarines provide naval capabilities for the setting
- The deep-sea operations create opportunities for encounters with Parabys or underwater phenomena
- The First Nations names add Canadian cultural elements
- The classified nature creates opportunities for secret operations
- The connection to US Navy torpedoes suggests international cooperation
