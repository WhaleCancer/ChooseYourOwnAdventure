# M113 Armored Personnel Carrier

**Type:** Armored personnel carrier  
**Era:** 1960s-present (Canadian service 1960s-2000s)  
**Use:** Troop transport, fire support, command vehicle, ambulance

## Overview

The M113 is an American-designed tracked armored personnel carrier that has been one of the most widely used military vehicles in history. The Canadian Armed Forces adopted the M113 in the 1960s, and by 1985 it was the standard APC for mechanized infantry units. The M113 provides basic armor protection and can be configured with various weapons, from machine guns to TOW anti-tank missiles. While more versatile than the BTR-60, the M113 shares similar vulnerabilities to light armor and anti-tank weapons.

- Provides anti-tank capability

### M113 Command Post
- Enhanced radio and communication equipment
- Command and control vehicle

### M113 Ambulance
- Medical module installed
- Used for casualty evacuation

## Characteristics

The M113 is known for:

- **Versatility** - Multiple configurations for different roles
- **Amphibious** - Can cross water obstacles without preparation
- **Tracked Mobility** - Good cross-country performance
- **Light Armor** - Aluminum armor protects against small arms but vulnerable to heavier weapons
- **High Troop Capacity** - Can transport full infantry squad
- **Modular Design** - Easy to configure for different missions

## Comparison to BTR-60

**Advantages over BTR-60:**
- Tracked mobility provides better off-road performance
- More versatile with multiple configurations
- Can mount TOW missiles for anti-tank capability
- Better cross-country mobility

**Similar Vulnerabilities:**
- Very light armor (Armour 1)
- Vulnerable to heavy machine guns and RPGs
- Open troop compartment exposes dismounting infantry
- Large target profile

## Historical Context

The M113 served with the Canadian Armed Forces from the 1960s through the 2000s, seeing extensive use in training and operations. While more capable than the BTR-60 in many ways, it would face similar challenges against mobile technicals. The M113's light armor makes it vulnerable to machine gun fire and RPGs, though its tracked mobility and optional TOW launcher give it more tactical flexibility.

## In Play

The M113 serves as:

- **Standard Canadian APC** - Primary troop transport for mechanized infantry
- **Versatile platform** - Multiple configurations for different missions
- **Fire support** - Machine gun or TOW launcher provides covering fire
- **Vulnerable to technicals** - Light armor makes it susceptible to machine guns and RPGs
- **Better than BTR-60** - Tracked mobility and versatility provide advantages

### Game Considerations

- The M113's very light armor (Armour 1) provides minimal protection against heavy weapons
- Tracked mobility provides better off-road performance than wheeled APCs
- Optional TOW launcher provides anti-tank capability but requires stopping to fire
- High troop capacity makes it valuable for transport but creates a large, vulnerable target
- Dismounting troops are exposed to fire when leaving the vehicle
- More versatile than BTR-60 but shares similar vulnerabilities
- Represents standard Canadian mechanized infantry capability in 1985
- Can be used for comparison scenarios or as player-accessible military assets
