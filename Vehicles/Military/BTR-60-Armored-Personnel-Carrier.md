# BTR-60 Armored Personnel Carrier

**Type:** Armored personnel carrier  
**Era:** 1960s-1980s (Libyan service in 1980s)  
**Use:** Troop transport, reconnaissance, light fire support

## Overview

The BTR-60 is a Soviet-designed eight-wheeled armored personnel carrier that was widely exported and used by Libyan forces. Unlike the BMP-1, the BTR-60 is a traditional APC focused on transporting troops rather than fighting alongside them. It provides light armor protection and machine gun firepower but lacks the heavy weapons of an IFV. During the Chad Toyota War (1987), BTR-60s were used for troop transport and reconnaissance but proved vulnerable to Chadian technicals armed with machine guns and RPGs.

## Weapons

### 14.5mm KPVT Heavy Machine Gun
- **Damage:** As per heavy machine gun stats (higher than standard MG)
- **Range:** Long
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Effective against light vehicles and personnel; can damage technicals

### 7.62mm PKT Machine Gun (Alternative)
- **Damage:** As per machine gun stats
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Lighter option, less effective against vehicles

## Modules

- **Additional Ammunition [1 Slot]:** Extra machine gun ammunition for sustained fire.
- **Infantry Equipment Storage [1 Slot]:** Storage for dismountable troops' weapons and equipment.
- **Radio Equipment [1 Slot]:** Enhanced communication equipment for command and control.

## Characteristics

The BTR-60 is known for:

- **High Troop Capacity** - Can transport 14 dismounted troops
- **Wheeled Mobility** - Fast on roads, good for reconnaissance
- **Light Armor** - Protects against small arms but vulnerable to heavier weapons
- **Open Troop Compartment** - Troops exposed when dismounting
- **Limited Firepower** - Machine gun only, no anti-tank capability
- **Amphibious** - Can cross water obstacles

## Vulnerabilities

The BTR-60's weaknesses include:

- **Very Light Armor** - Vulnerable to heavy machine guns, RPGs, and anti-tank weapons
- **Open Troop Compartment** - Troops exposed to fire when dismounting
- **Limited Firepower** - Machine gun only, cannot engage heavy vehicles effectively
- **Poor Off-Road Mobility** - Wheeled design struggles in soft terrain
- **Large Target** - High profile makes it easy to spot and hit

## Historical Context

During the Chad Toyota War (1987), Libyan BTR-60s were used for troop transport and reconnaissance but proved highly vulnerable to Chadian technicals. The BTR-60's light armor offered little protection against heavy machine guns, and the vehicle's limited firepower meant it could not effectively engage technicals at range. Chadian forces could use their technicals' speed and mobility to outmaneuver BTR-60s, engaging them with machine guns and RPGs from multiple angles.

## In Play

The BTR-60 serves as:

- **Troop transport** - Carries large numbers of dismountable troops
- **Reconnaissance** - Fast, wheeled mobility for scouting operations
- **Light fire support** - Machine gun provides covering fire
- **Vulnerable to technicals** - Light armor makes it highly susceptible to machine guns and RPGs
- **Amphibious operations** - Can cross water obstacles

### Game Considerations

- The BTR-60's very light armor (Armour 1) provides minimal protection against heavy weapons
- The machine gun is effective against personnel but struggles against armored vehicles
- High troop capacity makes it valuable for transport but creates a large, vulnerable target
- Dismounting troops are exposed to fire when leaving the vehicle
- Wheeled mobility provides speed on roads but limits off-road capability
- The vehicle's limited firepower means it must rely on dismounted troops for heavy combat
- Perfect for scenarios demonstrating the vulnerability of light APCs to mobile, well-armed opponents
- Can be easily destroyed or disabled by technicals with machine guns or RPGs
