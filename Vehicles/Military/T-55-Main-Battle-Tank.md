# T-55 Main Battle Tank

**Type:** Main battle tank  
**Era:** 1950s-1980s (Libyan service in 1980s)  
**Use:** Armored warfare, breakthrough operations, heavy fire support

## Overview

The T-55 is a Soviet-designed main battle tank that became one of the most widely produced tanks in history. By the 1980s, it was exported to numerous countries including Libya, where it formed the backbone of their armored forces. During the Chad Toyota War (1987), Libyan T-55s were engaged by Chadian forces using Toyota Hilux technicals armed with anti-tank guided missiles. Despite their heavy armor and firepower, the T-55s proved vulnerable to mobile, agile opponents who could exploit their slow turret traverse, limited visibility, and poor mobility in desert conditions.

## Weapons

### 100mm D-10T Main Gun
- **Damage:** 8 (column 1-6), 9 (column 7+) - Devastating anti-tank and anti-structure weapon
- **Range:** Very Long
- **Ammo:** 43 rounds (HE, AP, HEAT)
- **Notes:** Slow reload (loader required), slow turret traverse, requires stopping to fire accurately

### 7.62mm PKT Coaxial Machine Gun
- **Damage:** As per machine gun stats
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Anti-personnel weapon, fires alongside main gun

## Modules

- **Additional Ammunition [1 Slot]:** Extra main gun rounds stored in hull (increases ammo capacity by 10 rounds).
- **Smoke Launchers [1 Slot]:** Smoke grenade launchers for concealment and retreat.
- **Infrared Searchlight [1 Slot]:** IR searchlight for night operations (rare on export models).

## Characteristics

The T-55 is known for:

- **Heavy Armor** - Thick steel armor designed to resist anti-tank weapons
- **Powerful Main Gun** - 100mm cannon capable of destroying most vehicles
- **Low Profile** - Relatively small silhouette for a main battle tank
- **Poor Mobility** - Slow, heavy, struggles in soft terrain and sand
- **Limited Visibility** - Crew has poor situational awareness, especially to sides and rear
- **Slow Turret Traverse** - Vulnerable to fast-moving opponents

## Vulnerabilities

The T-55's weaknesses include:

- **Slow Turret Traverse** - Cannot quickly engage fast-moving targets
- **Poor Mobility** - Struggles in desert sand and soft terrain
- **Limited Visibility** - Crew cannot see threats approaching from sides or rear
- **Vulnerable to Modern ATGMs** - Armor insufficient against guided missiles like MILAN
- **High Profile** - Despite low profile, still large target
- **Mechanical Reliability** - Older design, maintenance intensive

## Historical Context

During the Chad Toyota War (1987), Libyan T-55 tanks were repeatedly defeated by Chadian Toyota Hilux technicals armed with MILAN anti-tank guided missiles. The technicals' speed and mobility allowed them to engage the tanks from multiple angles, exploiting the T-55's slow turret traverse and limited visibility. The T-55's heavy armor proved insufficient against modern guided missiles, and the tanks' poor mobility in desert conditions made them easy targets for mobile opponents.

## In Play

The T-55 serves as:

- **Heavy firepower** - Devastating main gun capable of destroying most targets
- **Armored breakthrough** - Heavy armor allows advancing under fire
- **Intimidation** - Presence of tanks creates psychological impact
- **Vulnerable to mobile opponents** - Slow, predictable, vulnerable to hit-and-run tactics
- **Poor in asymmetric warfare** - Struggles against fast, agile technicals

### Game Considerations

- The T-55's heavy armor (Armour 4) provides significant protection but is vulnerable to anti-tank weapons
- The main gun deals devastating damage but requires the vehicle to stop and aim
- Slow turret traverse means fast-moving targets can outmaneuver the tank
- Poor mobility makes the T-55 vulnerable in soft terrain and desert conditions
- Limited crew visibility creates blind spots that mobile opponents can exploit
- Perfect for scenarios where heavy, conventional forces face light, mobile opponents
- The tank's presence creates dramatic tension but demonstrates vulnerability to asymmetric tactics
