# BMP-1 Infantry Fighting Vehicle

**Type:** Infantry fighting vehicle / Armored personnel carrier  
**Era:** 1960s-1980s (Libyan service in 1980s)  
**Use:** Mechanized infantry transport, fire support, anti-tank operations

## Overview

The BMP-1 is a Soviet-designed infantry fighting vehicle that combines troop transport capability with significant firepower. Unlike traditional APCs that only transport troops, the BMP-1 is designed to fight alongside dismounted infantry, providing fire support with its 73mm main gun and anti-tank guided missile. During the Chad Toyota War (1987), Libyan BMP-1s were deployed alongside T-55 tanks but proved similarly vulnerable to mobile Chadian technicals. The BMP-1's lighter armor and open troop compartment made it even more vulnerable than tanks to anti-tank weapons and machine gun fire.

## Weapons

### 73mm 2A28 Grom Main Gun
- **Damage:** 6 (column 1-5), 7 (column 6+)
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** 40 rounds (HE, HEAT)
- **Notes:** Low-velocity gun, effective against light vehicles and infantry; struggles against heavy armor

### 9M14 Malyutka (AT-3 Sagger) Anti-Tank Guided Missile
- **Damage:** 7 (column 1-6), 8 (column 7+)
- **Range:** Long
- **Ammo:** 4 missiles (reloadable)
- **Notes:** Wire-guided, requires operator to guide missile to target; slow but effective against armor

### 7.62mm PKT Machine Gun
- **Damage:** As per machine gun stats
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Coaxial machine gun for anti-personnel use

## Modules

- **Additional ATGM Storage [1 Slot]:** Extra Malyutka missiles (increases capacity by 2 missiles).
- **Infantry Equipment Racks [1 Slot]:** Storage for dismountable infantry weapons and equipment.
- **Smoke Launchers [1 Slot]:** Smoke grenade launchers for concealment.

## Characteristics

The BMP-1 is known for:

- **Dual Role** - Both transports infantry and provides fire support
- **Amphibious** - Can cross water obstacles without preparation
- **Significant Firepower** - Main gun and ATGM provide anti-vehicle capability
- **Light Armor** - Protects against small arms but vulnerable to anti-tank weapons
- **Open Troop Compartment** - Infantry vulnerable to fire when dismounting
- **Better Mobility** - Faster and more agile than tanks

## Vulnerabilities

The BMP-1's weaknesses include:

- **Light Armor** - Vulnerable to machine guns, RPGs, and anti-tank weapons
- **Open Troop Compartment** - Dismounting infantry are exposed to fire
- **Slow ATGM Guidance** - Operator must guide missile manually, vulnerable during guidance
- **Limited Main Gun Effectiveness** - Low-velocity gun struggles against heavy armor
- **Mechanical Complexity** - More systems to maintain than simple APCs

## Historical Context

During the Chad Toyota War (1987), Libyan BMP-1s were deployed alongside T-55 tanks but proved vulnerable to Chadian technicals. The BMP-1's lighter armor made it more susceptible to machine gun fire and RPGs than tanks, and the open troop compartment meant dismounting infantry were exposed. Chadian technicals could engage BMP-1s with machine guns to suppress the vehicle and infantry, then use anti-tank weapons to destroy the vehicle itself.

## In Play

The BMP-1 serves as:

- **Mechanized infantry transport** - Carries and supports dismountable infantry
- **Fire support** - Provides covering fire for dismounted troops
- **Anti-vehicle capability** - ATGM allows engaging heavier vehicles
- **Vulnerable to technicals** - Light armor makes it susceptible to machine guns and RPGs
- **Amphibious operations** - Can cross water obstacles

### Game Considerations

- The BMP-1's light armor (Armour 2) provides protection against small arms but is vulnerable to heavier weapons
- The main gun is effective against light vehicles and infantry but struggles against heavy armor
- The ATGM provides anti-tank capability but requires the operator to guide it manually
- Dismounting infantry are exposed to fire when leaving the vehicle
- Better mobility than tanks but still vulnerable to fast, mobile opponents
- The dual role (transport + fire support) makes it versatile but complex
- Perfect for scenarios where mechanized forces face mobile, asymmetric opponents
