# Grizzly Armored Personnel Carrier

**Type:** Wheeled armored personnel carrier  
**Era:** 1980s-present (Canadian service from 1983)  
**Use:** Troop transport, reconnaissance, patrol, fire support

## Overview

The Grizzly is a Canadian-designed 6x6 wheeled armored personnel carrier based on the Swiss MOWAG Piranha. Entering Canadian service in 1983, the Grizzly was part of Canada's move toward wheeled armored vehicles for better strategic mobility and lower maintenance requirements. The Grizzly provides light armor protection and can mount various weapons from machine guns to automatic grenade launchers. While faster on roads than tracked vehicles, the Grizzly shares the vulnerability of light armor to anti-tank weapons.

## Characteristics

The Grizzly is known for:

- **Wheeled Mobility** - Fast on roads, good for strategic mobility
- **Light Armor** - Protects against small arms but vulnerable to heavier weapons
- **Versatile Weapons** - Can mount machine guns or grenade launchers
- **Lower Maintenance** - Wheeled design requires less maintenance than tracked vehicles
- **Strategic Mobility** - Can be easily transported by aircraft or ship
- **Limited Off-Road** - Struggles in soft terrain compared to tracked vehicles

## Comparison to BTR-60

**Advantages over BTR-60:**
- More modern design with better ergonomics
- Can mount automatic grenade launcher for area effect
- Better strategic mobility (easier to transport)
- Lower maintenance requirements

**Similar Vulnerabilities:**
- Very light armor (Armour 1)
- Vulnerable to heavy machine guns and RPGs
- Open troop compartment exposes dismounting infantry
- Limited off-road capability

## Historical Context

The Grizzly entered Canadian service in 1983 as part of Canada's modernization of its armored vehicle fleet. The wheeled design reflected a shift toward vehicles optimized for strategic mobility and lower maintenance, while still providing basic protection and firepower. The Grizzly would face similar challenges to other light APCs when confronting mobile technicals, though its speed and modern design would provide some advantages.

## In Play

The Grizzly serves as:

- **Modern Canadian APC** - Represents 1985-era Canadian wheeled armored vehicle
- **Reconnaissance vehicle** - Fast, mobile platform for scouting operations
- **Patrol vehicle** - Good for road-based patrols and security operations
- **Vulnerable to technicals** - Light armor makes it susceptible to machine guns and RPGs
- **Better strategic mobility** - Easier to deploy than tracked vehicles

### Game Considerations

- The Grizzly's very light armor (Armour 1) provides minimal protection against heavy weapons
- Wheeled mobility provides excellent road speed but limits off-road capability
- Can mount automatic grenade launcher for area effect against personnel
- High troop capacity makes it valuable for transport but creates a large, vulnerable target
- Dismounting troops are exposed to fire when leaving the vehicle
- More modern than BTR-60 but shares similar vulnerabilities
- Represents Canadian move toward wheeled armored vehicles in 1985
- Can be used for comparison scenarios or as player-accessible military assets
- Perfect for demonstrating that even modern light APCs are vulnerable to mobile technicals
