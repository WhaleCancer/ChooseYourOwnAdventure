# Ferret Armored Car

**Type:** Light armored reconnaissance vehicle  
**Era:** 1950s-1980s (Canadian service 1950s-1980s)  
**Use:** Reconnaissance, patrol, light fire support

## Overview

The Ferret is a British-designed light armored car that served with the Canadian Armed Forces from the 1950s through the 1980s. A small, fast, wheeled reconnaissance vehicle, the Ferret was designed for scouting and patrol duties rather than heavy combat. By 1985, the Ferret was being phased out in favor of newer vehicles like the Grizzly, but it remained in service with some units. The Ferret's light armor and limited firepower make it highly vulnerable to modern threats, but its small size and speed provide some advantages for reconnaissance missions.

## Weapons

### 7.62mm C1 Machine Gun (Standard)
- **Damage:** As per machine gun stats
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Light machine gun; effective against personnel only

### .30 Caliber Browning (Alternative)
- **Damage:** As per machine gun stats
- **Range:** Medium
- **Ammo:** Belt-fed
- **Notes:** Older weapon system; similar performance to C1

## Modules

- **Additional Ammunition [1 Slot]:** Extra machine gun ammunition for sustained operations.
- **Radio Equipment [1 Slot]:** Enhanced communication equipment for reconnaissance reporting.
- **Reconnaissance Equipment [1 Slot]:** Binoculars, maps, and observation equipment.

## Characteristics

The Ferret is known for:

- **Small Size** - Compact design makes it hard to spot and hit
- **High Speed** - Fast, agile, excellent for reconnaissance
- **Minimal Armor** - Very light protection; vulnerable to all weapons
- **Limited Firepower** - Machine gun only; cannot engage armored targets
- **Reconnaissance Focus** - Designed for scouting, not combat
- **Obsolete by 1985** - Being phased out in favor of newer vehicles

## Vulnerabilities

The Ferret's weaknesses include:

- **Minimal Armor** - Vulnerable to all weapons, including small arms
- **Limited Firepower** - Machine gun only; cannot engage vehicles effectively
- **Small Crew** - Only two crew members; limited capabilities
- **Obsolete Design** - Outdated by 1985 standards
- **No Anti-Tank Capability** - Cannot engage armored vehicles

## Historical Context

The Ferret served with the Canadian Armed Forces from the 1950s through the 1980s, primarily in reconnaissance roles. By 1985, it was being replaced by newer vehicles like the Grizzly, but some units still operated Ferrets. The vehicle's light armor and limited firepower made it suitable only for reconnaissance and patrol duties in low-threat environments. Against modern threats like technicals, the Ferret would be highly vulnerable.

## Comparison to Technicals

**Advantages:**
- Better armor (minimal but present)
- Military-grade communications
- Trained crew

**Disadvantages:**
- Less firepower than technicals with heavy machine guns
- More expensive and complex
- Obsolete design
- Cannot engage armored targets

## In Play

The Ferret serves as:

- **Reconnaissance vehicle** - Fast, agile platform for scouting
- **Patrol vehicle** - Light security and observation duties
- **Obsolete equipment** - Represents older Canadian military vehicles
- **Highly vulnerable** - Minimal armor makes it easy target for technicals
- **Comparison point** - Demonstrates that even military vehicles can be outmatched

### Game Considerations

- The Ferret's minimal armor (Armour 0) provides almost no protection
- Small size and speed provide some advantages for reconnaissance
- Limited firepower means it cannot effectively engage technicals
- Obsolete by 1985, representing older military equipment
- Perfect for demonstrating that technicals can outmatch even military reconnaissance vehicles
- Can be used for comparison scenarios showing the evolution of military vehicles
- Useful for scenarios where players encounter older military equipment
- Shows that technicals with heavy weapons can defeat light military vehicles
