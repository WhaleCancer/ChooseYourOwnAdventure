# Volkswagen Golf Mk2 (1985)

**Type:** Compact hatchback  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Commuting, personal transportation, budget-friendly vehicle

## Overview

The Volkswagen Golf is a fuel-efficient, two- or four-door hatchback that's become a modern classic, popular in cities, college towns, and even the lower forest roads of BC. Fast enough for its size, sporty to drive, and with hatchback practicality, the Golf is beloved by adventurers on a budget, commuters, and anyone who needs to haul a surprising amount of camping or sports gear for its size.

**Note:** The Men in Black are usually pretty tall (NORDICS), so they get out of the car pretty comically. [Tall Man in Small Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBqVVbnZ1c)
