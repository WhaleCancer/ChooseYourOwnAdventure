# Chevrolet Astro (1985)

**Type:** Van / Film crew vehicle  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Film production, equipment transport, mobile base

## Overview

This is the film guys' car, it is the good guy version of the vanagon. A rugged, compact rear-wheel drive van with surprising interior space, the Astro hauls film crews and payloads to city streets, remote BC forests, or logging roads. Sliding side doors, rear twin doors, and flat floor make for quick loading and flexible configurations. Outfitted as a rolling equipment room or even a "mobile set base," it's a classic sight on any location shoot.
