# Bell 206L LongRanger

**Type:** Light helicopter  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Police, search and rescue, forestry, news, utility transport

## Overview

The Bell 206 is a family of two-bladed, single- and twin-engined helicopters, manufactured by Bell Helicopter at its Mirabel, Quebec, plant. Originally developed as the Bell YOH-4 for the United States Army's Light Observation Helicopter program, it was not selected by the Army. Bell redesigned the airframe and successfully marketed the aircraft commercially.

The **206L LongRanger** is a stretched variant with seating for seven. The fuselage, stretched a total of 30 inches (760 mm), adds two rear-facing seats between the front and rear seats. Since 1975, Bell has produced more than 1,700 LongRangers across all variant types.

## History

The Bell 206B was first introduced to the Canadian market shortly after its certification in 1967. Its early adoption was driven by the booming resource industries of the time, particularly in oil and gas exploration, mining, and forestry. Its light weight, combined with the ability to land in rugged, remote locations, made it an ideal tool for transporting geologists, surveyors, and equipment to otherwise inaccessible areas of Canada's vast wilderness.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the JetRanger became a critical part of exploration in northern Canada, including the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Arctic regions, where harsh weather conditions and rough terrain demanded a helicopter that could perform in all environments. The Bell 206B's durability and low operating cost also made it a favorite for these long, sometimes dangerous missions.
