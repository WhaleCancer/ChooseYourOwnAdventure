# Boeing CH-47D Chinook (1985)

**Type:** Heavy-lift helicopter  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Military transport, disaster relief, heavy cargo operations

## Overview

The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is a tandem-rotor helicopter originally developed by American rotorcraft company Vertol and now manufactured by Boeing. The Chinook is an advanced, multi-mission helicopter used to transport equipment and personnel during domestic or deployed operations. Its name, Chinook, is from the Native American Chinook people of Oregon and Washington state.

The CH-47D is the latest version. On loan from the Canadian Army.

A legendary tandem-rotor transport helicopter, the Chinook can haul troops, heavy equipment, vehicles, or perform mass rescues in even the most rugged Canadian wilderness. Its dual engines and rotors ensure remarkable stability, power, and redundancy. Canada's military used it for Arctic, mountain, and flood operations, and it is sometimes called for the most demanding civilian disasters.
