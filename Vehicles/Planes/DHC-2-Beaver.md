# de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver

**Type:** Bush plane / STOL aircraft  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** Remote access, cargo transport, search and rescue, forestry

## Overview

The de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver is a single-engined high-wing propeller-driven short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft developed and manufactured by de Havilland Canada. It has been primarily operated as a bush plane and has been used for a wide variety of utility roles, such as cargo and passenger hauling, aerial application (crop dusting and aerial topdressing), and civil aviation duties.

The De Havilland Beaver is the definitive Canadian bush plane. Renowned for hauling people and cargo into wild areas, it's beloved by the RCMP, forestry service, surveyors, and trappers alike. Can be fitted with wheels, skis, or floats for all-terrain access. It's sturdy, simple, and typically operates far from civilization—if a plane can reach it, it's likely a Beaver.
