# Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow

**Type:** Interceptor aircraft  
**Era:** 1985 (resurrected after 1959 cancellation)  
**Use:** Military interceptor, NORAD operations

## Overview

The **Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow** is a delta-winged interceptor aircraft designed and built by Avro Canada. The aircraft has a troubled history, having been cancelled by one Canadian government and resurrected by a subsequent one.

## History

The Arrow was the culmination of a series of design studies begun in 1953 that examined improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from the production line, skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. 1, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.

Flight testing began with RL-201 on 25 March 1958, and the design quickly demonstrated excellent handling and overall performance, reaching Mach 1.9 in level flight. Powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75, another four Mk. 1s were completed. The lighter and more powerful Orenda Iroquois engine was soon ready for testing, and the first Mk 2 with the Iroquois, RL-206, was ready for taxi testing in preparation for flight and acceptance tests by RCAF pilots by early 1959.

Canada tried to sell the Arrow to the US and Britain, but no agreements were concluded.

On 20 February 1959, Prime Minister of Canada John Diefenbaker abruptly halted the development of both the Arrow and its Iroquois engines before the scheduled project review to evaluate the program could be held. Two months later the assembly line, tooling, plans, existing airframes, and engines were ordered to be destroyed. The cancellation was the topic of considerable political controversy at the time, and the subsequent destruction of the aircraft in production remains a topic for debate among historians and industry pundits. "This action effectively put Avro out of business and its highly skilled engineering and production personnel scattered".

> [!Danger] The Truth
> In fact, the entire development process went underground with the events of Shag Harbour. The Arrow program was secretly continued using technology recovered from the Shag Harbour UFO incident.

## Capabilities

The CF-105 is capable of **Mach 2 speeds** at altitudes exceeding **50,000 feet (15,000 m)** and is intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Force's (RCAF) primary interceptor into the 1980s and beyond. They are scheduled to start replacing McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo in anti-Soviet patrols and interdictions. It's Soviet counterpart is the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, while the American equivalent is the Convair F-106 Delta Dart.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic deviates from our world's history substantially. One way that might not be apparent, is that interceptor craft remain more important than dedicated air superiority fighters.

## Shag Harbour Connection

The Arrow's secret continuation is connected to the Shag Harbour UFO incident, where recovered alien technology was used to advance the aircraft's development. This connection suggests:

- **Alien technology** - Use of recovered UFO components or materials
- **Secret development** - Hidden continuation of the program
- **Advanced capabilities** - Enhanced performance from alien tech
- **Government conspiracy** - Cover-up of the program's true status

## Project WINTER HARVEST

In the late 1970s, as NORAD radars and Canadian Forces bases suffered increasing unexplained interference and "unknown air contacts"—and the U.S. waffled about sharing its most advanced fighters—Canadian defense strategists quietly dusted off the Arrow project. Under the code name **Project WINTER HARVEST**, a clandestine alliance of air force loyalists, former Avro engineers, and government scientists gathered in the labyrinthine vaults beneath CFB Kelowna's EGHQ, merging scavenged Arrow blueprints with radical new advances in radar, avionics, and power systems.

By 1984, two Avro Arrow Mark II airframes—designated **CF-110**—were secretly completed: one transported by truck through remote logging roads to a "hill-hangar" near Prince George, the other fitted with untested satellite uplinks and anti-electronic warfare pods and hidden near a hydroelectric dam for "cold cell" trials. Then, in March 1985, as U.S.-Canada diplomatic relations faltered and the Soviets staged long-range bomber incursions, the Arrow's resurrection became public: the Minister of Defense appeared on nationwide broadcasts flanked by AIRCOM brass and a gleaming, white Arrow, its red maple leaf roundel shining beneath studio lights.

By late 1985, three operational Arrows had entered service at select northern bases. Officially, they are tasked to intercept Soviet bombers. Field reports soon linked the Arrow's presence to wild swings in regional magnetics, sudden disappearances of Greys, and even the mysterious downing of a "fast-moving object" over the Yukon that December. The CF-110 Arrow—sleek, delta-winged, and more advanced than any North American fighter—is not just the backbone of Canada's air defense, but also a potent symbol of national pride.

> [!NOTE] Timeline
> In our timeline, the CF-18 Hornet entered service in 1982, becoming the main Canadian multi-role fighter. In this world's timeline, the CF-105 Avro Arrow did so instead. The rollout is delayed until 1985 and even then only a handful were built.

### Real Operations

By late 1985, three operational Arrows had entered service at select northern bases. Officially, they were tasked to intercept Soviet bombers, but in reality they became rapid-scramble assets for "anomalous incursions" tracked by [[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|ORION]]'s secret network. Field reports soon linked the Arrow's presence to wild swings in regional magnetics, sudden disappearances of Greys, and even the mysterious downing of a "fast-moving object" over the Yukon that December. The CF-110 Arrow—sleek, delta-winged, and more advanced than any North American fighter—became not just the backbone of Canada's air defense, but also a potent symbol of national pride and a secret bulwark against threats no one dared mention on the evening news.

### Avro Arrow Test Pilot Origin

This origin is for one of the elite half dozen test pilots who flew the original two prototypes. The press and public alike were stunned—was this a prototype, or the dawn of a new squadron? Aviation experts quickly realized the CF-110 outclassed the aging F-101s, with rumors swirling of engines "unlike anything previously reported" and "blanks in the logbooks" for mysterious, unsourced components. Auxiliary pilots whispered of navigation lights flickering in mathematical sequences, a faint singing during high-G maneuvers, and even episodes of "missing time" in the Mark II's cockpit.

## In Play

The Avro Arrow serves as:

- **Military asset** - Advanced interceptor for NORAD operations
- **Technology mystery** - Secret development using alien technology
- **Historical connection** - Link to Shag Harbour and UFO recovery
- **Government conspiracy** - Hidden program and cover-up
- **Combat encounters** - High-speed intercept missions

### Game Considerations

- The Arrow's secret continuation adds conspiracy layers
- The connection to Shag Harbour ties into UFO recovery
- The advanced capabilities suggest alien technology integration
- The government cover-up creates investigation opportunities
- The aircraft's role in NORAD operations connects to UFO tracking
