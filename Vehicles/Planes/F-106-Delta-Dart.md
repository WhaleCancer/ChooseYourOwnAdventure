# Convair F-106 Delta Dart

**Type:** Interceptor aircraft  
**Era:** 1985  
**Use:** NORAD air defense, UFO interception (US counterpart to CF-101)

## Overview

The **Convair F-106 Delta Dart** is an all-weather interceptor aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Convair. The F-106 was designed in response to the 1954 interceptor program. Envisioned as an imagined "Ultimate Interceptor", it was a development of the F-102 Delta Dagger, and commenced as the F-102B prior to being redesignated by the United States Air Force (USAF).

## Design

The F-106 was designed without a gun or provision for carrying bombs, instead carrying its **AIM-4 Falcon** air-to-air missiles within an internal weapons bay, its clean exterior was beneficial to supersonic flight. Major differences from the F-102 included the adoption of the more powerful Pratt & Whitney J75 turbojet engine, heavily redesigned air inlets along with a variable-geometry inlet duct to suit a wide range of supersonic speeds, application of the area rule to the fuselage shaping, and a general increase in size.

On 26 December 1956, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. After flight testing demonstrated lesser performance gains than anticipated, the USAF ultimately only ordered 350 of the planned 1,000 F-106s.

## Relationship to Canadian Aircraft

The F-106 Delta Dart is the American equivalent to the Canadian [[Vehicles/Planes/CF-101-Voodoo|CF-101 Voodoo]], while the Soviet counterpart is the [[Vehicles/Planes/MiG-25|Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]]. The [[Vehicles/Planes/Avro-Arrow|Avro Arrow]] was intended to replace the Voodoo in Canadian service.

## NORAD Operations

The F-106 operates under NORAD command for:

- **UFO interception** - Scrambling to intercept unidentified aircraft
- **Air defense** - Protecting North American airspace
- **Condition Violet** - Special protocols for mysterious radar contacts

## In Play

The F-106 Delta Dart serves as:

- **US interceptor** - American counterpart to Canadian CF-101
- **NORAD operations** - Joint US-Canada air defense
- **UFO interception** - Scrambling to intercept unidentified craft
- **Military asset** - Important air defense capability
- **Cross-border cooperation** - US-Canada military coordination

### Game Considerations

- The F-106's role in NORAD connects to UFO tracking and interception
- The American counterpart angle creates opportunities for cross-border scenarios
- The interceptor role makes it relevant for high-speed chase scenarios
- The connection to Condition Violet procedures ties into paranormal operations
- The relationship to Canadian aircraft creates comparison opportunities
