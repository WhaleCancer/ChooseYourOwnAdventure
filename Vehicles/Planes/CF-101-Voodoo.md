# McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo

**Type:** Interceptor aircraft  
**Era:** 1961-1984 (being replaced in 1985)  
**Use:** NORAD air defense, UFO interception

## Overview

The **McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo** was an all-weather interceptor aircraft operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Forces between 1961 and 1984. They were manufactured by the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri for the United States Air Force (as F-101s), and later sold to Canada. CF-101s replaced the obsolete Avro CF-100 Canuck in the RCAF's all-weather fighter squadrons.

The CF-101s were retired in the 1980s and replaced with McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighters. However, in 1985, some Voodoos may still be in service or reserve status.

## Armament

The Voodoo's primary armament was **nuclear AIR-2A Genie** unguided air-to-air rockets, and there was significant political controversy in Canada about their adoption. Although they never fired a weapon in wartime, the CF-101 served as Canada's primary means of air defence from Quick Reaction Alert facilities at Canadian airbases.

### Secondary Armament

- **AIM-4D Falcon** - Air-to-air missiles (secondary armament)

## Nuclear Weapons Controversy

The issue of nuclear weapons in Canada had not been resolved in June 1961, thus the CF-101s were initially armed only with their secondary AIM-4D Falcon missiles. In April 1963, the issue led to the collapse of the Diefenbaker government. The succeeding Pearson government signed an agreement with the United States concerning nuclear arms for Canada on 16 August 1963.

The agreement did not actually state that Canada was acquiring nuclear weapons; the Canadian government usually refused to confirm or deny that there were any nuclear arms in Canada. The agreement specifically stated that the AIR-2A Genie rockets were the property of the United States and would only be released to Canada for actual use with the joint agreement of Canada and the United States through NORAD.

The stringent training requirements meant that it took until June 1965 for the Genies to become operational in Canada. The Genies were kept in the custody of the USAF, with detachments of the 425th Munitions Support Squadron located at each of the Canadian bases.

## NORAD Operations

The CF-101 served as Canada's primary means of air defence from Quick Reaction Alert facilities at Canadian airbases, operating under NORAD command. This includes:

- **UFO interception** - Scrambling to intercept unidentified aircraft
- **Condition Violet** - Special protocols for mysterious radar contacts
- **Air defense** - Protecting Canadian airspace from threats

## In Play

The CF-101 Voodoo serves as:

- **NORAD interceptor** - Primary air defense aircraft for Canada
- **UFO interception** - Scrambling to intercept unidentified craft
- **Military asset** - Important air defense capability
- **Political element** - Nuclear weapons controversy
- **Historical context** - Being replaced by CF-18 Hornets

### Game Considerations

- The Voodoo's role in NORAD connects to UFO tracking and interception
- The nuclear weapons angle adds political complexity
- The retirement/replacement creates transition period opportunities
- The connection to Condition Violet procedures ties into paranormal operations
- The interceptor role makes it relevant for high-speed chase scenarios
