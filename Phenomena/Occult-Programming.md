# Occult Programming

**Type:** Phenomenon / Mass manipulation technique  
**Era:** Ongoing since the 1970s

## Overview

Alleged "Occult Elites"—a covert alliance of bureaucrats, wealthy media barons, and elements of high clergy—act as middlemen for the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) (Archons). Their power thrives at the intersection of mass communication, ritual, and psychological manipulation. Rather than open control, they saturate mass culture with symbols and patterns that gradually rewrite the public's psychic and spiritual defenses, making humanity ever easier to manipulate, pacify, and—ultimately—"harvest."

## Mechanisms and Methods

### 1. Ritual Infiltration of Media

- Broadcast media, advertising, and children's programming are seeded with hidden codes: spiraling sigils, mathematically improbable triangle clusters, flickering "golden-robed" figures spliced into frame-by-frame edits.
- Jingles, theme tunes, and newscaster sign-offs contain anomalous word patterns, subtly hypnotic cadences, or reversed sound bites. Some viewers notice, but shrug it off as a "weird urban legend."
- News tickers and subliminal lower-thirds occasionally display phrases ("AWAKENING BEGINS," "OBEY," "THE DOOR OPENS") for fractions of a second—"just a glitch," the anchors say.

### 2. Synchronized Ritual Broadcasts

- On specific dates (occult alignments, solstices), coordinated broadcasts air the same intrusive symbols across multiple networks—sometimes disguised as charity telethons, sometimes as "emergency tests."
- Those sensitive to the occult (psychics, children, mentally ill) experience headaches, lost time, or vivid dreams after prolonged exposure; a small subset develop brief psychic "windows," during which they glimpse golden-robed figures whispering from behind the TV static.

### 3. Designed Viral Memes

- Children's cartoons and cereal mascots begin to play out stories implicitly glorifying self-sacrifice, groupthink, or servitude to hidden masters.
- Social fads, catchphrases ("Tune in & Forget!" "Let Them In!"), and ad slogans spread with viral speed, promoted by magazine covers, morning DJs, and brightly-colored school posters.
- Attempts to decipher or slow the spread are met with baffling denials or rapid cancellation of "problematic" staff.

### 4. Psy-Op "Don't Look" Reflex

- Official channels and opinion shapers insist there's "nothing there." Conspiracy-minded or intuitive citizens are gaslit into doubting their perceptions, or shamed for noticing.
- The mantra: "It's just a logo. It's just a cartoon. Don't be silly—this is modern life!" Questioning is swiftly associated with paranoia, mental illness, or backwardness.

## Societal Effects

- **Mass Conditioning:** Large swaths of the population slowly lose the urge to question, rebel, or even ponder their own reality. Protests, strikes, and spiritual awakenings fizzle out, replaced with listlessness and dependence on routine.
- **Hidden Trauma:** Children exposed to the densest programming develop sleepwalking, repressed memories, or draw spiral eyes and triangle motifs compulsively. A teen in every town mutters broadcast slogans in their dreams.
- **Splintering of Resistance:** Would-be whistleblowers, musicians, and artists attempting to subvert the pattern are blacklisted, institutionalized, or experience sudden runs of bad luck—some find strange, spiral-marked envelopes slipped under their doors as warnings.

## Hooks & Encounters

1. **Videotape Analysis:** A conspiracy radio host tasks the PCs with acquiring master tapes of a controversial Saturday morning cartoon. Under spectral analysis, the tapes reveal every 17th frame contains flashing spiral sigils and distorted, mind-manipulating humanoid faces. Attempts to bring this to light result in coordinated media denials and attacks from "concerned parents' groups."

2. **Live Broadcast Ritual:** The PCs intercept plans for a synchronised New Year's Eve "charity show" engineered by the Occult Elite. The show's schedule, when mapped onto a grid of city power substations, forms a massive occult symbol. The agents must disrupt the broadcast before a psychic "harvesting" wave sweeps through the population.

3. **Sigil Hunt:** Elders in a First Nations community report that local teens are dazed and listless, muttering sponsorship jingle lyrics and drawing triangles on all surfaces. The PCs find television antennae and billboards adorned with fresh, golden spiral graffiti, paired with an uptick in Greys' abduction activity.

4. **Occult Producer:** A tabloid news leak reveals that a reclusive network producer is a cultist tied to a secret lodge. PCs must infiltrate his masked gala (filled with spiral motifs and "triangle eye" guests) to learn how programming is chosen, and possibly plant "counter-signals" of their own.

## Sample NPC/Flavor Rumors

- "Pay attention to the commercials—they're always triangles, everywhere you look. I saw a face in the ketchup ad last week. I haven't slept since."
- "My kids only draw spirals now. Every day. They hum that cereal song constantly, even in their sleep."
- "The anchor said something under her breath—backwards—just before the news went to static. I listened to the tape. She whispered, 'The master wakes.'"
- "Heard the bishop had a 'brand new vision' after the Christmas broadcast. Replaced half the choir with folks that never blink at all."

## Television as Long-Term Mind Control Weapon

Since the end of World War II, the Archons have been conducting **Operation: Tranquil Channel**—a decades-long project to subdue humanity through carefully-engineered television content. Each decade brings new mind-numbing weapons, with the 1980s representing the "zombification apex" where the population is primed for maximum passivity.

### The Evolution of TV Mind Control (1945-1985)

**Late 1940s–1950s: The Conditioning Launch**
- Content: Stodgy variety shows, black-and-white family sitcoms, endless quiz shows
- Archon Tactic: Establish TV as a trusted, central "window" to the world; reward conformity, suppress risk-taking

**1960s–1970s: Saturation Phase**
- Content: Mass-produced crime procedurals, countless laugh-track sitcoms, corny local Canadian fare, cartoons with moral messages
- Archon Tactic: Deepen reliance. Increase volume and availability. Saturate afternoon and evening with undemanding entertainment. Begin "softer brains through softer shows" policy

**1980s (Prime Era): The Zombification Apex**
- **Game Shows:** "Definition" (Canadian), "The Price Is Right," "Wheel of Fortune"—repetitive, mind-numbing content that erases free will
- **Sitcoms:** "Three's Company," "The Littlest Hobo," "The Beachcombers"—safe, repetitive shows that disable logic centers
- **Infomercials & Home Shopping:** Late-night dominance, looping product promises that dull ambition
- **Archon Tactic:** Amplify repetition; ensure every day feels like the last. Use ubiquitous catchphrases, jingles, and theme songs to crowd out self-reflection. Canadian content rules (CanCon) enforce extra blandness—BC gets double-dosed with mild-mannered programming

### BC-Specific TV Programming (1980-1985)

**Game & Variety Shows:**
- **"Definition" (Canadian; 1974–1989):** Super low-budget, endless puns, aired in syndication on CTV. Eternal groan-worthy word puzzles sap cognitive drive
- **"The Price Is Right" (US):** Aired daily, Bob Barker's endless calls of "Come on Down!" and flashing lights. Viewers get stuck in a fugue state
- **"Wheel of Fortune" (US):** Letter flipping, constant spinning, vacant smiles. Ceaseless spins erase free will
- **"Bumper Stumpers" (Canadian; 1987–1990):** Canadians guess license plate puns—cheesy, repetitive, truly numbing

**Sitcoms & Repetitive Imports:**
- **"Three's Company" (US):** Worn-out misunderstandings, endless sexual innuendo. Never-ending confusion disables logic centers
- **"The Littlest Hobo" (Canadian; 1979–1985):** Friendliest mutt saves the day in every town. The dog never leaves, the episode never really ends, the music loops eternally
- **"Happy Days" re-runs:** Time-locked nostalgia and Fonz catchphrases. Induces passive, rose-tinted time slip into irrelevance
- **"The Beachcombers" (Canadian; 1972–1990):** Local legend, but very gentle and slow-paced. Soothing to the point of apathy; nothing ever really changes

**Infomercials/Local Programming:**
- **"UFO Cover Up Live" (US, 1980s) & Home Shopping:** Late-night infomercials and product demos. "Just TWO easy payments!" Loops forever, dulling ambition

### Effects on BC Population

- People begin greeting each other with "Come on down!" or "Just one more puzzle!"
- Kids whistle The Littlest Hobo theme compulsively
- Entire communities lose track of time, waiting for "the next contestant"
- Dreams are haunted by cryptic license plates and Bob Barker's ghostly smile
- TV always "on" in every home, even empty ones
- Empty parks after 5 p.m.—only one or two odd kids outside
- Everyone refers to time as "after The Price Is Right" or "before Wheel"

### Generational Response to TV Mind Control

**The Elders (born pre-World War II):**
- Skeptics & Holdouts: Prefer radio, puzzles, or reading; some are nostalgic for pre-TV days
- Less Affected, More Observant: Likeliest to notice "young people don't seem right lately"
- Hook: Player might hear a grandparent mutter, "That dog's been running for years and no one's caught on…"

**Boomers (born late 1940s–early 1960s, now parents):**
- The Complacent: The most sedated. TV is their babysitter, evening ritual, and mental vacation
- Vaguely Dissatisfied: Some remember "building things," "going outside," but can't muster willpower to do more than complain
- Hook: Easily distracted from chores/parenting by TV, ready with game show banter

**Gen X Teens (born late 1960s–early 70s):**
- Restless, Suspecting: Some actively resent the TV-ruled home. Start seeking out pirate radio, zines, skateboarding, or underground scenes
- Alternate Media: Likeliest to notice the weird static, or spot the "never-ending" sameness
- Rebel Potential: They're the natural heroes/stirrers-of-trouble for investigations
- Hook: A punk who writes graffiti: "Your TV is lying to you."

**Kids (10 and under):**
- Most Lucid When Unsupervised: When actively playing outside, kids seem sharper. After long TV sessions, they repeat show lines or act out commercials robotically
- Creepy Singing: Young siblings chant the "Littlest Hobo" theme, or hum game show tunes, unconsciously
- Hook: Local teacher notes her students' drawings all include televisions with "blue eyes" or towers emitting rays

### Broadcast Takeover Plot (BC Style)

Aliens hack into the local cable feed and start a never-ending block of:
- Definition → The Littlest Hobo → Three's Company → The Beachcombers → The Price is Right → Infomercial Loop, then repeat

**Sample Invasion Dialogue:**
> "Citizens of British Columbia, it is now time for...DEFINITION. The answer is: 'What you feel after watching game shows for 72 hours.' Five letters."
> 
> "Come on down, you're the next contestant on...THE CANADIAN HIVE MIND."

### Investigation Hooks

- **TV Static Analysis:** Characters discover periodic, inexplicable static on all channels—especially during certain shows. Tech-savvy characters notice the static overlaps with subtle humming or coded signals
- **Scheduling Patterns:** Sharp characters recognize that scheduling blocks on different networks are eerily similar—game shows at the same time across channels, similar sitcom plots
- **Local Legend:** The librarian, an old-timer, recalls that after TV was introduced, "people just… stopped doing things in the evening." Newspaper archives show subtle uptick in "lost time" or decreased club/society activity since the late 1940s
- **Wrong Signal:** A local ham radio operator picks up echoes of shows before they officially air—slightly mutated, as if from a shadow broadcast
- **Physical Device:** A hidden maintenance room in the CBC tower contains a non-human device humming in sync with TV transmissions—radiating the same modulation as the "static"
- **Confrontation:** A programmer or technician behaves robotically, as if "activated" by certain TV theme songs or infomercial jingles

## Themes & Tone

- **Unseen Ritual:** The truly powerful occult workings are hidden within the ordinary, and all are complicit—from ad execs to preachers to clueless designers.
- **Gaslit Reality:** Doubting the pattern becomes the first step toward madness... or awakening.
- **Culture as Cage:** No safe space remains; every joke, jingle, and visual carries the risk of subtle psychic infection.
- **The Slow Sedative:** Decades of carefully-engineered television content have created a population primed for passivity, with the 1980s representing the apex of zombification.
