# Astral Dimension

**Type:** Dimensional plane / Supernatural realm  
**Origin:** The realm of the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) (Outsiders)  
**Era:** Present since the creation of dimensions

## Overview

The **Astral Dimension** is the realm of the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) (Outsiders), a barren place of other-dimensional nothingness extending in all directions. It is a bright, gray void where what little solid substance exists typically consists of chunks of matter broken off from their original dimension.

The Astral Dimension can be reached from almost any point in a Prime Material plane or first layer of any Outer plane by psionic ability or device.

## Physical Properties

- **Gravity:** The Astral Dimension has no gravity, but objects do retain their mass, so you can throw small items or push off from large objects to move in the weightless environment.
- **Time:** Time in the Astral flows at the same rate on a Prime Material plane, but the effects of time are slowed almost to a stop—a thousand years in the Astral plane feels like only a day to the traveler. Hence, it is sometimes considered effectively timeless. Creatures do not go hungry or age while in the Astral plane. For that reason, its mortal inhabitants needed to return to the Material Plane in order to have children or to reach adulthood.

## Entering the Astral Dimension

Entering the Astral plane can be accomplished in one of two ways:

1. **Astral Projection:** Projecting your astral form into the plane via psionic ability. This is the safest way to travel but still involves risk because you leave your physical body behind on the traveler's plane of origin. The astral body would be accompanied by the astral forms of any items and clothing that were magical or radiated a magic aura. The physical body left behind appears alive but does not require food, water, or air and does not age. It could be moved and is vulnerable to damage and death. If the traveler's physical body is slain, death follows the projection some minutes later. If the astral self is slain, the traveler then returns to his or her physical body in a coma.

2. **Physical Entry:** Physically entering the Astral plane requires a spell, psionic ability, or device such as plane shift.

## Geographical Features

Upon entering the Astral plane, travelers see a silvery color pool nearby—a portal to the location on the Prime Material plane from which they originated. Astral projecting travelers see their silver cord leading back to this pool. Color pools appear as two-dimensional circles about 10–60 ft (3–18 m) in diameter and only visible from one side unless they have some way to detect invisible objects. Pools of different colors are portals to the different Outer planes. Each Outer plane has its own unique color, but the traveler's home portal is always a metallic silver, rippling like mercury in a pan.

Color pools could be used to view the destination plane before stepping through by mentally concentrating on the nearby pool until it became transparent. A viewer could also move (with some limitations) the portal's viewpoint by concentration. Astral projecting travelers formed a new physical body (with silver cord attached) when they stepped through a color pool to their destination plane. The new body was formed out of local materials so the greater the similarity between one's home plane and the destination, the more one's new body looked like the original one.

The Astral Dimension is considered to be boundless.

## The Akashic Record

The **Akashic Record** is a physical place in the astral realm—its own infinite library containing all knowledge, all events, and all possibilities. It is said that those who can access the Akashic Record can learn anything that has ever been known or will be known.

## Relationship with Elohim

The Astral Dimension is the native realm of the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) (Outsiders). They are born here when dark matter adheres to the brightest sparks of light and energy that result from the creation of a dimension. The Elohim use the Astral Dimension as a base from which to manipulate the Prime Material plane, conducting long-term experiments and influencing human history.

## In Play

The Astral Dimension serves as:

- **Elohim home base** - Where the Outsiders originate and operate from
- **Psionic travel destination** - Advanced psionicists can project into the Astral
- **Knowledge repository** - The Akashic Record contains all knowledge
- **Dimensional crossroads** - Color pools lead to other planes and dimensions
- **Time dilation effects** - Useful for long-term planning or research

### Game Considerations

- The Astral Dimension is extremely dangerous for mortals
- Elohim are at their most powerful in their native realm
- Astral projection leaves the physical body vulnerable
- Time dilation can create temporal paradoxes
- The Akashic Record is a powerful but dangerous source of knowledge
