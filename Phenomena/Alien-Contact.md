# Alien Contact

**Type:** Phenomenon / Encounter type  
**Era:** Ongoing since the 1940s

## Overview

**Alien Contact** refers to any direct encounter or communication between a human and an extraterrestrial being, short of abduction. These experiences may involve sightings, telepathic messages, encounters, or shared visions. People who report such experiences are known as **contactees**.

For forced or involuntary encounters, see [Alien Abductions](./Phenomena/Alien-Abductions.md).

## Types of Contact

### Sightings

Visual encounters with [UFOs](./Vehicles/UFOs.md) or [alien entities](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md). These range from distant lights in the sky to close encounters where the witness can clearly see the craft or beings.

### Telepathic Communication

Some contactees report receiving telepathic messages from alien entities. These messages may be:
- Warnings about environmental destruction
- Instructions or prophecies
- Requests for assistance
- Philosophical or spiritual teachings
- Threats or demands

### Shared Visions

Contactees sometimes experience shared visions or dreams that appear to be transmitted by alien entities. These visions may show:
- Future events
- Alien worlds or civilizations
- Warnings about coming disasters
- Instructions for preparing for contact

### Physical Encounters

Direct physical encounters with alien entities, though these are rare and often escalate to abduction scenarios. Physical contact may involve:
- Touch or physical interaction
- Exchange of objects or materials
- Medical examinations (short of full abduction)
- Communication through gestures or symbols

## Contactees

People who report alien contact experiences are known as **contactees**. They may:

- Form groups or organizations to share experiences
- Become advocates for alien contact
- Develop psychological issues from the experience
- Be targeted by government agencies for debriefing
- Be dismissed as delusional or attention-seeking
- Become involved with [UFO religions](./Factions/Cults/UFO-Religion.md) or cults

## The Truth

Most "contact" experiences are actually:

- **Grey Operations:** The [Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md) (biological constructs created by the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md)) conducting reconnaissance or psychological operations
- **Elohim Manipulation:** The Elohim themselves using telepathic communication to influence or test humans
- **Government Disinformation:** False flag operations designed to discredit genuine witnesses or test public reactions
- **Psychological Phenomena:** Stress, trauma, or mental illness manifesting as contact experiences
- **Thin Veil Effects:** Experiences caused by proximity to [thin veil areas](./Phenomena/Thin-Veil-Areas.md) where reality is unstable

## In Play

Alien contact serves as:

- **Investigation hooks** - M-EPIC agents may be called to investigate contact reports
- **Character backgrounds** - PCs may have had contact experiences that led them to M-EPIC
- **Plot devices** - Contactees may provide information or become targets
- **Red herrings** - Some contact reports may be false or misinterpreted
- **Faction connections** - Contactees may be recruited by various groups

### Game Considerations

- Contact experiences should feel mysterious and potentially dangerous
- The line between genuine contact and delusion should be unclear
- Government agencies may be monitoring contactees
- Contactees may be targeted by hostile factions
- Some contact experiences may be part of larger conspiracies
