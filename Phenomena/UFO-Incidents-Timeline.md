## Overview

This timeline documents major UFO encounters, operations, and unexplained phenomena in British Columbia from 1946 to 1985. These incidents fill police files, local legend, oral stories, and background research, establishing a pattern of high-strangeness that has been systematically covered up or explained away by authorities.

## 1946-1973: Early Encounters

### 1946: The Silver Formation

- Dozens of fishermen on the Fraser River witness six disk-shaped lights moving silently in V-formation at dawn. RCMP chalk it up to "experimental aircraft" but fishermen report compasses spinning in circles.

### 1947: Chilcotin Flyer

- Ranchers near Williams Lake observe a "flying wing" swooping low and causing all the cattle in a field to collapse, apparently paralyzed. Local doctor called in; the case sealed and declared a hoax by military police.

### 1948: Terrace Fireballs

- Multiple glowing orbs seen darting between peaks during a record forest fire northwest of Terrace. Fire lines advance in odd swirling patterns that firefighters can't explain.

### 1949: Mount Currie Midnight Walkers

- A series of shrieking "ape men" are reported raiding salmon traps. Elders say not to travel after dark—days later, a "silver canoe with no paddle" is seen drifting over the treetops.

### 1950: The Nanaimo Landing

- A baker jogging before sunrise stumbles into a mist-filled hollow and claims to see a metallic egg on tripod legs. He's found hours later with burns on hands and feet; RCMP confiscate his shoes and flour-dusted watch.

### 1951: West End Window

- At midnight, two teenage girls in Vancouver swear a "man with mirror eyes" stares at them through their apartment window—five stories up. Shadows seen dancing across the ceiling. No forced entry found.

### 1952: Mass Whistler Blackout

- The entire ski town loses power after blinding blue-green lightning zigzags down the mountain. Next morning, "impossible" multicolored snow spirals litter the slopes.

### 1953: Tofino Submergence

- Fishermen watch a bright disc descend into the ocean; hours later, local fish and marine mammals float dead to the surface. Navy spends days "testing for radiation."

### 1954: Revelstoke Standoff

- Rail workers spot a "metal egg" landed by the tracks with small figures in tight grey suits poking at ballast stones. When approached, all machines and lanterns fail, and the beings vanish in a pulse of blinding light.

### 1955: Canal Flats Headlights

- RCMP officer responding to a traffic call encounters two identical "cars" head-to-head—lights ablaze, engines silent. The vehicles vanish after a burst of static from the police radio; shovel-head prints found in the roadside dirt.

### 1956: Lytton Thunderbird

- First Nations elders report a "canoe of mist" descending into a ravine, accompanied by thunder with no storm. Afterward, traditional pictographs appear freshly painted.

### 1956: Ashcroft Mirror Gate

- A trapper finds a "wall of running quicksilver" between two aspens. A Grey steps through, inspects his rucksack, then gestures for him to "go." The wall closes; the next day, a giant barefoot track is found at the spot.

### 1957: Penticton Schoolyard Incident

- Dozens of schoolchildren witness a "metal man" walking across the edge of a sports field. Teachers discourage talk; one child vanishes from her home a week later, never found.

### 1960: The Rainier Cigar

- Pilots flying between Seattle and Vancouver see a long, cigar-shaped object, trailing "silver dust," which clogs engines of a mail plane. Mail contracts warn pilots to avoid "certain flight corridors" for a month.

### 1961: Dog Creek Drifters

- Old roadmen report "lights like daylight" and "children in silver" drifting over the cattle range. Next day, they find tufts of odd dark fur on barbed wire and circular marks burned in the grass.

### 1962: Elk Valley Sasquatch Rescue

- School group lost in the woods during a storm. Later found—unharmed—in a pine shelter, all babbling about a "giant hairy man who roared at silver bug men" and tucked the children in before vanishing.

### 1963: Quesnel Barn Awakening

- After an unseasonal snowstorm, a farmer finds livestock unconscious and barn doors warped into impossible curves, like melted wax. Family thereafter plagued by strange dreams of "faces peering through barn cracks."

### 1964: Kitimat Black Helicopter

- Hikers report a duel between a "silent black chopper" and three floating white ovals. After beams of green and blue flicker, one oval crashes to the forest floor and is gone when investigators arrive.
- Burnt trees form a perfect circle; a wild man's footprints seen at the edge.

- Crops in perfect circles found burned and blackened—no tracks in or out. Dog-walkers later see "triangular shadows" flickering at dusk, vanishing when approached.

### 1970: Dease Lake Blackout

- A remote town blacks out as a "shadow" passes over at noon. When power returns, all clocks are reset to midnight and some people are found outside, in pajamas, unable to recall sleepwalking.

### 1971: Port Hardy Lost Time

- Travelers on a coastal road encounter a floating sphere that bathes them in white light. They awaken miles away, with pockets full of polished stones and memories of "long-armed doctors with black eyes and giant, sad animals watching from trees."

## 1974-1984: The Modern Wave

### 1974: "Nanaimo Flashlights"

- **Dozens report bright, darting lights and odd power fluctuations across Vancouver Island.** Publicly written off as "military flares." Internally, the RCMP opens "File 467-BL" after black glass shards are recovered from a scorched logging road.

### 1974: Powell River Forest Watch

- A series of break-ins at a logging camp—a search reveals the thief: an immense Sasquatch. Native workers claim it was "guarding us" after a "moon-silver canoe" landed upriver days before.

### 1975: Operation Sky Patch

- **NORAD scrambles interceptors after a "metallic cloud" is tracked moving at impossible speed from the Queen Charlottes to Kamloops.** Aircraft experience unexplained instrument malfunction; incident covered up, but a small team of research physicists is given new, "special" clearance.

### 1975: Invermere Blue Mist

- Fishermen on a lake drift into iridescent blue fog, see a hovering disc with pairs of Greys lowering rods into the water. Several large, dark animals (Sasquatch?) seen wading nearby, howling. The Greys flee, the disc spins away, leaving the fog acrid and stinging.

### 1976: Okanagan Abduction Wave

- **Cluster of missing persons and near-identical abduction stories among orchard workers and indigenous teens near Okanagan Lake.** First Nations "Circle of Watchers" perform lakefront rituals; RCMP quietly coordinate with local elders, and a burned-out vehicle is discovered with "impossibly smooth" melted metal at the site.

### 1976: Bella Bella Starfall

- Dozens see green streaks from the sky drop into thick forest; fishermen later find a circle of pressed ferns, three charred Greys, and a scattering of stone "totems" placed upright in fresh earth.

### 1976: Prince Rupert Disappearance

- A tug captain and his crew vanish after radioing in a "huge light fishing for us." The ship found adrift, engines cold, coffee still warm.

### 1976: Garibaldi Glimmer

- A winter mountaineer's club near Garibaldi Lake reports massive, pulsing blue lights beneath an ice shelf. After a member vanishes and is found 48 hours later—shoeless, dehydrated, speaking only in dead languages—the area is quietly cordoned off by the military, citing "avalanche risk." **ORION logs increased geomagnetic activity for weeks.**

### 1977: Project Night Timber

- **Strange triangular lights observed above logging clearcuts in the Kootenays and Skeena.** Timber crews quit en masse after a whole camp wakes up 90 minutes late with watches all stopped at the same instant. **ORION personnel collect "biomass anomaly samples" from nearby moss.**

### 1977: The Cedar Skyfall (CRASHED UFO)

- Loggers in the Skeena drainage witness a fiery object tearing through the clouds, smashing into a remote cedar grove. The next morning, RCMP, military, and black-suited "government men" are airlifted in. **All locals are paid to leave for months; truckloads of metallic wreckage vanish at night.** Later, mushrooms and yellow moss sprout in perfect circles at the site—wildlife avoids the entire valley.

### 1977: Skeena Midnight Tramplers

- During a wave of Grey abductions (witnesses describe floating "tiny men with the stare of dead fish"), locals organize a watch. Their camp is found obliterated, with immense fur and flesh stuck to broken saplings; the Greys apparently driven off by something massive.

### 1978: "March of the Mendicants"

- **Reports of silent, black-clad strangers questioning rural residents after several livestock mutilations in the Fraser Valley.** UBC folklore team starts logging "men in black" folklore as a research dataset—several faculty then subjected to coordinated break-ins in the subsequent weeks.

### 1978: Fraser Canyon Flare

- Truckers forced to stop by a blinding orange flare see a torpedo-shaped craft skitter across the cliffs, with humanoid Greys scrambling after fallen equipment. RCMP retrieve a silvery coil, soon requisitioned by Orion International.

### 1978: Osoyoos Lake Intruders

- Night fishermen report being circled by glowing orbs over Osoyoos Lake, accompanied by paralyzing fear and the appearance of a glassy "black canoe" beneath the water's surface. **A patch of the lake is later found to fluoresce under moonlight; fish from this area have double pupils and are never caught twice.**

### 1979: Operation Ice Watch

- **Winter: NORAD and Canadian Forces document unregistered radar signatures moving beneath mountain glaciers south of Tatshenshini.** Search helicopters deployed, returning photos of perfectly circular "thaw rings" found in ice. **All film is confiscated by "federal security."**

### 1979: Port Renfrew Radio Bloom

- The CBC relay in Port Renfrew's signal begins broadcasting overlapping voices in Haida, Dutch, and "unknown static." Local children have identical nightmares about "windows in the ocean sky." Engineers restore the signal, but several refuse to ever return, citing "whispers behind the equipment."

### 1979: Squamish River Standstill

- All traffic on the highway halts as a "glowing man with long arms and no eyes" stands in the middle of the road. Behind him, a "bear-sized shadow" lumbers in and out of the brush, unseen by most but recorded on one witness's Polaroid as a gigantic blur.

### 1980: "Nelson Highway Nightmare"

- **A logging truck vanishes for 7 hours on a rural road outside Nelson.** Driver is found dazed, raving about "gray dolls in metal pajamas." Tires are still warm, but the radio plays two days' worth of local station content compressed into ten minutes.

### 1980: The Vanishing Barge

- A logging barge heading down the Fraser River with a full cargo disappears between Hope and Mission. Days later it's found beached on a sandbar, cargo intact, crew missing, decks covered in wet, hand-sized feathers. **Ornithologists identify the feathers as no known species.** RCMP records use the code "Gosling."

### 1981: Operation Stargazer

- **Orion International launches "area denial" protocols** after their automated survey drone films a massive, disc-shaped shadow gliding beneath the canopy near Peace River. **Control center logs spikes in background static and receives faint, rhythmic beeping that cannot be attributed to known radio sources.**

### 1981: Bella Coola Sasquatch Rescue

- A wildlife photographer is found deep in the Bella Coola Valley, cradled in a nest of cedar and fern. She claims to have been pursued by Greys ("white-eyed children") before a "giant covered in leaves" intervened, tossing the Greys into a river and leaving her a handful of blue stones. **Her recovered photos are all overexposed, but one shows a massive five-fingered print beside a smashed drone.**

### 1981: Gold River Farmhouse Fugitives

- A farmer and his family disappear for three days; their farmhouse is found open, wood stove burning, food half-eaten. **When found, the family claims to have "visited the house of glass under the mountain," where "men with empty skin" examined them.** All develop intense aversions to metal cutlery and refuse to speak about the incident again.

### 1982: "Chilliwack Communion"

- **A respected Dutch church deacon claims "the angels have visited" during a blackout—multiple witnesses recall time lost, voices in Dutch and in "bells and static."** **ORION's response team and a squad of Dutch Men in Black appear within 24 hours, confiscate church records, and quietly "counsel" all witnesses.**

### 1982: Cranbrook Ball Lightning

- A hobbyist astronomer records a series of red-orange "ball lightning" events racing across the valley floor, followed by sightings of "metallic rods" standing upright along a railway embankment at dawn. **Local power stations overload that night, with no thunder reported for fifty miles.**

### 1983: Project Blue Lantern

- **UBC geology department reports a perfectly round field of fused stone and glass found during a landslide survey near Lillooet.** Subsequent night photography reveals orbs of light "wired together with blue strands" over the site—several grad students hospitalized with acute paranoia and corneal burns.

### 1983: Kamloops Tunnel Blockade

- Construction crews on a new highway tunnel are pushed out by intense nausea, blue flickering lights, and "singing" that causes workers to black out. **Later investigation finds marble-sized glass beads and faint circular glyphs along the rock face, which can only be seen on infrared film.** The tunnel is re-routed, never completed.

### 1984: "Orion Uplink Incident"

- **For several minutes, the Orion satellite network continuously receives synchronized "ping" responses**—like sonar echoes—_from above and below_ the triangulated Okanagan Valley. **The AI catalogs 437 anomalies and briefly flags "systemic intrusion."** Emergency comms are cut for one hour; a massive magnetic storm follows days later, blamed officially on "solar flare activity."

### 1984: Sooke Fog Walkers

- Multiple hikers go missing in wall-to-wall fog near Sooke. Rescued survivors recount being led to safety by a procession of "tall, thin people in raincoats" with no faces or hands, who dissolve one by one as the sun rises. **None of the hikers can remember how they escaped, and all have numbers written on their palms in blue ink.** Townsfolk quietly refer to the stretch as _"the Lost Mile"_ and warn tourists to avoid the fog.

## How They're Covered Up/Remembered

- **1974-76:** RCMP and Social Credit officials spin it as weather/industrial incidents. Conspiracy fanzine "The True North Scream" begins circulation.
- **1977-79:** Logging unions and First Nations press for more answers. Several witnesses are transferred, lose jobs, or leave town.
- **1980-82:** Wave of "alien" and "angel visitation" stories in Dutch, Mennonite, and indigenous communities, but official records never mention the incidents.
- **1983-84:** Scientists and researchers "silenced" or co-opted by new job offers, grants, or are shuffled off to "fieldwork" abroad. **ORION's AI grows increasingly autonomous, suspected of quietly flagging or erasing high-strangeness reports.**

## In Play

This timeline serves as:

- **Background information** - Establishing the pattern of encounters and cover-ups
- **Investigation hooks** - PCs can investigate specific incidents or patterns
- **Campaign history** - Understanding what has happened before 1985
- **Evidence sources** - Old case files, witnesses, and physical evidence
- **Pattern recognition** - Identifying connections between incidents

### Game Considerations

- The timeline shows escalating activity and sophistication of cover-ups
- Many incidents involve interactions between Greys and Sasquatch
- ORION's role becomes more prominent in later incidents
- The timeline demonstrates the systematic nature of the cover-up
- Specific incidents can be used as adventure hooks or background
