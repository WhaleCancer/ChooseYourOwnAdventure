# Missing Time

**Type:** UFO phenomenon / Psychological effect  
**Era:** Documented in abduction cases since 1947

## Overview

**Missing time** is a phenomenon where individuals cannot account for periods of time, often hours or even days. This is one of the most common indicators of potential alien abduction and is frequently reported by abductees.

## Characteristics

### Typical Missing Time Experience

- **Unexplained Gaps** - Cannot remember what happened during a specific period
- **Time Discrepancy** - Clock or calendar shows more time has passed than remembered
- **Fragmented Memories** - Vague, dream-like memories that may surface later
- **Disorientation** - Confusion about location or circumstances upon "return"
- **Physical Symptoms** - Fatigue, headaches, or other symptoms after missing time

### Common Scenarios

- **Driving** - Missing time while driving, often on remote roads
- **Camping** - Missing time while camping or in wilderness areas
- **Home** - Missing time while at home, often during sleep
- **Work** - Missing time during work or routine activities

## Investigation

### Indicators of Missing Time

- **Time Discrepancies** - Clocks showing different times than expected
- **Location Changes** - Finding oneself in a different location without memory of travel
- **Physical Evidence** - Unexplained marks, bruises, or other physical signs
- **Witness Accounts** - Others reporting the person was missing or acting strangely
- **Psychological Symptoms** - Anxiety, depression, or other trauma symptoms

### M-EPIC Procedures

M-EPIC agents investigate missing time cases by:

- **Timeline Reconstruction** - Establishing what happened during the missing period
- **Hypnotic Regression** - Using hypnosis to recover suppressed memories (controversial)
- **Physical Examination** - Checking for implants, scars, or other evidence
- **Witness Interviews** - Speaking with anyone who may have seen the individual
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying connections to other abduction cases

## Theories

### Psychological Explanations

- **Dissociative Amnesia** - Psychological defense mechanism
- **Sleep Disorders** - Sleepwalking or other sleep-related issues
- **Stress** - Extreme stress causing memory loss
- **Trauma** - Repressed traumatic memories

### Paranormal Explanations

1. **Alien Abduction** - Time spent aboard alien craft
2. **Time Manipulation** - Aliens manipulating time perception
3. **Memory Suppression** - Deliberate suppression of memories by aliens
4. **Dimensional Shifts** - Time spent in alternate dimensions or realities

### The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> Missing time is often the result of alien abduction, where individuals are taken aboard craft (typically by Greys/Elohim constructs) and their memories are suppressed or altered. The time discrepancy may be real (time spent aboard craft) or perceived (memory manipulation).

## In Play

Missing time serves as:

- **Investigation hook** - Cases that lead to abduction scenarios
- **Mystery element** - Unexplained gaps creating investigation opportunities
- **Character development** - Characters experiencing missing time
- **Evidence** - Indicator of potential abduction or contact
- **Psychological horror** - Trauma and memory issues affecting characters

### Game Considerations

- Missing time creates personal mystery and investigation opportunities
- The phenomenon can affect player characters, creating personal stakes
- Memory recovery (through hypnosis or other means) provides investigation tools
- The connection to abductions ties into broader alien activity
- Psychological effects create roleplaying challenges
