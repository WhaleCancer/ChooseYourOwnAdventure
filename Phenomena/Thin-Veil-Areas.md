# Thin Veil Areas

**Type:** Supernatural phenomenon / Dimensional anomaly  
**Location:** Throughout British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest  
**Era:** Present since ancient times, with increasing activity in 1985

## Overview

**Thin Veil Areas** are the Pacific Northwest's supernatural fault lines—dangerous, mysterious, sacred, and critical to every faction's agenda. Knowing them means knowing the true map of power, risk, and mystery.

Thin veil areas are places where the fabric separating our world from another reality—the domain of the [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Elohim]] (Outsiders)—is worn, damaged, or naturally weak. Throughout the Pacific Northwest, these spots appear in folklore as haunted groves, sacred valleys, "bad luck" stretches of road, or legendary lake shores. In scientific circles, they're known as "anomalous zones" or "dimensional shear sites." The Halkomelem call them **Sqa'tsəxw** (s-KAT-seh, "Thin Place").

## Common Traits

- **Unexplained Phenomena:** Electronics fail, compasses spin, strange mists form, animal behavior warps, and people experience time slips, déjà vu, or vivid dreams.
- **Repeated Incidents:** Higher rates of missing persons, unusual animal deaths, ghost lights, and "UFO" sightings cluster in these places.
- **Old Warnings:** Indigenous elders, local loggers, and fishermen alike treat these sites with caution or outright avoidance, often possessing traditional rituals or fetishes to "bind" or appease whatever lurks nearby.
- A subtle sense of wrongness ("prickling skin," "buzzing in the teeth," "sense of being slightly out of phase").
- Animals freak out, refuse to cross, or vanish.
- People lose or conflate time, dream intensely, or become "possessed" by fleeting moods.
- Physical changes: phantom sounds, weird lights, sudden cold snaps, impossible geometry, or even temporary physical mutability (mirrored reflections move on their own, faint double-vision).

## GM-Facing Explanation

Thin veil areas are intersections of the mundane and the supernatural, where the boundary between the physical world and the Astral Dimension (the realm of the Elohim) is at its weakest due to natural formations, trauma (accidents, massacres, rapid industrialization), rituals, or even tectonic alignment.

## Why They Matter

- **Access Points:** The Elohim and their [[Creatures/Aliens/Greys|Greys]] are most active here. These sites allow for easier crossing, increased psychic phenomena, and the manipulation of reality itself. Most abductions, sightings, and incursions occur in or near thin veil areas.
- **Destabilization Hotspots:** Corporate activity (logging, mining), ill-advised cult rituals, or government experiments can "thin" the veil further, making sites flare up or even shift position.
- **Signature Phenomena:** Each area develops a unique weirdness profile—certain electromagnetic readings, types of hallucination, peculiar geological features, or recurring dreams in the local population.
- **Adventure Seeds:** Encounters, mysteries, and clues look *mundane* until you account for the veil. Puzzle pieces—missing time, objects out of place, inexplicable weather—come into focus once agents understand the veil's importance.

## Possible Causes of Veil-Thinning

- Ancient meteor strikes, volcanic activity, magnetic anomalies, or certain mineral deposits.
- Sites of ritual, trauma, or mass emotion (battles, sacred ceremonies, disasters).
- Recent industrial activity (dynamiting, channel-dredging, over-logging) that "tears" or agitates the natural boundary.
- Dilute spiritual or psychic energy, focused by artificial means (satellite signals, experimental radar, ritual gatherings).

## Known Thin Veil Areas

### Okanagan Lake

The home of [[Creatures/Cryptids/Ogopogo-Statblock|Ogopogo]], Okanagan Lake is a major thin veil area. The deepest, coldest lake trenches are where the "veils" are thinnest, and sightings of both Ogopogo and UFOs cluster around the lake.

### Other Locations

- Sacred Indigenous sites throughout BC
- Remote mountain valleys
- Deep glacial lakes
- Areas of historical trauma or massacre
- Sites of industrial activity that has "torn" the veil

## In Play

Thin veil areas serve as:

- **Adventure locations** - Where the weird happens most frequently
- **Investigation sites** - Unexplained phenomena cluster here
- **Faction battlegrounds** - Multiple groups seek to control or exploit these sites
- **Danger zones** - Where reality is unstable and normal rules may not apply

### Game Considerations

- Thin veil areas should feel wrong and unsettling
- Electronics and technology are unreliable near these sites
- Time and space can become distorted
- The Elohim and Greys are more active in these areas
- Indigenous knowledge often contains warnings about these places
- Corporate or government exploitation of these sites can make them worse
