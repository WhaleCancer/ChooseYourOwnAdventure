# Conspiracy Structure

**Type:** Setting framework / Meta-narrative  
**Era:** Ongoing

## Overview

The universe as the Player Characters experience it is a **prison dimension**. The **Archons** (also called Elohim, Outsiders, or Shining Children) are the golden-robed jailors who maintain this prison. They are intelligences from a higher, adjacent dimension, and all of them believe in some form of keeping humans jailed. The [[Creatures/Aliens/Greys|Greys]] are sophisticated automata ("bio-automatons"): vat-grown pseudo-flesh, sophisticated robotics, devoid of actual intellect or desire. The Archons control them remotely across dimensional boundaries.

## The Archons and the "Greys"

### The Archons

The Archons are the golden-robed jailors who maintain the prison dimension. Intelligences from a higher, adjacent dimension, their true forms are impossible for humans to perceive unaltered. They are as much psychic presences as physical beings, and perceive time and consciousness differently than humans. 

All Archons believe in keeping humans jailed, though they are divided into factions:
- **The Cruel Faction:** Take active pleasure in human suffering and maintain the prison through fear and oppression
- **The Indifferent Faction:** Maintain the prison through bureaucratic efficiency and systematic control
- **The Almost Benevolent Faction:** Maintain the prison but believe in making it comfortable or "reforming" humans to be better prisoners

See [[Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim|Archons]] for detailed information.

### The Greys

Classic UFO Greys—short, big-headed, featureless, emotionless. In truth, they are sophisticated automata ("bio-automatons"): vat-grown pseudo-flesh, sophisticated robotics, devoid of actual intellect or desire. The Elohim control them remotely across dimensional boundaries.

## Conspiracy Theories in the 80s (Alex Jones Style)

- **Dimensional Portals:** Rumors abound of Cold War projects (American, Soviet, and even Canadian) using particle accelerators or radar arrays to open "doorways" – actual programs at decommissioned NORAD radar sites or abandoned missile silos (see [[Factions/Government/Project-Greycoast|Project GREYCOAST]]).
- **Government Complicity:** Popular pirate radio DJs reference "Project Monarch" or "Operation Odin"—government attempts to communicate with (or defend against) beings from alternate realities, using psychic children, LSD, and quantum computers.
- **Mind Control:** Reports of chemical contamination in logging towns and supposed mind-control methods (fluoridated water, weird radio signals) being used to make people more "pliable" to manipulation by unseen intelligences (see [[Phenomena/The-Poison-Pipeline|The Poison Pipeline]] and [[Phenomena/Frequency-Fences|Frequency Fences]]).
- **The Disappeared:** Conspiracy nuts track missing persons—close-in-age, similar backgrounds—who overlap with places of "Thin Veil" activity, suggesting a hidden pattern.
- **Cults and Contactees:** Local hippie communes, survivalist militias, and cults all claim they have been "chosen" by space beings, and sometimes have odd, inexplicable knowledge.

## Adventure Hooks

- **Crash/Incident:** A logging crew finds a crashed "UFO" (damaged Grey craft) in the woods. The agents are sent to "contain" the incident, only to discover it's an automaton.
- **Weird Town:** The agents are sent to a town where people's memories don't match up, time seems "off," radio static is oddly persistent, and strange figures (Greys) are glimpsed.
- **Human Allies:** A local conspiracy radio host or charismatic cult leader claims to have direct knowledge of "interdimensionals," waving around suspiciously real alien tech.
- **Double Agents:** Some officials (or maybe even one of the PCs' higher ups) are secret cultists or "contactees," working against humanity for reasons that only make sense if your loyalties lie in another dimension.

## Greys/Elohim: Encounters & Twist Ideas

- Greys, upon being "killed," collapse into inert biological mechanisms—agents can find micro-circuitry inside them, not brains.
- The Archons can contact Agents in dreams; those with weak willpower may become "receptive" and develop strange psychic powers or memory loss.
- Missing persons turn up in the woods, scarred and changed, "hollowed out" but with knowledge of places and events they could never have experienced.

## Suggested Tone & Themes

- **Uncertainty:** The real goals of the Archons are clear—they are jailors—but their methods and factional conflicts create uncertainty about what any particular Archon might do
- **Paranoia:** Who's really in control? Are the leading conspiracy theorists legitimate whistleblowers, or unwitting pawns?
- **Cold War Paranoia:** The political friction can ground cosmic weirdness.
- **Mundane vs. Unexplainable:** The agents wrestle with ordinary jurisdiction (budget cuts, paperwork, RCMP rivalry) even as they glimpse glimpses of cosmic horror.

## Conspiracy Flavor: Sample NPC Rumors

1. _"Saw a Grey at the old mill. Swear on my mother's grave, it bled blue."_
2. _"Numbers station's been sending coordinates. They match up with places where kids went missing in '63."_
3. _"You can control them if you wear a copper hat filled with pine needles. Keeps 'em outta your head."_
4. _"There's a bunker under Lake Grant. Government's been keeping the real aliens there since the '50s. No one comes out."_

## Ready-to-use Plot Seed

_The agents discover a rural town has been "seeded" with a small number of bio-automaton Greys, who observe, mimic a few inhabitants, and occasionally abduct someone. The only person aware—a Vietnam vet with a pirate radio station—claims the Greys are just drones, and rants about "machine-souled angels from the higher orders." He dies under mysterious circumstances after directly contacting the agents—even as the veil between realities seems to thin._
