# Crop Circles

**Type:** UFO phenomenon / Communication system  
**Era:** Documented since the 1960s, surge in late 1970s-1980s

## Overview

**Crop circles** are patterns created in fields of crops (typically wheat, corn, or other grains) where the plants are flattened in geometric or symbolic patterns. While many crop circles are human-made hoaxes, some display characteristics that suggest non-human origin and are associated with UFO activity.

## Characteristics

### Genuine Crop Circles

- **Complex Geometry** - Intricate geometric patterns, often with mathematical precision
- **No Damage** - Plants are bent, not broken, and continue to grow
- **Energy Signatures** - Elevated electromagnetic readings or other energy anomalies
- **Overnight Formation** - Appearing overnight without witnesses
- **Mathematical Precision** - Patterns following mathematical or geometric principles

### Hoax Crop Circles

- **Simple Patterns** - Basic circles or simple geometric shapes
- **Broken Plants** - Plants are broken or damaged
- **Tool Marks** - Evidence of boards, ropes, or other tools
- **Witnesses** - People may have seen the creation
- **Admission** - Creators may admit to making them

## History

### Early Reports

- **1963** - Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire with nearby circular areas where wheat had been flattened
- **1960s** - Reports of circular formations in swamp reeds and sugarcane fields in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada
- **1967** - Three circles found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how
- **1966** - Tully "saucer nest" case, where a farmer witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise from a swamp

### Modern Era

The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared and spread since the late 1970s, with many circles beginning appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire.

British pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley reported they started creating crop circles in British cornfields in 1978, inspired by the Tully "saucer nest" case.

## Communication System

> [!info] Theory
> Crop circles are a two-way communication system using the alien language. The patterns correspond to symbols found in [Grey](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md) written language, which itself shows similarities to ancient Mayan and Egyptian languages.

The patterns may serve as:

- **Messages** - Communication from aliens to humans
- **Markers** - Marking locations of significance
- **Navigation** - Aids for alien craft navigation
- **Ritual** - Part of alien rituals or ceremonies

## M-EPIC Investigation

M-EPIC agents investigate crop circles by:

- **Pattern Analysis** - Studying the geometric and symbolic patterns
- **Energy Readings** - Measuring electromagnetic and other energy signatures
- **Sample Collection** - Collecting plant and soil samples for analysis
- **Witness Interviews** - Speaking with anyone who may have seen the formation
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying connections to UFO activity or other phenomena

## In Play

Crop circles serve as:

- **Investigation hooks** - Cases involving mysterious crop formations
- **Communication** - Messages or signals from aliens
- **Evidence** - Physical proof of non-human activity
- **Location markers** - Marking sites of significance or activity
- **Mystery** - Unexplained patterns requiring investigation

### Game Considerations

- Crop circles provide visible, public evidence of paranormal activity
- The communication angle creates opportunities for decoding messages
- The connection to Grey language ties into broader alien activity
- The mix of genuine and hoax circles creates investigation challenges
- The geometric precision suggests advanced technology or intelligence
