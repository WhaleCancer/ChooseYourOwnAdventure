# Frequency Fences

**Type:** Phenomenon / Infrastructure-based control system  
**Location:** Throughout British Columbia and Canada  
**Era:** Active since the 1970s

## Overview

The multitude of tall transmission towers—national radio beacons, television masts, the newly rising "satellite link" dishes, and even the official Dominion Observatory time signal—are not merely broadcasting news and sitcoms. They hum with **prison harmonics**: engineered frequencies and sub-audible patterns, designed by the [Archons](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) and implemented by compromised tech elites, that keep humanity pacified. These signals dampen critical thought, blunt spiritual resistance, intensify paranoia and helplessness, and, most importantly, reinforce the **Veil** that blots out awareness of dimensional truth.

**The Frequency Fence serves a dual purpose:** It is both a control mechanism and an energy harvesting system. The Archons are emotional vampires who feed on the emotional and psychic energy of humans. The Frequency Fence actively drains this energy from exposed populations, channeling it back to the Archons to sustain them while simultaneously weakening humans into submission. This emotional vampirism directly supports the prison planet goals—weakened, emotionally drained humans are less capable of recognizing their situation or organizing resistance.

## Mechanisms and Effects

### 1. The Prison Grid

- Transmission towers are placed not at random, but at precise geometric intervals mapped to ancient ley-lines and modulated by algorithms "gifted" during early [Grey](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md) encounters.
- Together, they create a resonant web—a Prison Grid—that overlays the land, forming an invisible "fence" that both contains souls and prevents true cosmic or psychic perception.
- Most urban centers lie deep within the denser knots of the grid, while remote wilderness and certain First Nations sacred sites fall in natural "nulls" or interference zones.

### 2. Broadcast Effects on the Population

- Prolonged exposure within grid nodal zones erodes the ability to question, dream, or rebel. Residents experience anxiety, dullness, or déjà vu; spiritual practices lose potency; "weirdness" is quickly forgotten. This is the result of emotional energy being drained—humans feel empty, apathetic, and emotionally numb as their life force is harvested.
- Sensitive or spiritually aware individuals (psychics, children, the mentally ill) suffer most—nightmares, nosebleeds, electronic interference, or a sense of being "watched by static." These individuals have more energy to harvest, making them prime targets.
- "Prison harmonics" peak during major broadcasts: the National Time Signal, election night coverage, New Year's Eve, or coordinated "emergency tests." During these peak periods, the emotional harvesting intensifies, and humans may feel particularly drained or submissive afterward.

### 3. Enforcement and Disruption

- Most routine maintenance is performed by oblivious workers, but high-level "Grid Technicians" know a little more, and guard certain sites zealously.
- Attempts to damage or hijack a tower risk attracting both state retaliation and sudden, ghostly interference—malfunctioning Greys are sometimes seen "tuning" equipment at night, ensuring the harvesting continues uninterrupted.
- Occult and rebel groups have learned that careful sabotage, signal jamming, or counter-broadcasts can create "thin spots"—brief safe areas where the Veil weakens and truth (or danger) seeps in.

### 4. Folk Knowledge and Resistance

- "Signal truthers" map Canada's grid nodes and broadcast schedules, sharing samizdat map-books or zines with warnings: "Here, you forget where you're going." "Avoid the powerline cut at dusk." "Band shell park: Don't sleep beneath the antenna."
- Indigenous traditions recognize some broadcast nodes as "sickness places" where animals vanish and dreams turn bad. Ceremonies and warding stones are sometimes planted to resist the harmonics.

## Practical and Playable Hooks

1. **Grid Node Town:** The PCs arrive at a village dominated by a 500-foot relay tower. Locals are oddly vacant and routines never change; since the installation, children's drawings feature static and towers. PCs may feel their moods flatten and thoughts jumble the closer they get to the node.

2. **Sabotage Mission:** A resistance contact tasks the party with disabling or re-tuning a rural tower ahead of a major state broadcast, buying time for a cult ritual or exposing a "Thin Veil" site. The site is eerily empty at midnight, save for flickering Greys who seem to phase in and out among the humming equipment.

3. **Counter-Signal Broadcast:** An outcast scientist or pirate radio operator believes they've developed a "clearing frequency" that can weaken the Veil locally. The PCs must help boost the signal while agents and terrifying phenomena converge.

4. **Haunted Grid Map:** The group comes into possession of a "blacklist" map—rumored to have cost a truther's life—that predicts areas of low/high prison harmonics day by day. Some places, it warns, are just waiting for the grid to drop.

## Atmospheric Details and Rumors

- "My mother says you can hear another voice in the time signal, if you tape it and play it backward—like someone's apologizing from inside a locked room."
- "Dad won't let us look at the red transmission light at night. Says it burns the dreaming part of your brain."
- "The day the tower in Hazel Run lost power, the whole town reported seeing lights in the woods and forgetting their names for minutes at a time."

## Themes

- **Techno-Occult Paranoia:** Infrastructure is weaponized, the air itself is a cell.
- **Geography as Fate:** Where you live, work, or travel determines how thick the Veil is—ritual, memory, and freedom all wax and wane with the invisible grid.
- **Hope in Static:** With knowledge, bravery, or pure luck, a group can slip the net, disrupt the grid, and find the places where the world weakens and the truths of the Archon prison are revealed...
