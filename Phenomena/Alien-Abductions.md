# Alien Abductions

**Type:** UFO phenomenon  
**Era:** Documented since 1947, increased reports in 1985

## Overview

Alien abductions are one of the most commonly reported UFO-related phenomena. Victims report being taken against their will by alien entities (typically [Greys](./Creatures/Aliens/Greys.md)), subjected to medical examinations, and returned with fragmented or missing memories.

## Common Abduction Patterns

### The Abduction Experience

1. **Initial Encounter** - Bright lights, paralysis, or sudden appearance of alien entities
2. **Transport** - Being taken aboard a craft (often described as a "flying saucer")
3. **Examination** - Medical procedures, sample collection, or experimentation
4. **Return** - Being returned to the original location, often with missing time
5. **Memory Fragments** - Vague, dream-like memories that may surface later

### Missing Time

Many abductees report "missing time" - periods where they cannot account for their whereabouts, often hours or even days. This is one of the most common indicators of a potential abduction.

### Physical Evidence

- **Implants** - Small objects found under the skin (see [Alien Implants](./Phenomena/Alien-Implants.md))
- **Scars** - Unexplained surgical scars or marks
- **Bruises** - Unexplained bruises or marks on the body
- **Radiation** - Elevated radiation levels in some cases

### Psychological Effects

- **Trauma** - Post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression
- **Memory Issues** - Fragmented memories, false memories, or complete amnesia
- **Sleep Disorders** - Nightmares, insomnia, sleep paralysis
- **Paranoia** - Fear of being watched or taken again

## M-EPIC Investigation

M-EPIC agents investigate abduction cases for several reasons:

- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying connections between cases
- **Physical Evidence** - Collecting implants, samples, and other evidence
- **Witness Protection** - Protecting abductees from further contact or harassment
- **Threat Assessment** - Determining the nature and purpose of abductions
- **Cover-up Operations** - Preventing public panic and maintaining secrecy

## Theories

### Official M-EPIC Theories

1. **Biological Research** - Greys are conducting genetic experiments or biological studies
2. **Hybrid Program** - Creating human-alien hybrids for unknown purposes
3. **Monitoring** - Tracking human development and progress
4. **Preparation** - Gathering information for a future invasion or contact

### The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> The "Greys" conducting abductions are actually biological constructs controlled by the [Elohim](./Creatures/Supernatural/Elohim.md) (Ethereals). The abductions serve multiple purposes: studying humans, collecting genetic material, and maintaining the cover story that Greys are independent alien visitors.

## In Play

Alien abductions serve as:

- **Investigation hooks** - Missing persons cases that lead to abduction scenarios
- **Witness encounters** - Abductees who may provide information or evidence
- **Physical evidence** - Implants, scars, and other proof of contact
- **Psychological horror** - Trauma and memory issues affecting characters
- **Conspiracy elements** - Government cover-ups and suppression of information

### Game Considerations

- Abductions create personal stakes for characters who may be targeted
- Missing time creates mystery and investigation opportunities
- Physical evidence provides tangible proof of paranormal activity
- Psychological effects create roleplaying challenges
- The connection to Elohim adds layers of cosmic horror
