# Alien Implants

**Type:** UFO phenomenon / Physical evidence  
**Era:** Found in abductees since the 1960s

## Overview

**Alien implants** are small objects found under the skin or in the bodies of individuals who report alien abduction experiences. These implants are often discovered through medical examination or X-rays and are considered physical evidence of alien contact.

## Characteristics

### Typical Implant Properties

- **Small Size** - Usually very small, often requiring X-rays or surgery to locate
- **Unusual Materials** - Made of materials not typically found in medical implants
- **No Rejection** - Body does not reject the implant (unlike normal foreign objects)
- **Strange Composition** - May contain unusual elements or structures
- **Active Components** - Some implants appear to have active electronic or biological components

### Common Locations

- **Nose** - Inside the nasal cavity
- **Ear** - Behind the ear or in the ear canal
- **Hand** - In the hand or wrist
- **Foot** - In the foot or ankle
- **Neck** - In the neck or throat area
- **Other** - Various locations throughout the body

## Game Mechanics

Alien implants use cyberware rules and thus **reduce LUCK by 1** per implant.

### Implant Effects

- **More Implants = More Attacks** - Individuals with more implants are more likely to be targeted by Greys for further abductions
- **Removal Consequences** - If you remove the implant, aggressive cancer may develop
- **Tracking** - Implants may be used to track or monitor individuals
- **Control** - Some implants may have mind control or influence capabilities

## M-EPIC Investigation

M-EPIC agents investigate alien implants by:

- **Medical Examination** - X-rays, MRIs, and other scans to locate implants
- **Surgical Removal** - Removing implants for analysis (with risks)
- **Laboratory Analysis** - Studying implant composition and function
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying connections between implant cases
- **Protection** - Helping individuals deal with implant-related issues

## Theories

### Official Explanations

- **Medical Implants** - Previously inserted medical devices
- **Foreign Objects** - Accidental foreign objects that entered the body
- **Hoaxes** - Deliberate insertion to support abduction claims
- **Natural Formations** - Natural calcifications or other formations

### Paranormal Theories

1. **Tracking Devices** - Implants used to track or monitor abductees
2. **Communication** - Implants used for communication or control
3. **Biological Monitoring** - Implants that monitor biological functions
4. **Genetic Markers** - Implants that mark individuals for future contact

### The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> Alien implants are placed by Greys (Elohim constructs) during abductions. They serve multiple purposes: tracking individuals, monitoring biological functions, and potentially controlling or influencing behavior. The implants are designed to integrate with the body and avoid rejection.

## In Play

Alien implants serve as:

- **Physical evidence** - Tangible proof of alien contact
- **Character complication** - Implants affecting characters mechanically and narratively
- **Investigation hook** - Cases involving implant discovery or removal
- **Threat** - Implants making characters targets for further abductions
- **Mystery** - Unknown purpose and function of implants

### Game Considerations

- Implants provide concrete physical evidence of abduction
- The LUCK penalty creates mechanical consequences
- The connection to further abductions creates ongoing threats
- Removal risks (cancer) create difficult choices
- The tracking/monitoring angle adds paranoia elements
