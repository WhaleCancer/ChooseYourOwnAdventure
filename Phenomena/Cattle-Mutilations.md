# Cattle Mutilations

**Type:** UFO phenomenon / Paranormal activity  
**Era:** Documented since the 1960s, active in 1985

## Overview

Cattle mutilations are cases where livestock (primarily cattle, but also horses, sheep, and other animals) are found dead with specific body parts removed with surgical precision. These mutilations are often associated with UFO activity and show patterns that suggest non-human involvement.

## Characteristics

### Typical Mutilation Pattern

- **Surgical Precision** - Cuts are clean and precise, suggesting advanced tools
- **Bloodless** - Little to no blood at the scene, despite major incisions
- **Specific Organs Removed** - Eyes, tongue, genitals, anus, udders, and other specific parts
- **No Tracks** - No footprints or vehicle tracks near the mutilation site
- **No Predator Signs** - No signs of animal predation (claw marks, teeth marks, etc.)
- **Radiation** - Sometimes elevated radiation levels at the site

### Common Removals

- Eyes
- Tongue
- Genitals
- Anus
- Udders (in cows)
- Internal organs (heart, liver, etc.)
- Rectum
- Lips

## Theories

### Official Explanations

- **Predator Attacks** - Coyotes, birds, or other animals
- **Cult Activity** - Ritualistic killings by human cults
- **Natural Decomposition** - Scavengers and natural processes
- **Hoaxes** - Deliberate mutilations to create panic

### Paranormal Theories

1. **Alien Research** - Greys or other aliens collecting biological samples
2. **Genetic Experiments** - Testing or collecting genetic material
3. **Monitoring** - Tracking environmental or biological changes
4. **Food Source** - Collecting specific nutrients or chemicals

### The Truth

> [!Danger] The Truth
> Cattle mutilations are often conducted by Greys (Elohim constructs) as part of their biological research programs. The precision and specific organ removal suggests systematic collection of samples for analysis or experimentation.

## M-EPIC Investigation

M-EPIC agents investigate cattle mutilations because:

- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying connections to UFO activity
- **Evidence Collection** - Gathering samples and physical evidence
- **Witness Protection** - Protecting ranchers and farmers from harassment
- **Threat Assessment** - Determining the nature and purpose of mutilations
- **Cover-up Operations** - Preventing public panic and maintaining secrecy

## Local Cattle Mutilation (Hunting Party)

In some cases, mutilations occur in clusters, suggesting a "hunting party" pattern where multiple animals are mutilated in a single area over a short period. This creates a site where cattle mutilations are occurring, requiring investigation and potentially intervention.

## In Play

Cattle mutilations serve as:

- **Investigation hooks** - Cases that lead to UFO or alien activity
- **Evidence** - Physical proof of non-human involvement
- **Rural settings** - Remote locations for investigation scenarios
- **Witness encounters** - Ranchers and farmers who have witnessed activity
- **Pattern recognition** - Connections between multiple mutilation cases

### Game Considerations

- Cattle mutilations provide tangible, physical evidence of paranormal activity
- The surgical precision creates a sense of advanced technology
- The lack of tracks or evidence creates mystery
- Rural settings provide opportunities for isolated investigation scenarios
- The connection to Greys and Elohim adds conspiracy layers
