**Type:** Historical timeline / Technology development  
**Era:** 1974-1984  
**Location:** British Columbia and Canada

## Overview

_A Hidden History of Cascadian Progress and Control_

This timeline documents the accelerated technological development in British Columbia, driven by reverse-engineered alien technology and Elohim influence. While publicly presented as normal industrial progress, these technologies have deeper connections to the paranormal and alien presence.

## 1974: The Black Glass Breakthrough

- **Discovery of Black Glass Circuits:** In secret, government-backed laboratories, engineers unveil the world's first "black glass" semiconductors—ceramic-black chips reverse-engineered from mysterious "alien" technology. These are generations ahead of conventional silicon: ultra-fast, self-stabilizing, immune to electromagnetic pulses, and capable of functioning in extreme environments.
- **Deployment:** The first black glass chips are restricted to classified mainframes (the early [[Factions/Corporations/Orion-International|ORION]] systems), strategic weather defense grids, and prototype autonomous mining bots.

## 1975: The Satellite Surge

**Stacked-Spectrum Satellite Relays:** Canada, in partnership with major corporations, launches next-generation "stacked spectrum" satellites. These super-powered, multi-band relays quietly revolutionize remote sensing, military communications, and weather prediction.

**Impact:** BC's forestry and mining industries experience a leap in remote sensing accuracy, while military communications become nearly unbreakable. For civilians, public TV and radio "static zones" vanish overnight—especially in the North and remote regions.

**Hidden Side:** Within the classified ORION program, these satellites are repurposed for covert surveillance—triangulating "transient anomalies" detected deep in the wilderness. Unbeknownst to the public, this includes tracking both unexplained environmental phenomena and suspected Elohim (alien) interference.

## 1976: Smart Alloys Enter Industry

- **Adaptive, Anomalous Materials:** Ore samples unearthed by [[Factions/Corporations/Atlas-Minerals|Atlas Minerals]] in a sealed Thule shaft are found to be "living metal"—impossibly fatigue-resistant, heat-stable, and paramagnetic.
- **Rollout:**
  - Used for structural upgrades in hydro-dams, helicopter blades, and—publicly denied—new Arrow Mark II airframes.
  - **Superstitions:** Miners refuse to carry jewelry near the new shafts; drillers speak of "singing steel" that vibrates in the dark.

### 1976: Micro-Emitter Materials

- **Development of Adaptive Alloys** Inspired by alien metal samples, factories begin using "smart" metals for high-end aircraft parts, logging equipment, and telecom relays—stronger, less prone to fatigue. No home applications yet, but industrial workers and military notice their gear lasts forever.

## 1977: Mammoth Storage

- **Data Tape Boom** A quiet leap in tape storage lets government, large companies, and research labs crunch and retain unprecedented quantities of data—nobody realizes how much is being recorded and archived.

### 1977: Data Hoards & Memory Anomalies

- **The Mammoth Tape Boom:** With black glass controllers and endless tape, Atlas, [[Factions/Corporations/Sterling-Timber|Sterling Timber]], and Orion store unprecedented data—transcripts, video logs, sensor sweeps.
- **Oddity:**
  - "Ghost tapes" emerge: reels recorded over erased footage, with phantom voices, time loops, or geometric "signal infections."
  - Some Arrow pilots report blackouts in test flights after returning from sites where these tapes are cached.

## 1978: Weather & Terrain Imaging

- **Quantum-Pulse Radar** Forestry, mining, and hydro agencies deploy new "pulse radar" and weird new cameras with unmatched detail. Nothing "flashy"—but overnight, backcountry maps and weather forecasts get far more precise, and logging companies operate more safely.

### 1978: Quantum Pulse Imaging

- **Terrain Mapping by Pulse Radar:** Resource companies roll out "quantum-pulse" ground-penetrating radar, claiming to refine disaster mapping.
- **Unintended Results:**
  - Atlas discovers mineral veins that oscillate on new maps; surveyors see shadows in unmapped valleys.
  - [[Vehicles/Planes/Avro-Arrow|Avro Arrow]] flight plans are quietly re-routed to avoid certain "hot zones," supposedly for geomagnetic safety.

## 1979: Power Grid Stabilization

- **Resilient Infrastructure Developments** BC Hydro incorporates new "phase harmonics" tech into the power grid. Blackouts are now rare; logging towns, mines, and even rural schools get a level of reliable, stable power previously unthinkable. The source? Allegedly just "a new type of relay."

### 1979: Power Grid Hardening

- **Phase Harmonics in Rural BC:** BC Hydro's new "harmonic relays" stabilize power across resource towns and bunkers—even in deep cold or after "solar surges."
- **Cover Story:**
  - Sources claim the tech is a side outcome of Arrow's avionics anti-jamming modules.
  - **Whispered Warning:** Some old loggers insist certain grid outages are intentional "reset points" during veil breaches.

## 1980: Rapid Long-Distance Communication

- **Fiber-Lumen Lines and Secure Networks** Installation of "fiber-lumen" trunk lines alongside traditional phone networks enables instant relay of data between government, military, and select corporations (Orion, big banks, a few universities). The public sees almost no change, but emergency services and resource companies suddenly "always get through."

### 1980: Fiber-Lumen Silent Networks

- **Buried Data Highways:** Orion, defense agencies, and select multinationals receive "fiber-lumen" trunklines—secure, instant, impossible for ordinary wiretap or radio interception.
- **Effect:**
  - Emergency response becomes eerily fast; industrial accidents "disappear" from the news cycles.
  - **Rumor:** Some lines cross known First Nations thin spots, with linemen reporting "echoes" or voice bleed from unconnected lines.

## 1981: Silent Electric Vehicles

- **Advanced Battery Packs in Industry** Logging camps and research groups start quietly rolling out battery-powered vehicles for rough terrain work—heavier than gas, but nearly silent and able to operate in deep cold/wet that kills regular engines.

### 1981: The Quiet Conversion

- **Boxy "Electric Beasts":** Logging camps, mining crews, and (rumor) select Arrow ground teams begin using heavy all-electric vehicles and drones—silent, rugged, running on chill-resistant "super-packs" of mysterious origin.
- **Note:**
  - When idle, these machines sometimes emit a hum or low "singing," sparking rumors of field paranormal activity.
  - First urban myth of a possessed loader overturning itself after a lightning storm.

## 1982: Construction & Demolition Robotics

- **Remote-Control Devices on the Worksite** Large construction, resource, and some military operations start using adaptable robot arms and semi-remote vehicles for jobs too dangerous for humans. Most people only notice that certain jobs are "less risky" and occasionally see odd, boxy vehicles moving on logging roads.

### 1982: Hands Off—Robotics & the New Crew

- **Remote Operators on the Job:** Demolition, tunnel building, and "deep zone" drill-heads go remote-control—ostensibly for safety, but also convenient for "black-site" shaft operations where human witnesses become liabilities.
- **Arrow Airfield Addition:**
  - Repairs to Arrow Mark II are increasingly conducted by unknown "contractor units" working after hours; night crew report finding cryptic tool kits with odd symbols.

## 1983: Field Medical Breakthroughs

- **Portable Diagnostic "Wands"** Paramedics and bush clinics adopt handheld diagnostic tools—officially adapted from "advanced German ultrasound." They give instant readouts of broken bones, organ distress, or even "unusual tissue response." Survival rates for wilderness accidents quietly rise.

### 1983: Medical Devices for the Unexplainable

- **Handheld Diagnostic 'Wands':** Paramedics in the bush receive ultrasound tools that "see" tissue, bone, and—rarely—non-organic "foreign bodies" no one can identify.
- **Side Effects:**
  - Some users report interference when scanning recently abducted (or anomalously affected) workers, with device screens briefly flashing untranslatable glyphs.
  - Supposedly, Arrow pilots undergo wand scans after odd encounters.

## 1984: The All-Seeing Network

- **Orion Command Integration** All of BC's emergency and industrial data, plus remote satellite imagery, is quietly piped to the new central processing hub at Orion International. The system analyzes everything—pattern-spotting hazards, routing emergency crews, anticipating weather and even logging protests. Officially, it's the "Resource Oversight Initiative." Some insiders wonder if there's more to its algorithms than meets the eye.

### 1984: Network of Omniscience

- **ORION Command Hub Activation:** Every channel—military, resource, government, academic—quietly flows into the new ORION supermainframe.
- **Publicly:** BC hails the "Resource Oversight Initiative"—accident reduction, faster rescue, zero lost survey flights, and "scientific progress in the North."
- **Secretly:**
  - Arrow flight telemetry and supernatural incident logs auto-feed to ORION, which now auto-generates restricted "action pings" and even pulls anomalous data from logging and mining sensors.
  - Some insiders whisper that ORION's real aim is not coordination, but interdimensional pattern mapping and containment—rumors intensify when a special Arrow is seen launching at dusk after a triple anomaly ping.

## Epilogue: Arrow in the Night

By 1984, the Avro Arrow isn't just a symbol of revived Canadian pride: it is a secret lynchpin of the new anomalous defense order—a machine touched by black glass and Elohim resonance, flying on wings of impossible metal over lands now mapped not just by hand or satellite, but by the eyes of the AI and the song of the signal hour.
