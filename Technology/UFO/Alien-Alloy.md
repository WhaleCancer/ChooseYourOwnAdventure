# Alien Alloy

**Type:** Material / UFO component  
**Era:** Recovered from crashed craft since 1947

## Overview

Alien craft are constructed from a special alloy with unique properties. This material is extremely light and durable, granting a **+1 bonus to all armor rolls** when used in armor construction.

## Properties

- **Extremely Light** - Much lighter than equivalent terrestrial materials
- **Highly Durable** - Resistant to damage and wear
- **Protective** - Provides enhanced protection when used in armor
- **Unusual Composition** - Made of materials not found on Earth
- **Difficult to Work** - Requires advanced technology to shape or modify

## Recovery

Alien alloy is typically recovered from:

- **Crashed UFOs** - Debris from crashed alien craft
- **Recovered Artifacts** - Objects recovered from alien encounters
- **Government Stockpiles** - Classified materials held by M-EPIC, MJ-12, or other agencies
- **Black Market** - Illegally obtained materials (rare and expensive)

## Uses

- **Armor Construction** - Creating protective equipment with enhanced properties
- **Weapon Components** - Used in advanced weapon construction
- **Research** - Studying the material's properties and composition
- **Reverse Engineering** - Attempting to replicate the material

## Game Mechanics

When alien alloy is used in armor construction, it grants a **+1 bonus to all armor rolls**. This represents the material's superior protective properties.

## In Play

Alien alloy serves as:

- **Rare resource** - Valuable material for equipment construction
- **Investigation hook** - Cases involving recovered alien materials
- **Technology advancement** - Opportunity for reverse engineering
- **Conspiracy element** - Government control and suppression of alien technology
- **Black market item** - Illegally obtained materials creating opportunities for conflict

### Game Considerations

- Alien alloy is extremely rare and valuable
- Government agencies tightly control access to the material
- The material's properties make it highly sought after
- Reverse engineering attempts may lead to new technologies
- Black market trade creates opportunities for criminal elements
