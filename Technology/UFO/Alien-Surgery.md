# Alien Surgery

**Type:** UFO component / Medical technology  
**Era:** Recovered from crashed craft since 1947

## Overview

This surgical equipment uses laser cutters to extract certain body parts from cattle and other animals. The widespread [[Phenomena/Cattle-Mutilations|cattle mutilations]] can be accounted for by this bizarre alien activity. It is likely that these parts are used for nutritional or genetic purposes.

## Technology

Alien surgical equipment features:

- **Laser cutters** - Precise, bloodless incisions
- **Surgical precision** - Clean cuts with no damage to surrounding tissue
- **Specialized extraction** - Designed for removing specific organs or body parts
- **Sterile environment** - Advanced sterilization and containment

## Connection to Cattle Mutilations

This technology directly explains:

- **Surgical precision** - The clean, precise cuts found in mutilation cases
- **Bloodless operations** - The lack of blood at mutilation sites
- **Specific organ removal** - The targeted extraction of eyes, tongue, genitals, etc.
- **No tracks** - The lack of evidence at crime scenes

## Purposes

The extracted body parts are likely used for:

- **Nutritional purposes** - Processing into food or nutrients
- **Genetic research** - Studying biological samples
- **Hybrid programs** - Creating human-alien hybrids
- **Biological experiments** - Testing or analysis

## In Play

Alien surgery serves as:

- **Explanation** - Technology explaining cattle mutilation phenomena
- **Evidence** - Physical proof of alien medical capabilities
- **Threat** - Technology that could be used on humans
- **Investigation target** - Cases involving recovered surgical equipment
- **Conspiracy element** - Government suppression of alien medical technology

### Game Considerations

- Alien surgery provides a technological explanation for mutilations
- The precision creates a sense of advanced alien capabilities
- The connection to mutilations ties into classic X-Files phenomena
- The potential use on humans creates horror elements
- The genetic research angle connects to hybrid programs
