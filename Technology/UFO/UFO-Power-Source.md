# UFO Power Source

**Type:** Technology / Energy system  
**Era:** Recovered from crashed craft since 1947

## Overview

The power source of UFOs is an **anti-matter reactor** which uses **Elerium-115** (element 115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy. The conversion of matter to energy produces an incredible amount of power (E=mc²); even the tiniest amounts of Elerium produce huge amounts of power.

The power source also maintains the **pocket dimension** that allows UFOs to function as they do.

## Elerium-115

**Elerium-115** is a synthetic element (atomic number 115) that does not occur naturally on Earth. It is the key component of alien power systems and is extremely rare and valuable.

### Properties

- **Extremely Dense** - Very heavy for its size
- **Radioactive** - Emits radiation, requiring careful handling
- **Energy Dense** - Tiny amounts produce massive energy
- **Stable** - Does not decay like natural heavy elements
- **Gravity Manipulation** - Generates gravity waves for propulsion

## Anti-Matter Reactor

The anti-matter reactor uses Elerium-115 to:

- **Generate Power** - Producing massive amounts of energy
- **Create Gravity Waves** - Generating gravity fields for propulsion
- **Maintain Pocket Dimensions** - Powering dimensional technology
- **Power Systems** - Operating all UFO systems and equipment

## Grey Engineers

Grey Engineers can modify UFO power systems:

### Improved Thrusters

This module provides greater thrust power and control, allowing for better acceleration and speed. A ship with this module will win a tie-break in combat with another ship of equal speed, unless that ship also has this module. If a ship has two of these modules fitted, the speed category will be increased by one rank.

## Recovery and Research

Elerium-115 and anti-matter reactor technology are:

- **Extremely Rare** - Only found in crashed or captured UFOs
- **Highly Classified** - Government agencies tightly control access
- **Dangerous** - Radioactive and potentially explosive
- **Valuable** - Worth enormous sums on the black market
- **Research Target** - Subject of intense reverse engineering efforts

## In Play

UFO power sources serve as:

- **Technology mystery** - Advanced energy systems beyond human understanding
- **Resource** - Rare and valuable materials for research or use
- **Investigation hook** - Cases involving recovered alien technology
- **Conspiracy element** - Government control and suppression of alien technology
- **Threat** - Dangerous materials requiring careful handling

### Game Considerations

- Elerium-115 is extremely rare and valuable
- The material is radioactive and dangerous
- Government agencies tightly control access
- Reverse engineering attempts may lead to new technologies
- The connection to gravity manipulation and pocket dimensions adds science-fiction elements
