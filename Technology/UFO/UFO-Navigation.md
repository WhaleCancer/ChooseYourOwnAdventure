# UFO Navigation

**Type:** UFO component / Control system  
**Era:** Recovered from crashed craft since 1947

## Overview

Alien craft use sophisticated computers to navigate on earth and through space. The system is based on optical processors arranged in network fashion. The control interface is relatively simple—the navigator controls the direction of gravity waves generated by the power source to move the craft in any direction. This system can be used easily by humans, and it can be reproduced using alien alloys and other components.

## Technology

UFO navigation systems feature:

- **Optical processors** - Advanced computers using light-based processing
- **Network architecture** - Processors arranged in network fashion
- **Gravity wave control** - Directing gravity waves from the power source
- **Simple interface** - Relatively easy for humans to use

## Operation

The navigation system works by:

- **Gravity wave generation** - The [[Technology/UFO/UFO-Power-Source|power source]] generates gravity waves
- **Directional control** - The navigator controls the direction of these waves
- **Movement** - The craft moves in response to gravity wave direction
- **Precision** - Allows for precise movement in any direction

## Human Use

The system can be:

- **Easily used by humans** - Interface is relatively simple
- **Reproduced** - Can be built using alien alloys and components
- **Reverse engineered** - Subject of intense research efforts
- **Adapted** - Modified for human technology

## Grey Navigator Connection

[[Creatures/Aliens/Grey-Navigator|Grey Navigators]] use this system through:

- **Mental Pilot** - Psionic connection to the navigation system
- **Direct interface** - Mental control of gravity wave direction
- **Enhanced performance** - Achieving flight characteristics impossible for normal pilots
- **Remote operation** - Potentially controlling craft from a distance

## Advanced Capabilities

Available in high tech settings, this more powerful version allows for a single jump of up to 20 light years, suggesting:

- **Faster-than-light travel** - Capability for interstellar travel
- **Dimensional manipulation** - Possible connection to pocket dimensions
- **Advanced propulsion** - Beyond simple gravity wave control

## In Play

UFO navigation serves as:

- **Technology explanation** - How UFOs achieve their flight characteristics
- **Reverse engineering target** - Technology humans can potentially replicate
- **Human interface** - Opportunity for humans to pilot alien craft
- **Investigation target** - Cases involving navigation systems
- **Strategic resource** - Valuable technology for military or research purposes

### Game Considerations

- UFO navigation provides a technological explanation for UFO flight
- The human usability creates opportunities for player characters
- The reverse engineering angle creates technological advancement possibilities
- The connection to gravity waves ties into power source technology
- The advanced capabilities suggest interstellar travel possibilities
