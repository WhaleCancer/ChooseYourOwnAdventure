# Alien Food

**Type:** UFO component / Life support  
**Era:** Recovered from crashed craft since 1947

## Overview

These chambers contain various enzymes which are used to digest the body parts of cattle, other animals and even humans. The liquid is then consumed as ready digested food—probably direct to the bloodstream. This suggests a certain dependence on earth for food—a symbiosis between earth and alien society.

## Technology

Alien food processing involves:

- **Digestion chambers** - Containers with enzymes for breaking down organic matter
- **Liquid nutrition** - Processed into ready-digested liquid form
- **Direct consumption** - Injected directly into the bloodstream
- **Efficiency** - Maximum nutritional extraction from organic matter

## Food Sources

The chambers process:

- **Cattle parts** - Organs and tissues from mutilated livestock
- **Other animals** - Various terrestrial creatures
- **Humans** - Body parts from abducted or deceased humans
- **Organic matter** - Any biological material

## Symbiosis Theory

The use of Earth-based organic matter suggests:

- **Dependence on Earth** - Aliens may require terrestrial nutrients
- **Symbiotic relationship** - A connection between alien and Earth ecosystems
- **Harvesting operations** - Ongoing need for biological material
- **Resource extraction** - Earth as a source of food

## High-Tech Alternative

Available in some high tech settings, this module uses a soup of elemental materials to create almost any food or basic item on demand. Most synthesizers are voice activated, and most are pre-loaded with a huge library of items and food. These modules can also be taught to create new items once installed.

## In Play

Alien food serves as:

- **Explanation** - Why aliens mutilate cattle and harvest biological material
- **Horror element** - The processing of human body parts
- **Symbiosis** - A connection between aliens and Earth
- **Resource need** - Ongoing requirement for biological material
- **Investigation clue** - Evidence of alien food processing operations

### Game Considerations

- Alien food processing explains the purpose of mutilations
- The human processing angle adds horror elements
- The symbiosis theory creates interesting world-building
- The resource need explains ongoing alien operations
- The high-tech synthesizer provides an alternative technology path
