# Alien Sensors

**Type:** UFO component / Technology  
**Era:** Recovered from crashed craft since 1947

## Overview

Every starship has enough of a sensor array to operate under normal situations. This module greatly upgrades the existing sensors to either give vastly greater range but with a specialized target (mining, biological, etc.), or else greatly enhance the all-round sensitivity of the array but without increasing the range.

## Capabilities

Alien sensors can be configured for:

- **Specialized targeting** - Mining, biological, energy signatures, or other specific targets with vastly greater range
- **Enhanced sensitivity** - Greatly enhanced all-round sensitivity without increasing range
- **Multiple modes** - Can be reconfigured for different purposes

## Game Mechanics

These sensors grant a **+2 bonus to all sensor tests** within the capabilities of whatever option is fitted.

## Uses

- **Mining operations** - Detecting mineral deposits and resources
- **Biological scanning** - Locating life forms, tracking individuals
- **Energy detection** - Finding power sources, radiation, or other energy signatures
- **Implant monitoring** - Reading signals from alien implants in abductees
- **Surveillance** - Monitoring locations, activities, or individuals

## Recovery and Research

Alien sensor technology is:

- **Extremely rare** - Only found in crashed or captured UFOs
- **Highly classified** - Government agencies tightly control access
- **Reverse engineering** - Subject of intense research efforts
- **Military applications** - Highly sought after for defense purposes

## In Play

Alien sensors serve as:

- **Technology mystery** - Advanced detection systems beyond human understanding
- **Investigation tool** - Using recovered sensors to find targets or evidence
- **Threat** - Aliens using sensors to track or monitor characters
- **Resource** - Valuable technology for research or use
- **Conspiracy element** - Government control and suppression of alien technology

### Game Considerations

- Alien sensors provide advanced detection capabilities
- The specialized modes create opportunities for different investigation approaches
- The connection to implant monitoring creates ongoing threats
- The military applications add strategic value
- The reverse engineering angle creates opportunities for technological advancement
