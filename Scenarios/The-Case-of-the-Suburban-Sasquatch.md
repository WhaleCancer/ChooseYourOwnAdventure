# The Case of the Suburban Sasquatch

**Type:** Investigation scenario  
**Location:** South Surrey, British Columbia  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

A disoriented sasquatch takes up residence in South Surrey. Gardens are being raided, pets begin to disappear.

## Background

The last team was wiped out by insects for shaggi or whatever they are called.

## Scenario Structure

### Pilot: Highway Abduction

The players are travelling along a forested highway towards the Vancouver office. They are abducted.

### Extended: Mi-Go Surgery Sequence

"I have no mouth but I must scream" - Mi-Go surgery sequence.

### Main Investigation: Suburban Sasquatch

A sasquatch has taken up residence in suburban South Surrey, causing:

- Gardens being raided
- Pets disappearing
- Strange sightings and encounters

The agents must investigate and resolve the situation without causing panic or revealing the existence of cryptids to the general public.

## Related Scenarios

- **Fen Stalker:** A Fen Stalker threatens the agents and they barricade themselves in a gas station in interior BC

## In Play

This scenario serves as:

- **Introduction to cryptids** - Players' first encounter with sasquatch
- **Suburban horror** - The juxtaposition of the mundane suburban setting with the supernatural
- **Investigation challenge** - Balancing public safety with secrecy
- **Action sequences** - Potential encounters with the sasquatch and other threats

### Game Considerations

- The suburban setting creates a sense of the uncanny - the familiar made strange
- The disappearance of pets and garden raids provide investigation hooks
- The previous team's fate (wiped out by insects) suggests greater dangers
- The highway abduction in the pilot connects to broader alien activity
- The Mi-Go surgery sequence adds body horror and cosmic horror elements
