# The Case of the Connections Machine

**Type:** Investigation scenario  
**Location:** Vancouver, British Columbia  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

Investigation involving [Orion International](./Factions/Corporations/Orion-International.md) and [ORION AI](./Factions/Corporations/Orion-International#ORION-Supercomputer.md), connected to [Connection Machine](./Technology/UFO/UFO-Power-Source.md) technology and potentially [WABOT](./Creatures/Supernatural/Outsiders/Outsiders-Overview.md) (robotic entities).

## Key Elements

### Connection Machine

The Connection Machine is the advanced computer system that powers ORION AI. This technology may be connected to:

- **ORION AI** - The artificial intelligence system
- **UFO Technology** - Potential connections to alien computer systems
- **Dimensional Rifts** - Technology that may open rifts to other dimensions
- **Robotic Entities** - Connections to WABOT or other robotic beings

### ORION AI Involvement

The case involves:

- **ORION AI** - The AI system may be involved or affected
- **Connection Machine** - The underlying technology
- **MDA** - MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates, owners of ORION
- **Satellite Systems** - Connections to the Orion Belt satellite constellation

## Investigation Hooks

- **Computer anomalies** - Strange behavior from ORION AI or related systems
- **Dimensional rifts** - Technology opening rifts to other dimensions
- **Robotic encounters** - Encounters with WABOT or other robotic entities
- **Corporate conspiracy** - Orion International covering up incidents
- **Technology theft** - Stolen or compromised Connection Machine technology

## In Play

This scenario serves as:

- **Technology investigation** - Cases involving advanced computer systems
- **AI horror** - Rogue AI or AI manipulation scenarios
- **Corporate conspiracy** - Orion International covering up incidents
- **Dimensional threats** - Technology opening rifts to other dimensions
- **Robotic encounters** - Interactions with robotic entities

### Game Considerations

- The Connection Machine provides a technological mystery
- ORION AI adds AI horror and conspiracy elements
- The connection to UFO technology suggests alien influence
- Dimensional rifts create opportunities for planar encounters
- Robotic entities add science-fiction elements
