# The Case of the Invisible Shovel

**Type:** Investigation scenario  
**Location:** Rural farm, British Columbia  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

A farmer has a shovel he is charging people to "see." Lo and behold, it is what it is—an invisible shovel, the result of an incandescent color-draining attack.

## Background

Jim Pattison tries to buy it, and the farmer reports this to authorities. M-EPIC agents will have to use RCMP police powers to confiscate the artifact.

## Key Elements

### The Invisible Shovel

The farmer possesses a shovel that has been drained of color by incandescents, making it transparent. He charges people to "see" it, creating a local curiosity and potential public exposure risk.

### Spiders

There are a lot of spiders in the farmer's house and on his farm since they are drawn to the [[Creatures/Supernatural/Incandescent|Incandescent]]s. The spiders are a natural predator of incandescents, preventing them from becoming a permanent fixture in our dimension.

### Flying Saucer Launch Site

The incandescents are here because there is a nearby location that is frequently used for Flying Saucer launches. This creates a connection to alien activity and dimensional crossings.

### Crop Circles and UFOs

There are crop circles and UFOs nearby. The agents will notice these when they arrive, providing additional evidence of alien activity in the area.

## Investigation Hooks

- **Public exposure risk** - The farmer's "invisible shovel" attraction could expose paranormal phenomena
- **Jim Pattison interest** - The Hand member's attempt to acquire the artifact suggests larger conspiracies
- **Alien activity** - Crop circles and UFO sightings indicate ongoing alien operations
- **Dimensional crossings** - The incandescent presence suggests frequent dimensional activity
- **Spider infestation** - Unusual spider activity may be the first clue agents notice

This scenario serves as:

- **Investigation scenario** - Agents must investigate the invisible shovel and related phenomena
