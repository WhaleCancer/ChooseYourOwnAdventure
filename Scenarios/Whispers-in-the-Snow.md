# Adventure: Whispers in the Snow

**Type:** Scenario / Adventure outline  
**Location:** Porcupine Ridge Research Station, Yukon  
**Era:** 1985

## Overview

The remote **Porcupine Ridge Research Station** in the far Yukon has gone **radio silent** after a breathless message: *"There's something out there—tall, metal, moving through the snow. Not alone…"* With a **major winter storm** bearing down, the PCs are scrambled—scientists, military, or rescue specialists—on the last bush plane in before conditions become impassable. Their goal: **Evacuate survivors**, discover what happened, and secure any sensitive equipment.

## Act 1: Arrival

- **Atmosphere:** The base is half-buried in snow; hazardous winds threaten. No response to calls.
- Find the research camp eerily silent, generator running, lights flickering.
- **Signs:** Deep, inhumanly perfect footprints in the snow; occasional huge humanoid tracks nearby.

## Act 2: Investigation

- **Inside:** Some rooms show signs of panic—broken radio, a smashed window, flecks of strange metallic dust on floors.
- **Logs reveal:** Researchers saw "gleaming figures" outside at night, at the forest's edge—sometimes "moving with impossible silence," sometimes "arguing with something deeper in the woods."
- PCs encounter **malfunctioning security cameras** and strange electrical signals.

## Act 3: The Encounters

- **Outside:**
  - The storm begins—visibility falls, air howls.
  - PCs spot [Tall Robotic Explorers](./Creatures/Aliens/Tall-Robotic-Explorers.md) moving in pairs along tree lines, pausing to scan the snow with glowing lights.
  - PCs may catch glimpses of a **massive, shaggy humanoid silhouette** ([Sasquatch](./Creatures/Cryptids/Sasquatch.md)) staying well away from the robots.
- **Tension:** The Explorers are clearly looking for "the subject"—Sasquatch—and are ignoring humans unless provoked, but seem increasingly agitated by the storm and interference from other lifeforms.

## Act 4: The Truth

Hidden camera footage or surviving scientists reveal:

- The researchers had been tracking what they believed to be a **Yukon Sasquatch**.
- The **robots arrived several nights ago**, quickly and silently, apparently **to capture or observe the Sasquatch**.
- When the humans intervened, chaos erupted—power surges, violence, and one Explorer using a **paralyzing ray** on a staff member.
- The Sasquatch, displaying intelligence, sabotaged power and created distractions to protect itself…and perhaps the humans.

## Act 5: Decisions Under Pressure

The storm closes in—escape by air is nearly impossible unless power is restored and a makeshift runway is cleared.

The PCs face choices:

- **Evacuate with vital data/survivors**, risking conflict with the Explorers.
- **Assist the wounded/terrified Sasquatch**, perhaps gaining its trust and aid for escape.
- **Attempt to capture evidence of the Explorers**, knowing it will profoundly impact human understanding of the unknown.

A final confrontation may occur as the Explorers close on the Sasquatch or as the PCs attempt escape, with the angry robots, the wild beast, and the storm reaching their climax all at once.

## Aftermath

If the PCs survive, they may be left with evidence, a secret pact with the Sasquatch, or haunting memories—knowing that **the wild places still hold secrets, and not all are of this world**.

## Themes and Twists

- **The Explorers only want the Sasquatch**, avoiding lethal force against humans unless blocked.
- The **Sasquatch is not a mindless beast**, possibly communicating non-verbally or showing signs of technological sabotage against the robots.
- Storm becomes a character of its own—limiting options, adding urgency, and possibly aiding escape or cover.

## Instigating Events

1. **Power Flicker and Generator Alarm** The base's lights suddenly dim and flicker. An alarm sounds from the generator room, indicating a malfunction. Without power, the base will lose heat—and the radios will remain dead. Repairs must be made, but strange metallic residue is found in the machinery.

2. **Exterior Movement Caught on Sensors** A motion sensor alert blares—the external cameras (briefly operational) catch a glimpse of a Tall Robotic Explorer standing unmoving at the tree line. Moments later, the camera feed goes static. Evidence of an intruder is undeniable.

3. **Footprints in the Snow** PCs checking the perimeter or returning from an outbuilding find two sets of footprints: the deep, mechanical-tread prints of the Explorers—and much larger, barefoot prints moving between the trees in erratic patterns. Suddenly, a distant, guttural howl echoes through the storm, urging investigation.

4. **Vanishing Crew Member (or Body)** If any NPCs survived, one goes missing while retrieving supplies (or the PCs discover a half-buried body, paralyzed but alive). Blood trails or drag marks lead into the woods, away from safety.

5. **Barrage of Metallic "Probes"** Glowing metallic spheres (the Explorers' drones) zip past the windows, scanning the buildings. One enters through an open vent, activates, and must be disabled or avoided before it calls in the main robots.

6. **Strange Radio Transmission** A burst of garbled, inhuman static blares from the radios—then a split second of what sounds like a terrified human voice. The radio crackles, then dies, but the voice seemed to come from somewhere *nearby*.

7. **Paralyzing Ray Victim** PCs stumble upon a crew member or local trapper (semi-conscious, shivering, eyes wild) in the snow. They're alive, but unresponsive and rigid—a victim of the Explorers' ray. They recover slowly but can share a fragmentary warning.

8. **Storm Escalates/Impending Doom** The storm's winds pick up, causing a section of the roof or an outbuilding to collapse. An avalanche or fallen tree threatens to block their only route to the airstrip or outpost, giving them a time limit to act.

9. **Desperate Sasquatch** Through a window or during a search, the PCs glimpse the Sasquatch up close—hiding, wounded, and clearly afraid of the robots. It makes direct (albeit silent or nonverbal) pleas for help, tossing a stolen piece of robot hardware at the PCs' feet as a sign of trust.

10. **Direct Assault** One (or more) Robotic Explorers begin advancing toward the base. They activate external lights, scan the building's walls, and attempt to force open a door or window. If PCs don't intervene, the base's interior will soon be compromised.
