## Episode Ideas

### S01E01 "Electropsychometer"

Scientology Church but it is Arboria. In Vancouver, the Church of Scientology has occupied the corner of Hastings and Homer since 1980 — it incorporated as a church in 1971 — with volcano-adorned window displays of Dianetics (the book that started it all) and signs beckoning passersby to drop in for a free personality test. Protected by the VPD.

### S01EXX "Suppressive Persons"

The church of scientology launches a smear campaign on the PCs, endangering their cover.

### S01E02 "Narconon"

In the early 1980s, the DTES was an edgy but still relatively calm place to live. The neighbourhood began a marked shift before Expo 86, when an estimated 800 to 1,000 tenants were evicted from DTES residential hotels to make room for tourists. With the increased tourist traffic of Expo 86, dealers introduced an influx of high-purity cocaine and heroin. In efforts to clean up other areas of the city, police cracked down on the cocaine market and street prostitution, but these activities resurfaced in the DTES. Within the DTES, police officers gave up on arresting the huge numbers of individual drug users, and chose to focus their efforts on dealers instead.

Meanwhile, the provincial government adopted a policy of de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, leading to the mass discharge of Riverview Hospital's patients, with the promise that they would be integrated into the community. Between 1985 and 1999, the number of patient-days of care provided by B.C. psychiatric hospitals declined by nearly 65%. Many of the de-institutionalized mentally ill moved to the DTES, attracted by the accepting culture and low-cost housing, but they floundered without adequate treatment and support and soon became addicted to the neighbourhood's readily available drugs.

Between 1980 and 2002, more than 60 women went missing from the DTES, most of them sex workers. Robert Pickton, who had a farm east of the city where he held "raves", was charged with the murders of 26 of these women and convicted on six counts in 2007. He claimed to have murdered 49 women. As of 2009, an estimated 39 women were still missing from the Downtown Eastside.

### S01EXX "Bountiful"

The first member of the group that bought property near Lister was Harold (aka) Michael Blackmore, who moved there with his family in 1946. Other members of the church who believed in the principles of plural marriages soon followed. After Winston Blackmore became the bishop in the 1980s, the group took the name of Bountiful.

## Adventure Ideas

### VHS Tape Fungus

A VHS tape that is infected with fungal spores; the spores release when the tape is played. The VCRs have spores left in it. Can reference Videomatica and historic VHS places.

Because it is a 2 day rental but it takes 7 days for the spores to germinate.

### Riverview Mental Hospital

Riverview mental hospital as a Black Rainbow type facility. #Psionics
