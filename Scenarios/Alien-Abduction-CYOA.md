# Alien Abduction CYOA

**Type:** Scenario / Choose Your Own Adventure  
**Era:** 1985  
**Overview:** A structured scenario framework for running alien abduction encounters based on the typical abduction narrative.

## Overview

The narrative of the abduction phenomenon follows a consistent sequence of events. This CYOA framework provides a structured way to run abduction scenarios, allowing the Director to guide players through the typical abduction experience while maintaining narrative control.

## Abduction Sequence

Most abduction accounts feature the following events, generally following this sequence:

1. **Capture** - The abductee is forcibly taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien space craft.
2. **Examination** - Invasive medical or scientific procedures are performed on the abductee.
3. **Conference** - The abductors speak to the abductee.
4. **Tour** - The abductees are given a tour of their captors' vessel.
5. **Loss of Time** - Abductees rapidly forget the majority of their experience.
6. **Return** - The abductees are returned to earth. Occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.
7. **Theophany** - The abductee has a profound mystical experience, accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God or the universe.
8. **Aftermath** - The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.

## Abduction Types

### Bed Abduction

Most abductees report being taken from their bedroom prior to falling asleep. Typically, at the onset of the abduction experience, the abductee will report paralysis, sighting a bright light, and the appearance of humanoid figures.

### Abduction by Car

In many abduction reports, the individual(s) concerned are traveling by automobile at the time of the incident, usually at night or in the early morning hours, and usually in a rural or sparsely populated area. A UFO will be seen ahead (sometimes on the road), and the driver will either deliberately stop to investigate, or the car will stop due to apparent mechanical failure. Other forms of mechanical failure and interference are also common, such as a car radio producing static or behaving abnormally.

Upon getting out of the vehicle, the driver and passenger(s) often will experience a blank period and amnesia (see Missing Time), after which they will find themselves again standing in front of, or driving their car. While they frequently will not consciously remember the experience, either subsequent nightmares or hypnosis will reveal events interpreted as having occurred during the period lacking explicit memory.

## Technology

Some reports indicate the alleged aliens, often the Greys, using a pencil-sized, black device with a light on the end of it to make the abductee compliant. This is the [Visitor Wand](./#Visitor Wand.md).

## Procedures

### Examination

Invasive medical or scientific procedures are performed on the abductee. This may include:

- Physical examination
- Sample collection (blood, tissue, etc.)
- Implant insertion
- Reproductive procedures (for female abductees)
- Sperm collection (for male abductees)

### Conference

The abductors speak to the abductee, often through telepathy or through a translator device. The content of these conversations varies but may include:

- Warnings about environmental destruction
- Messages about human evolution
- Instructions or commands
- Reassurance or threats

### Implant

Small objects may be inserted under the skin or in the bodies of abductees. These implants are often discovered through medical examination or X-rays and are considered physical evidence of alien contact.

### Return

The abductees are returned to earth, often with:

- Missing time
- New injuries or marks
- Disheveled clothing
- Confusion about location
- Fragmented memories

## Visitor Wand

A pencil-sized, black device with a light on the end used by Greys to make abductees compliant. The device appears to have paralyzing or mind-control capabilities.

## In Play

This CYOA framework allows Directors to:

- **Structure abduction scenarios** - Follow the typical abduction narrative
- **Maintain player agency** - Allow choices within the framework
- **Create tension** - Build suspense through the sequence of events
- **Handle missing time** - Structure memory loss and recovery
- **Explore aftermath** - Deal with psychological and physical consequences

### Game Considerations

- Not all abductions feature all events - Directors can pick and choose
- The sequence can be modified based on story needs
- Players may resist or attempt to escape at various points
- SANITY loss should be tracked throughout the experience
- Memory recovery can be a source of investigation hooks
